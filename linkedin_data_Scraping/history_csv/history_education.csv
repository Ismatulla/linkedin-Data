Postdoc position in the Classical roots of,"Applications are invited for a fully funded two-year Postdoc position within the research project Classical roots of (early) modern colonization at Groningen University (UG) and the Royal Netherlands Institute in Rome (KNIR), coordinated by Prof. dr. Tesse Stek and Dr. Jeremia Pelgrom.

As we see vividly in the current newspapers, colonization and its impacts form one of the most defining forces in human history. As such, colonization has been a crucial phenomenon in the making of the modern globalized world. Although the impact of colonization on the modern world order is well known, and is currently object of fierce academic and societal debate, the deep historical roots of colonial ideologies and practices have remained underexplored.

Recent colonization studies on the impact and organization of colonial rule, and on the ideologies that have shaped these practices, show the long history and resilience of colonial paradigms. Ultimately, these paradigms originate in classical antiquity. Classical models of colonization, themselves manifold and pluriform, thus continue to shape the organization of the modern world – both implicitly and explicitly.

The project Classical roots of (early) modern colonization aims to shed light on this intricate relationship between the classical past and the (early) modern world. The project is organized as part of the Caput Mundi initiative between the University of Groningen and the Royal Netherlands Institute in Rome. Caput Mundi aims to intensify the connections between UG and KNIR and its international network. By focusing on interdisciplinary research, Caput Mundi broadens the research community that profits from the KNIR and establishes connections between different UG faculties and departments. Within the context of the Caput Mundi network, research themes are developed. The Classical roots of (early) modern colonization program is the first theme, and will run for 5 years. It brings different scholars together that are currently working in different departments and faculties, in particular archaeology, ancient history, classics, American studies, Roman law, international studies and religion studies, and more may follow.

The research theme group is reinforced by establishing a Postdoc position funded by the KNIR – UG collaboration impulse. The Postdoc will work on the use of classical themes in premodern and modern colonization and colonialism. He/she will make use of the KNIR to access the invaluable libraries, archives and expertise housed in Rome’s (foreign) institutes, universities and museums. The primary research questions revolve around the historical choices that were made as to which classical examples were to be developed further as a basis to build, understand or justify contemporary colonial societies, and which ones were instead to be ignored. Departing from various strands in the conceptualization of colonization in the classical past, case-studies are developed across the globe. In particular, the reception and use of Roman colonization in the pre-modern and modern Americas, and in Indonesia will be the object of study by a multidisciplinary team.

The project: Classical Models in Dutch Colonial discourses
The postdoc project is expected to employ an intellectual history perspective on the ideologies and practices that shaped Dutch colonization in the East (e.g., modern-day Indonesia) and/or the West (New Netherlands/ Brazil, Caribbean etc.). Particular attention is devoted to the role of classical (i.e., ancient Greek and Roman) discourses and themes that influenced colonial policy makers and communities in shaping their settlements and their relations with their mother-city and the surrounding communities. The postdoc project takes a broad/conceptual/ critical approach to the influence of classical ideology and texts in (early) modern colonization by the Dutch.

You will be asked to:

propose a relevant and well documented research strategy
write (co-authored) A rated journal articles
do archival research in Rome
co-supervise PhD and MA research projects
co-manage the research network and (co-)organize research, didactic and outreach activities within the Classical roots of (early) modern colonization progra
contribute to the acquisition of further funding for the continuity of the research program
participate, limitedly, in the teaching program as part of the regular curriculum of KNIR.
Qualifications
a relevant PhD in history, classics, or another related discipline
a strong international research profile and network
high impact publications
demonstrated interest in conceptual and theoretical aspects of colonial discourses
an independent, proactive work ethic and experience with autonomous archival research in e.g., Rome, the Vatican and other relevant archives
a flexible, mobile and internationally oriented mentality
excellent academic writing skills in English
(at least) passive knowledge of Italian and other relevant languages.

Join the Groups of Public Building and History of Architecture and Urban Planning to investigate new building types for healthy environments through data-driven design processes.
Job description
The Group of Public Building with the Group of History of Architecture and Urban Planning is inviting applications for one PhD position in the Department of Architecture to explore the theme of developing data driven spatial scenarios for healthy public buildings and environments. This is a research position for 4 years, funded by the Sector Plan Design Engineering Science. You will develop your own research under the guidance of the scientific staff in the groups of Public Building and History of Architecture and Urban Planning.

As stated by the 2030 UN-Habitat Agenda for Sustainable Development with its 17 goals, designers are urgently required to rethink the way architecture and the urban environment can be conceived and built, by taking into consideration not only new paradigms – see the concept of resilience from an economic, social, and environmental viewpoint, but also the usage of new data driven research and design tools as well as more sustainable building methods. In line with the concept of climate justice, sustainable solutions need to include all aspects of health and well-being. Many of contemporary challenges in health are a result of decade-long policies on working and living. It is time to use research-based design as a decisive factor for reducing the spatial and social inequalities that characterize the built environment.

The selected PhD candidate will collect relevant data on the design and construction of healthy buildings, taking a long-term perspective. This data research will facilitate understanding of complex spatial, social and cultural conditions that have deep historical roots and are often embedded in path dependencies. The PhD candidate will develop a scientifically balanced method for improving the quality of the living environment to future use through creative (re)design. They will work closely with the scientific staff to interpret the data needed for a comprehensive assessment of public health as a foundation for data-driven design interventions. Design of environments and spaces based on long-term investigation on health can stimulate the creation of healthy spatial conditions as the foundation for the design disciplines to confront new urgent problems: climate change, increasing inequality, limited access to resources and public health.

In support of the research-by-design method under development by the Group of Public Building and in line with the long-term exploration of the Group of History of Architecture and Urban Planning, the PhD candidate will investigate new spatial and typological articulations – buildings that can act as social catalyst for entire urban areas and that can improve quality of life collectively. In considering design as a decisive factor for reducing the spatial and social inequalities that characterize the built environment, the Groups of Public Building and History of Architecture and Urban Planning at TU Delft aim to implement an educational and research model that embraces cooperation, along with experimentation and digitalization with a focus on health in public buildings and spaces. The successful candidate will also be required to contribute to teaching programs of the Groups.
Requirements
You have:

Completed an MSc degree in Architecture, with a focus on Architectural Design;
Awareness of and interest in long term developments;
Previous experience in data-driven projects, as well as in coding, scripting, and artificial intelligence, preferably with an awareness of space-based processes;
Familiarity with spatial data analysis, the use of geographic information systems (e.g. ArcGIS) and 3D modelling (e.g. BIM);
Familiarity with research by design and data-driven design processes for example with software programs like Rhino, Revit, Grasshopper;
Excellent Master study results;
Previous research experience in a transdisciplinary setting;
Ability to work collaboratively with others (students, faculty, and staff) to create a supportive research and learning environment.

It is nice if you have:

At least 2 years of experience with working in a design office for architecture and/or urban design.

Doing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and a final thesis.

Job description
Signs of hydration are present on the surface of most planetary and airless small bodies of the Solar System. The study of such features is of interest for the search for the origins of life in the Solar System as water is one of the building blocks. On airless planetary bodies, the water can be found either solid as water ice or as hydrated minerals resulting from an ancient flow of liquid water on the surface. Hydration can be detected through infrared spectroscopic observations of the planetary body, each state of water leaving a characteristic feature in the resulting spectrum. Investigations of these hydration signs through high-resolution spectroscopy could bring information on the composition and structure of the observed surface, from which the formation mechanism and alteration history of the body can be derived.

Current space exploration missions observe the surface of airless bodies for traces of hydration using imaging spectrometers sensitive in the infrared. However, instrumental limitations often reduces the spectral resolution and increase the spectral step, which prevents an accurate deduction of the precise composition and structure. To retrieve compositional information of the target through the hydration band, instrumental requirements have to be defined during the development of the new imaging spectrometers.

This PhD project proposes to investigate the links between the hydration features observed in infrared spectroscopy and the composition and crystalline structure of the studied surface. The effects of surface alteration on the hydration features will also be studied. The investigations will be performed in the laboratory using terrestrial and meteoritical samples, and results will be compared to in-situ observations of planetary bodies. Finally, the laboratory results will be used to determine spectral requirements of future spectro-imagers intended for planetary exploration missions.
Requirements
The candidate holds a master degree in planetary sciences, astronomy, physics or equivalent
The candidate is familiar with chemistry/geology laboratories through practical courses or internship/thesis, and shows a strong interest for practical work
The candidate must show excellent written and spoken English skills

Location: AMSTERDAM

FTE: 0.8 - 1
Job description
This position will contribute to inclusive, fair and sustainable innovation in the health and life sciences, by addressing sector and industry challenges related to innovation and business models. In the biopharmaceutical industry, there is increasing attention for innovation deficits in the market that may be related to significant system and market failures associated with established dominant business models. Such innovation deficits not only relate to financial metrics, but more importantly also result in failures to deliver on society’s most pressing unmet needs. While current business models have become dominant as they reflect the most efficient way to use the resources available to capture and deliver value, they have not been optimized for delivering societal value. Novel, sustainable business models can more adequately deliver on unmet societal needs, and enable transformation of the current innovation system into a sustainable new configuration that adequately addresses and balances people, planet and profit dimensions.


Your duties

Your research approach should be collaborative, with the aim of studying such innovation system challenges and contributing to the sustainability of innovation and business management in life sciences. You build upon proven insight into emerging science and technology that could be the starting point for such system transitions, and an understanding of the valuation and appropriation of tangible and intangible value. In addition to qualitative analysis of sustainable business model dimensions, you will build on the capacity for empirical research and quantitative analyses to fundamentally support this line of research as well as complement and extend the Athena Institute’s research portfolio.


Research at the Athena Institute includes transdisciplinary approaches that involve issue-identification and the exploration of solutions developed in collaboration with actors and stakeholders. The Athena centers its research around four research themes: Emerging science and technology; (Global) health and well-being; Nature, agriculture and environment; Competency development in inter- and transdisciplinary research; and History of knowledge. The successful candidate should be able to build upon proven insight into emerging science and technology and is expected to collaborate with different colleagues in projects across these research themes.


Requirements
A PhD in Management studies, innovation studies, or a related (inter)discipline; an additional background in the health and life sciences is a strong plus;
Fluent in English (and knowledge of Dutch);
Strong and relevant publication track-record, complementing and extending the Athena Institute’s research portfolio, specifically in terms of quantitative analyses;
Teaching experience (e.g., as course instructor, thesis supervisor, etc.);
A university teaching qualification (BKO) or commitment to obtaining it during the tenure track;
Strong collaborator within interdisciplinary teams (listening, flexible, adaptive, pro-active);
Experience with applying for research grants and externally funded projects and ability to meet deadlines and produce deliverables;
Entrepreneurial and relevant business experience;
An (inter)national network relevant to the research lines.

NewGlobe works within state and national curriculum and syllabi, ensuring all children are empowered to learn their own history, and master local content, while being globally competitive in mathematics and languages. The science of behaviour change and the science of learning is at the foundation of all programming.
NewGlobe works with urgency because youth quickly becomes adulthood and relentlessly because improvement requires continuous problem-solving. NewGlobe is honoured to serve and to help rebuild trust in public systems.
NewGlobe’s work is all encompassing and will challenge you to use your full mind, and heart, each day. We need bright minds who want to be part of building a new globe - a more equitable globe - to join us.
New Opportunities Group
New Opportunities brings the majority of our extensive breadth of technical expertise to ensure large scale transformation of education systems into one team. This team kick-starts new programs in new countries. Each member of the team is responsible for a core area of expertise, and then setting up all work and functions related to that expertise in the new program/new country. This includes putting all relevant policies, practices, systems and technology in place, and leading the hiring of the leader who will take charge of this work as the permanent lead for this body of work. This is NewGlobes SWAT team, with specialists brought together to solve the critical and urgent problem of launching a state or nation-wide new program. This team must work collaboratively, thrive in creating order out of chaos, and understand that proactive problem solving is a daily task. All members of this team should expect extensive travel to remote and underserved areas, and to be resident in 2 other locations per year, setting up new programs. When not deployed on starting a specific program, each team member will do work with the core technical team which he or she represents, to support special projects, deepen technical knowledge, and otherwise advance in the field. This team is critical to NewGlobe delivering on our shared vision of transforming the lives of 10,000,000+ children, and in so doing seeing peace and prosperity where we work.
Technology
Technology plays a critical role enabling us to provide transformative education at massive scale in highly resource constrained environments. This is one of the key elements that gives us the ability to deliver radically impactful programmes, creating brighter futures for a generation of children across the world each day. Technology spans several key functions, including Product Management, Business Intelligence, Software Development, and IT Operations.
About the Role
Technology at NewGlobe is a highly complex, vertically-integrated affair, with systems supporting an ever expanding range of functions and countries, and crossing between software development, business intelligence, IT operations, and logistics/supply chain. At the same time, our teams run lean and things change fast – governments make policy decisions that affect us, launching new territories is a frenetic affair, and we still need to evolve our core technology offering.
This role is about ensuring that NewGlobes investments in technology translate into rapid and reliable launches, appropriately localised offerings, and sustainable at-scale operations. To achieve that, it will require deep knowledge of the existing NewGlobe tools and processes, an exceptional ability to collaborate, listen, and communicate, and a passion for continuous improvement. Above all else, this role is about being a technologist who can be a fast-moving and utterly resilient problem solver, while simultaneously being obsessed with ensuring the scale and sustainability of our operations.
When deployed as part of a new launch, this person will be on-ground as the Technology representative in the cross-functional New Opportunities team, adapting and deploying the existing set of tools and processes and infrastructure to the local context, hiring and training the future IT Operations team, and generally doing whatever is necessary. To achieve that goal, this person will be supported by and oversee a small globally distributed technology team assigned to the launch, including staff from both software development and IT Operations. But it will also mean rolling up sleeves, doing systems administration, installing software, working with local vendors, and whatever else is necessary to make the technology go.
When not participating in a new launch, this person will be catching up on the latest developments within the Technology group and working to make the next launch better, faster, cheaper.
This person will report to the Vice President of New Opportunities, with a functional reporting line to the CTO. This person will be a member of the core Technology Leadership team, alongside directors owning the IT Operations, Software Development, Product Management, and Programme Management functions, respectively.
What You Will Do

Hire and on-board the IT Operations manager and team (up to 10+) who will take over operations post-launch
Support academics and leadership and development teams to provide tech support for teacher trainings for up to 10,000 teachers in first 3 months in-country
Manage the local hardware and infrastructure setup, under the oversight of the shared services IT Operations director, to ensure that support office infrastructure (internet, PBX, firewalls, domain controllers, etc.), IT assets (smartphones, tablets, laptops, etc.), and tech consumables (software licenses, airtime, etc.) are procured and available in a way that is timely, cost-effective, and consistent with established NewGlobe standards.
Build awareness and perform training around the existing technology toolset for the local teams, including new products or functionality that might not have existed in prior launches
Ensure the right balance between standardisation (including pushing back on local teams to adopt) and localisation (including pushing back on shared services teams to adapt)
Oversee the technology shared services teams assigned to a launch, including prioritisation of issues for resolution, necessary customisations, and the coordination of associated timelines and releases. Changes to software systems to be overseen by the shared services Software Development director.
Act as the single point of contact on ground for Technology during a launch, meaning communicating a clear and complete picture back to the Technology Leadership teams and also communicating information back from those teams to the local teams
Prevent shadow systems and misinformation from becoming embedded
Between launches, work with other technology departments and functions to improve future launches, including product strategy, software development, IT Operations, and business intelligence
Advocate relentlessly for - and personally embrace - the use of data and reports to drive facts-based and at-scale decision making

What You Should Have

Experience deploying and overseeing technology in low infrastructure and physically remote environments - limited or unreliable access to power, limited or unreliable access to network, difficult or slow to reach in person, and often using low spec hardware.
Experience that includes mobile applications and enterprise mobility management are a big plus.
Experience working across multiple teams and departments, especially in a globally distributed and matrixed organisation.
Strong project management skills, especially with both lean processes that are designed to work in rapidly changing environments and also with more formal structures designed for complex and well-defined projects
Understanding of networking infrastructure (routers, switches, firewalls, domain controllers) and the associated setup and configuration
Competency with other types of systems administration tasks, esp. Linux-based systems, such as PBXs, LAMP-stack OSS, etc.
Familiarity with ITIL, Information Security, and Identity Management best practices.
Experience participating in modern software development and continuous delivery processes, including automated deployment pipelines, microservice APIs, frequent releases, and fast feedback
Proficiency in the use of monitoring tools to oversee systems at a distance and at scale (and to reduce mean time to response)
Exceptional listening, communication, and collaboration skills
7+ years relevant IT/industry work experience
Bachelor's degree with strong academic performance
Experience of living and/or working in emerging markets, including rural and remote communities .

EngD student on Deep learning to detect bitmap artefacts,"Job description
The Electronic Systems (ES) group within the Department of Electrical Engineering of Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) and Canon Production Printing are seeking to hire an outstanding EngD candidate within the field of Embedded Computer Vision.
Candidate
Canon Production printing develops high-end digital inkjet printer systems for the high-volume and graphic arts professional printing markets. In such printers’ high-resolution bitmaps are prepared for printing using a fast image processing implementation that is able to match the demanding data rate requirements of the systems. This image processing ensures that the prints are delivered with the best possible print quality and without any artifacts.
To ensure that the image quality targets are met, the image processing implementations are rigorously tested, both using offline tooling and by printing extensive test sets on real printers. However, finding artifacts is a challenge due to the bulk of data, and sometimes feels like looking for a needle in a haystack: Visually inspecting the output bitmaps that contain hundreds of millions of pixels is very labor intensive, as is looking for artifacts in big stacks of paper.
Canon Production Printing is looking at ways to improve the identification of print artifacts in image processing output in order to further improve the quality of our deliveries. One of the planned improvement steps is the integration of machine learning algorithms during regression testing as a way to help the developers identify print artifacts in the image processing output before the software is released to be integrated into the print engine software.
This EngD project will consist of deep learning algorithm development and recreation/simulation of image quality artifacts. To obtain training data for the machine learning, existing (mostly artifact-free) regression test-sets can be used. In addition, miscellaneous types of artifacts can be (re-) created by building past versions of the software, as well as by manipulation of input data to the software. Additional artifacts may be simulated by adjusting the image processing output bitmaps. The training data will be used to create deep neural networks with the goal of flagging test cases where the output is expected to contain artifacts. For this application, a good network should combine high processing speed with good classification performance. The resulting network will be integrated into the build and test environment to run during (daily) regression testing and automated builds, where it should flag the bitmaps most likely to contain image artifacts. These bitmaps can then be inspected further manually.
Electronic Systems group at TU/e and Canon Production Printing
The Electronic Systems group consists of seven full professors, two associate professors, eight assistant professors, several postdocs, about 40 EngD and PhD candidates and support staff. The ES group is world-renowned for its design automation and embedded systems research. It is our ambition to provide a scientific basis for design trajectories of electronic systems, ranging from digital circuits to cyber-physical systems. The trajectories are constructive and lead to high quality, cost-effective systems with predictable properties (functionality, timing, reliability, power dissipation, and cost).
Canon is global leader in consumer and professional imaging. One of Canon’s goals is to be the #1 in printing. Our strategic imperative and incentive is to constantly look for opportunities to improve our organization, business, culture and brand and to proactively pursue our ambitions. Founded in 1877 in Venlo, the Netherlands, Canon Production Printing has a long history of technical innovation and development. A key asset is inkjet, a game-changing and widely applicable imaging technology. Our ambition is to build on our expertise in jetting for high-volume, high-speed printing and to position ourselves as a thought leader in jetting technology and applications.

PhD's on Informal Economies in Post-pandemic resilient communities,"We are offering a 36-month PhD position (full time, 1.0 FTE) within the Industrial Doctorate project Post-pandemic resilient communities: is the informal economy a reservoir for the next generation of digitalized and green businesses in Africa, Asia and Latin America? (HORIZON-MSCA-2021-DN-01, GA 101073394)

What is an Industrial Doctorate?
An MSCA – Industrial Doctorate is a programme funded by Horizon Europe thanks to which Junior Researchers can enroll in a PhD programme while being employed 18 months by a university and 18 months by a non-academic partner (think tank, company, NGO, see list below). Successful fellows will receive a salary for three years, at the EU early Stage Researcher rate (total amount depending on the country where they will be based in) and an allowance for mobility, research, family in line with EU guidelines that can be viewed here:
https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/2021-2027/horizon/wp-call/2021-2022/wp-2-msca-actions_horizon-2021-2022_en.pdf

The programme is aimed at producing PhD holders with already a strong work experience and thus already competitive on the job market.

Main objectives of the programme
If successful, you will be enrolled in a PhD programme in the University of Groningen and work in a team of academic and non-academic specialists to conduct a multi-level study on informality in Thailand or Ecuador, involving a) Horizon Scanning; b) Delphi Survey; c) Construction of Case Studies, to identify the sectors of the economy that have been most affected by the pandemic, the sectors that could lead economic recovery and the policies needed to make this recovery durable and sustainable in the long term; the final goal is the training of junior experts on informality in the Global South with exposure to both academic and non-academic sector opportunities; the output includes a database, PhD thesis, scientific publications, policy publications, and communication activities.

Short description of the project and its focus
In addition to the almost 2bln workers already active in the informal sector, World Bank and ILO estimate that the pandemic might have put at risk of precarious employment 500mln-1.5bln more workers. These losses, and related consequences, are not evenly distributed given that Africa, Asia and Latin America is where 93% of the world’s informal employment is located and where post-pandemic crisis is likely to hit harder (especially women, migrants and young people). Yet, the concern is global. Indeed, besides vulnerability and precariousness at individual and community levels, informality also eventually reduces state capacity and the ability of institutions to design and implement policies that properly address social, economic and environmental issues (i.e. SDGs) in a long term perspective. Accordingly, informality-related challenges have been devoted a great deal of attention and political statements. But seldom have these statements been followed by concrete instructions, guidelines or evidence-based policies to tackle informality across the world. Starting from this gap, PRESILIENT is a large network comprising 14 partners (of which 7 nonacademic) and 15 associated partners located in Africa, Asia-Pacific and Latin America committed to delivering a world class cross-regional training on informality in the Global South to: measure it, address it, find viable and sustainable alternatives. By doing this, we have committed to four main objectives: 1 train the next generation of experts on informality in the global south; 2 carry out a research spanning 15 different countries and to produce novel data and significant theoretical advancements in the field; 3 produce strategic intelligence that can be used to provide practical policy recommendations; 4 enable multi-directional knowledge transfer through network events, pairing of academic and non-academic partners (who will jointly supervise each fellow), secondment and task-based teamwork.

The Department of History of Philosophy of the Faculty of Philosophy, Theology and Religious Studies invites candidates for a new tenured position in the History of Modern Physics, which will both strengthen the teaching and research expertise of the Center for the History of Philosophy and Science (CHPS) and contribute to the new project on determinism, randomness and emergence in modern physics led by Spinoza laureate Klaas Landsman at the Faculty of Science.

You should be well versed in the history of science, especially in the context of modern theories of physics, such as quantum theory, general relativity, and/or statistical mechanics. You should be willing to contribute to both the general research programme of CHPS, which studies philosophy and science as historically intertwined fields, and to the specific themes of Professor Landsman's project.

You will be expected to teach courses at the Bachelor's and Master's levels, varying from Bachelor's courses in the History of Science and in Philosophy to Master's courses on topics related to your research, which should, however, also be accessible to philosophy students without a mathematical or physical background. You supervise students writing their Bachelor's or Master's theses.

The position will initially be at the Assistant Professor level, with a track towards Associate Professorship. Women are especially welcome to apply. The position will consist of 50% teaching, 45% research and 5% administration.
Profile
You hold a PhD in the history of science or in a related discipline, with a research focus on the history of modern physics (notably on quantum theory, general relativity, and/or statistical mechanics).
You are able to teach courses in the History of Science and in Philosophy, varying from bachelor courses to master courses, which should be accessible to philosophy students without a mathematical or physical background.
You are an inspiring teacher, preferably with experience at both BA and MA level.
You are proficient in Dutch (C2 level) and English (C1 level) or are willing to achieve these levels within two to three years. Obtaining these levels and being able to teach in both languages is a criterion for tenure.
You have a strong publication record, appropriate to career stage.
You have concrete plans for a future grant proposal (ERC or NWO).
You are preferably in possession of a University Teaching Qualification (UTQ) or are willing to obtain it within two years.
You enjoy working as part of a multidisciplinary research group.
We are
The Faculty of Philosophy, Theology and Religious Studies houses over 160 staff and over 1,000 students from the Netherlands and abroad. Our educational programme includes several top-notch degree programmes and has both in-depth disciplinary fields of study and interdisciplinary and interfaculty study programmes. The faculty provides innovative teaching and research programmes with a strong focus on current social issues.


The Department of the History of Philosophy brings together historians of philosophy and historians of science in a single teaching and research unit. As far as teaching is concerned, the Department provides courses in the history of philosophy from Antiquity to the current age for the Faculty's Bachelor's, Master's, and Research Master's programmes. As far as research is concerned, the Center for the History of Philosophy and Science (CHPS), investigates the evolution of natural philosophy from Antiquity to the 21st century. It pays particular attention to the period between 1250 and 1700, and to the consequences of the fragmentation of the Aristotelian worldview into the manifold of modern scientific disciplines. This fragmentation of natural philosophy into different sciences, which no longer share common ontological and epistemological premises, raises important questions for contemporary philosophers, which are also addressed by CHPS. The reception of ancient philosophy in modern and contemporary thought is also crucial in the Department's research. Research and teaching topics include the notions of place/space, time, matter, motion, chance and necessity, but also soul, mind and cognition. Within the global academic landscape, CHPS is unique in approaching the history of philosophy and the history of science as historically intertwined phenomena. For this reason, it has attracted staff, PhD candidates, and postdoctoral researchers from many countries, and functions as an international hub for scholars interested in the combination of the history of philosophy and the history of science. In addition to addressing academic peers, CHPS also reaches out to a wider audience to contribute to a better understanding of the historical trajectory that has led to today's science and technology-driven society.

Our faculty is committed to equal opportunities for all. We stand for an inclusive community and believe that diversity contributes to the quality of teaching and research. We therefore particularly welcome employees from different backgrounds, whose perspectives and alternative ways of thinking may contribute to the diversity of our faculty.
