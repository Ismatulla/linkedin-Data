Organizational context

The Trust Fund for Victims (TFV) is the first of its kind in the global movement to end impunity and promote justice. With the adoption of the Rome Statute in 2002 and the establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC) as an independent international organisation, the international community has provided a new platform to achieve justice for the victims of the most serious crimes, namely genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and crimes of aggression.
Acknowledging the importance of victims’ assistance as part of the global justice system, the Assembly of States Parties, under Article 79 of the Rome Statute, set up the TFV. The TFV responds to the harm resulting from the crimes under the jurisdiction of the ICC by ensuring the rights of victims and their families through the provision of reparations and assistance.

The TFV is mandated by the Rome Statute, the ICC’s founding treaty, to support and implement programmes that address harms resulting from ICC crimes. It does so in two ways:

Reparations: implementing Court-ordered reparations awards against a convicted person when directed by the Court to do so.

Assistance: using voluntary contributions and private donations, to provide victims and their families in situations under Court jurisdiction with physical rehabilitation, material support, and/or psychological rehabilitation.

To implement its two-fold mandate, The TFV works closely with NGOs, community groups, women’s grassroots organisations, governments, and UN agencies at local, national, and international levels. The TFV empowers victims of crimes against humanity, war crimes, genocide and crimes of aggression and their families as main stakeholders in the process of rebuilding their lives.

With the unique roles of implementing both Court-ordered reparations and general assistance activities to victims of crimes under the ICC’s jurisdiction, the TFV works towards providing reparative value to victims and their families, and affected communities.
Duties and Responsibilities
