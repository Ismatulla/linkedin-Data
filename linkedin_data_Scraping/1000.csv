My PhD is almost finished. I will defend my PhD thesis on 23 September 2021. You can find more info here: https://www.rug.nl/news/2021/09/in-traffic-we-see-more-than-we-think

About me: Enthusiastic traffic psychologist who bridges the gap between science and practice. I am particularly interested in human factors and vehicle automation, ranging from assisted driving (ADAS) to automated driving and autonomous driving. I work on topics such as human machine interaction (HMI) and vehicle driving skill. Since 2021 I have the pleasure to work at RDW, the Dutch Vehicle Authority, as the lead on human factors and vehicle automation and to work closely together with the experts of CBR.
Previously I combined my work at the Dutch government with PhD research in the field of traffic psychology. I combine knowledge with a broad (inter)national network of human factors and traffic experts to obtain results and push forwards the safe deployment of smart mobility.

My PhD research is about information along familiar routes: on what we perceive and how this affects human behaviour. I have a specific interest in the detection of driving-related information and changes in this information, specifically concerning traffic management. If you are interested in my PhD work, you can find more info here: https://twitter.com/ilseharms/status/1438861650795405314?s=20.

Additionally, I am
- Alternate Director for the Netherlands at Euro NCAP
- Chair of the board of De VerkeersGedragDag, the leading national conference for professionals within traffic psychology - from knowledge institutes, market parties and governments - where we yearly share the state of the art in our field of work (www.devgd.nl),  
- peer reviewer for the scientific journal Transportation Research Part F, 
- a writer of scientific articles,
- sharer of research results with the general public through the media, including the NOS news on TV, radio shows on e.g. Radio538 and BNR, and various newspapers,
- and a lecturer on the full extent of traffic psychology through guest lectures and master classes for organisations and institutes such as DTV, PAO, NHL and HAN. 
The most important thing of knowledge is that is shared and applied!

She looks at the world and at organizations through the eyes of an anthropologist. Cultural anthropology is the discipline that asks what it means to be a human among humans in organisations and beyond. In 2012 she put Lewis method of Deep Democracy on the map in the Netherlands and she now works with a team of instructors to provide Deep Democracy training courses. She is always looking for ways to build strong tribes and reinforce the relationships between people. And then she brings that knowledge back to the world of organizing, cooperation and leadership through challenging keynotes and master classes. To improve the strength and results of individuals and groups (and to make the world a more beautiful place). She trains people, so that we never have to have meetings again. She takes you along in narratives that create space for new ways of seeing and new ways of dealing. Gradually, what is familiar becomes strange. And what is strange becomes familiar.

What others say about Jitske:
“Jitske Kramer is one of the best speakers of the Netherlands. She is energetic, sharp and connecting. She stimulates you to really think differently and to voice your thoughts and opinions. She talks with flair, humor and guts. Challenging the obvious. Asking questions. Seeking out for surprising new insights and practical applicability. Formal when needed, informal when possible. In short: Jitske rocks.”"

I'm a firm advocate for teacher leadership. For too long teachers (in the Netherlands) have been on the sideline and other people lacking in classroom experience have decided on and have dominated educational policy.

""Provide tailored mass spectrometry imaging solutions for product development purposes, in order to better understand product function and highlight important pathways of action.""

I established my start-up company, AKIN solutions, in order to pursue this goal.

Experience:

I successfully graduated my multidisciplinary PhD in 2018 which was focused on mass spectrometry imaging method development for analysis of advanced 3D cell culture models. Then I moved on to a role at the Leiden University Medical Center to establish tailored 3D cell culture and analytical protocols in order to address informational gaps in sarcoma research. This involved generation of patient-derived sarcoma models, the creation of suitable 3D cell culture methods within the group, and the adaptation of appropriate mass spectrometry imaging protocols for the analysis of these models. 

Funded by an EMBO fellowship I worked at the Center for Mass Spectrometry and Optical Spectroscopy (CeMOS) in Mannheim for four months (Jan-Apr 2022), in collaboration with the LUMC.

Over Tim:
Als Startup ondernemer heeft Tim verschillende bedrijven opgericht.
Het bedrijf Prindustry is vandaag de dag een marktleider in web2print software en Digital Asset Management. Tim stond aan de wieg van de webshop functionaliteiten en maakte de verbinding met de eerste 100 klanten. 

Bardoggy is een platform voor de horeca. In de tijd van lancering waren er apps als MyOrder, Scoopy en IENS die (met name gericht op restaurants) de verbinding maakte tussen bezoeker en locatie. Er was geen dominante speler specifiek voor de cafe horeca en de uitgaanssector.
Met funding (in totaal ca. 1miljoen), en een team is de MVP gelanceerd en groeide BarDoggy uit tot een app met voordeel coupons bij populaire uitgaanslocaties. Producenten sloten zich aan en konden kwalitatieve introducties van nieuwe producten aanbieden of juist bestaande producten een boost geven. 

Op het hoogtepunt zijn er 500 horeca locaties actief op BarDoggy en worden er wekelijks tienduizenden drankjes met de app aangeschaft.De conservatieve en traditionele houding van de sector maakt dat het lastig is om de meerwaarde van de consumentendata te kapitaliseren waardoor na 5 jaar een concreet verdienmodel uitblijft. De technologie is verkocht en het platform is in 2020 uit de lucht gehaald.

In commerciële rollen bij Print.com (250 FTE) en Lytho (40 FTE) is Tim verantwoordelijk voor de groei. Als teamspeler zoekt hij  graag de verbinding met collega’s om samen tot een mooi resultaat te komen. Hij geeft leiding op een mensgerichte manier en heeft focus op een goeie teamdynamiek. 

De heeft Tim ruim 50 bedrijven begeleid als startup en business coach. Daarnaast is hij spreker en geeft hij workshops over business-modelling en ScalingUp. Op strategische vlak is Tim betrokken bij talentontwikkeling, schaalbaarheid van Novel-T en de langetermijnvisie / strategie."

Amongst others, he created games in swimming pools, therapeutic sessions and forests. By creating games with professionals, students and non-game developers, Menno builds bridges between industries, disciplines and people. As a result, he fosters the inclusion of new perspectives and domains into the creative industry of game development.

Menno worked as incubation manager at Dutch Game Garden. He helped start-ups to enter the game industry or to search for new markets for their interactive experiences. Within a revamped incubation program, Menno brought start-ups together and had them learn from and with each other. In two years, the program has grown from zero to 40+ participants, all engaging and growing their businesses. 

Menno initiated the Games [4…] Jams. These game jams bring people together to develop a working game in a rather short time span. The jams produce case studies in the domains of inclusion, health, education and cultural heritage. Most of all, they inspire and connect. 

Together with Mark van Kuijk, Menno founded the game studio Lapp. Lapp develops prototypes and performs user tests for games that stimulate meaningful interactions between (grand)parents and children. Combining two playing styles and cognitive abilities in one game in order to resonate both experiences and invite players to communicate with one another.

As chairman of Games [4Diversity], Menno tries to improve the representation and inclusion of socio-cultural minorities in games. By organising gamejams, talks and informal mixers, he brings people together to inspire and connect on a rich variety of subjects. In line with this work, Menno organises the annual (Dutch) Courage showcases at GDC and Gamescom. He sets up industry meetings in Utrecht and  organised various conferences and summits. 

Currently, Menno works on games that fight cancer, artrose, loneliness and other (mental) health related subjects. All his work has one thing in common: connecting people in playful manners. "

Innovatie wordt niet gedreven door het feit of het technisch mogelijk is, maar of het waarde toevoegt voor de eindgebruikers. Kunnen en willen zij het gebruiken?

Innovatie in de zorg wordt nog te vaak ontwikkeld vanuit een ander perspectief. Kan de zorg efficiënter en goedkoper?

Mijn vrouw Hester, kreeg de diagnose Alzheimer toen ze 50 was en ruim 5 jaar later stierf ze aan de gevolgen ervan. Elke dag was ik getuige van haar oneerlijke strijd voor waardigheid en zelfredzaamheid. Als mantelzorger werd ik overbelast met het organiseren en regelen van de zorg. 

De zorg in Nederland is vastgeroest in hokjes en silo’s. Het systeem is kapot. Verandering is noodzakelijk en dan mogen we niet alleen naar anderen kijken. Wat is onze eigen rol hierin? Wat is de rol van de informele zorg in de wijk?

#focusopwatwelkan

Vanuit de praktijk zie ik kansen en mogelijkheden voor innovatie in de zorg die de positieve focus leggen op wat dus wél kan en daarin verbindend zijn. Ontwikkeld met en voor de mensen in de zorg.

Wereldwijd zijn er méér dan 60 miljoen mensen met dementie. Met mijn kennis en ervaring wijd ik mij volledig aan het welzijn voor mensen met dementie en de familie (mantelzorgers).

Op 24-jarige leeftijd word ik onterecht veroordeeld voor drugssmokkel. Ik krijg 10 jaar celstraf en beland onschuldig in een gevangenis in Marokko.

Ondanks de onterechte opsluiting en het harde gevangenisleven besluit ik er het beste van te maken. Ik relativeer, waardeer het kleine, koester wat ik heb en zet mijn verdriet, woede en frustratie om in positieve energie. Na 1637 dagen kom ik vrij: sterker, positiever en veerkrachtiger dan ooit.

Men zegt dat mijn verhaal even bizar als inspirerend is. Met mijn levensveranderende ervaring heb ik inmiddels tienduizenden mensen geraakt, ontroerd, gemotiveerd en verder geholpen in het leven.

De juiste mindset, jezelf en je medewerkers continue ontwikkelen, veerkrachtig zijn. Zodat wanneer een crisis je raakt, je terug kunt veren, het roer om kunt gooien, jezelf kunt herpakken. Ik hou ervan om mensen in organisaties rondom deze onderwerpen te inspireren en adviseren. En met inbreng van mijn eigen ervaring maak ik het persoonlijk en toegankelijk.   

2020 zou voor mij het jaar zijn geweest dat alles goed zou komen. Na een dip in 2016 waarbij ik alles bijna kwijtraakte, was ik langzaam maar zeker aan het terugkrabbelen. Ik had begin 2020 alles eindelijk weer redelijk op een rijtje, er was weer een lichtpuntje aan de horizon. Ik had een goed lopend programma bij BNR en ik kreeg zowaar een hoofdrol in “Hello Dolly” de musical naast o.a. Simone Kleinsma, iets waar wel van heb durven dromen maar nu was het werkelijkheid.
En toen kwam waar daar opeens Covid-19 dat virus wat ver weg leek maar opeens aan een ieder zijn voordeur stond te bonken.
Binnen een tijdsbestek van een paar maanden verdwenen gegarandeerde opdrachten als sneeuw voor de lentezon. Waaronder ook het schitteren in een musical met Simone Kleinsma en Paul de Leeuw en nog vele andere theatercollega’s.
Gelukkig had ik 2 jaar daarvoor besloten dat het roer om moest. Ik wilde meer doen om bedrijven te helpen met de zelfontwikkeling van hun werknemers en ondernemers helpen met mindset sessies om veerkracht te ontwikkelen. Twee onderwerpen, waarin ik mezelf ervaringsdeskundige mag noemen.
 
Ik begon met het bijspijkeren van mijn kennis op het gebied van performance management en complexe ondernemings vraagstukken tijdens de crisis. Sinds 2019 ben ik Chief Inspirational Officer binnen Lenard and Lenard. Dit nadat ik eerst zelf een periode ben bijgestaan door hen om door mijn eigen storm te varen. 
Ik ben nu inzetbaar bij bedrijven om ze positief in beweging te krijgen en ze anders naar zichzelf maar ook naar de markt te kijken. Want een ding is zeker, Covid-19 is voor ons allemaal in welke vorm dan ook een  game changer. In mijn huidige rol probeer ik ondernemers en organisaties zoveel mogelijk te laten praten over hun uitdagingen maar ook over hun kansen die deze rare periode ook met zich meebrengt. 

Kortom, met de juiste mindset geloof ik niet alleen, maar weet ik zeker dat er heel veel mogelijk is. De kunst voor organisaties is een gezonde cultuur te creëren waarin mensen makkelijk tot een positieve mindset komen. Om te inspireren en geïnspireerd te worden nog betere resultaten te behalen.  "

I advise advertising and design companies on the topic of AI and its impact on our industry. I help them implement AI to gain extra creative leverage.

Currently I am testing OpenAI's Dall•E Experimental, which is still in alpha phase, as well as the multimodal version of ChatGPT, which will generate images too. Additionally, I’m affiliated with D-ID whom I've helped conceiving their Creative Reality Studio. With Arno Coenen I founded award winning AI-art collective CØ11@BorAi+oR⚡

For design- and ad-agencies I conceived creative campaign concepts, big and long strategically and technologically powered ideas. I spark creative processes with and within creative teams and I explore how disruptive tech - like Artificial Intelligence - augments creative professionals in their creativity, reach and effectiveness.

I conceived many on/ off/ through and beyond the line ad campaigns, which I helped materialise in any way. Whatever the medium, for whenever moment in whatever funnel (I prefer Google’s model though).

On the way to DALL•E 2's beta launch, I -as part of a small group of people- tested that AI for unwanted biases through creative experimentation, conceived new relevant product concepts inspired by the AI’s capabilities and helped OpenAI find high profile Dutch creative professionals as well as renowned Dutch artists to be DALL•E 2’s first artistic ambassadors.

After DALL•E 2 was made accessible to the public, also our research phase crew of creatives were allowed monetising our historically significant creative explorations. DALL•E's launch served as blueprint launching ChatGPT, sept. '22.

Today I am testing new DALL•E version V2.Experimental, ChatGPT Multimodal and its revolutionary Plugin Store. I also help other AI developing companies such as D-ID, advice on EU vs US privacy and IP-complexity and on how to responsibly and safely integrate AI effectively into workflows.

I currently use matrix models to explore how interactions within a family network affect the dynamics of a family of social individuals and how this affects the dynamics of populations of endangered animal species. 

During my PhD I explored how plasticity in individual growth curves affect the dynamics of structured populations. To do so, I connected dynamic energy budget models to size structured population models. I used this framework to study the effect density dependent growth in harvested North Sea fish stocks.

Dr. Natasja MS de Groot and Cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. Yannick J.H.J Taverne. The institute is a fusion of their research groups, which are respectively translational electrophysiology (department of Cardiology) and translational Cardiothoracic Surgery (department of Cardiothoracic Surgery). Within this institute  an network of medical doctors, engineers, biologist, patients and companies collaborate to implement innovation in biology, technology in daily clinical practice to diagnose and treat diseases caused by bio-electrical dysfunction with emphasis on the heart.
Bioelectronic medicine encompasses innovative approaches to detect and treat diseases by utilizing bioelectricity. Bioelectricity refers to generation of electrical currents by conversion of chemical energy produced by living organisms. Bioelectrical signals are at the heart of cell-cell communication and therefore essential for organization, morphogenesis, and regeneration of cells. Bioelectrical dysfunction causes dysfunctional organs and hence a variety of challenging diseases e.g. cardiovascular, neuromuscular-, skin- neurological-, auto-immune-, psychiatric-, metabolic- diseases and cancer. Deciphering bioelectricity and subsequently modulating it, revolutionizes prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment of these diseases. Recent molecular studies have highlighted the importance of bioelectrical signaling; the electrochemical nature of cells and their micro-environments encompasses a tight coupling between cellular physiology and bioelectricity. Combined with the realization that externally applied electrical fields can modulate multicellular processes, interest in bio-electricity of biological systems has been revived. The bioelectrical system is the quintessential link between form (morphology) and function (physiology) and is the gamechanger in translational research."

I admired their dedication to improving the lives of even just a few people. Knowing how advancements in science had given me a chance to live a normal life, I decided that my goal is to do the same for other people.

Today, I am training for a career in science and in my spare time I am a passionate advocate and volunteer for the cause of making medicines accessible and affordable for everyone around the world.

In 2021, I graduated cum laude and with Honours from an interdisciplinary Bachelor's programme combining biomedicine with public health and information.

Currently, I am in the second year of a Master's in ""Cancer, Stem Cells and Developmental Biology"". I have recently completed an internship at the Hubrecht Institute in the group of Wouter de Laat. Through this internship, I explored my interest in epigenetics, and in particular the effects of alterations in the 3D genome structure in cancer. Currently, I am looking for a final six month internship. After I graduate, I hope to continue a career in cancer research, contributing towards a better understanding of the molecular and (epi)genetic underpinnings of cancer, and by extension targets for improved treatments.

When I am not working or volunteering, I enjoy reading books, letting my creativity run free through writing short stories, as well as traveling and capturing memorable moments in photographs."

He developed several cutting-edge next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based methods for the study of nucleic acid modifications (MAB-seq [5-formylcytosine/5-carboxylcytosine] and 2Ome-seq [2'-O-methylation]), and structure (CIRS-seq, SPET-seq, RAPiD-MaPseq, and multiplexed SHAPE-MaP).

For me it is important to be reliable and I will do everything to keep that reputation. I like to help others, although I am learning now not to overdo that and mark my boundaries. That matches with delivering high quality work.

In my life and work I found out that it is satifying to always have a goal and some sort of challenge. So when a job is finished I will look for another task, no matter how big or small. I see a disappointment as a chance to learm something new. It keeps me flexible, awake and optimistic.

I am happy with my part-time job as a high school teacher biology. It appears to be fitting me and I love to work with so many people. As a hobby I work with horses, and sometimes other animals. I train my own Dartmoor pony in academic dressage, driving, and allround skills. I like to train people and animals. My dream is to do this at the same time.

Besides that I feel like a real scientist. I am especially interested in animal ethology (behaviour), anatomy, physiology, and parasitology. According to me spirituality and science can exist side by side, which will bring great things in the future. 

With my own bussiness Wonderpony, where I do horse and donkey worm egg counts in dung samples, I can perform the thouroughness and science skills I like to keep up. The advising of the horse owners and the networking is one of the advantages of this part-time job.

Nature simply fascinates me. I am outside as much as I can and I like to share that with others. I use intuition a lot while working with nature or animals. It has learned me so much in the past. 

I the future I would love to stay a teacher. I would like to combine that with biology or educational research, scientific research, or other activities. Like horseback riding, animal training and care/health, working outdoors or field work, lab work or anything like this. Any job that contains the elements of my passions is interesting for me."

I found a new interest in trying to understand the mechanisms behind diseases and how you can use biology to fight them. 

My dream of becoming a scientist was shattered during my first internship. During those 6 months I came to the realization that there was no match between me and a life of pipettes, microscopes and cell cultures. 

A specialization in Science Based Business prepared me for a career outside of the scientific world and I decided to apply for a Traineeship at KPN. The same people surrounding me were surprised this time. It was hard to understand how a background in biology made sense for a career in IT and Telecommunications.
