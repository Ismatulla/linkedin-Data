Finance & Risk Trainee NN Group,"English text follows below Dutch text
Ben jij nog lang niet klaar met leren en wil jij jezelf voortdurend blijven ontwikkelen en uitdagen? Dan is het Finance & Risk Traineeship bij NN Group de perfecte start van je carrière!
Bij NN zijn wij er voor onze klanten bij grote veranderingen in hun leven. Bijvoorbeeld bij het kopen van een huis, gezinsuitbreiding of een pensioen. Als Finance & Risk trainee bij NN Group draag je dus bij aan zeken die ertoe doen en word je klaargestoomd als leider van de toekomst. Daarom zijn we opzoek naar trainees die zich inleven in onze klanten, initiatief nemen en niet snel opgeven, jou dus!
Het Programma
Onze trainees zijn onze toekomstige leiders. Tijdens het tweejarig traineeship zet je de eerste stappen in je ontwikkeling naar deze toekomst. Je doet drie opdrachten bij drie verschillende afdelingen. Eén van die opdrachten kan ook in het buitenland zijn, bijvoorbeeld in Madrid, Athene of Praag. Hierdoor leer je het hele bedrijf goed kennen, bouw je een groot netwerk op en word je op zowel inhoudelijk als persoonlijk vlak flink uitgedaagd. Na deze drie rotaties ga je aan de slag in een vaste functie.
Daarnaast neem je samen met je mede-trainees deel aan het ‘Future Leaders Programme’. Dit ontwikkeltraject draait vooral om persoonlijk leiderschap; je persoonlijke groei als professional en als toekomstig leider van NN. Naast het FLP volg je trainingen waarbij verschillende onderwerpen aan bod komen, zoals projectmanagement, stakeholdermanagement of data & AI. Om je leercurve zo steil mogelijk te maken heb je verder een senior leader als mentor en word je gecoacht door onze trainee managers.
Jouw Ontwikkeling
Door je opdrachten, het intensieve ontwikkelprogramma, je coach en mentor geven we je de tools om het verschil te maken binnen NN en jezelf snel te ontwikkelen. Je wordt continu uitgedaagd en doet in korte tijd veel kennis, ervaringen en waardevolle inzichten op. En je bent niet de enige, je doet dit samen met je mede-trainees. Aan het eind van het traineeship ben je onderdeel van een hechte groep vrienden met wie je je altijd verbonden zult voelen.
Jouw impact als trainee
Als Finance & Risk trainee werk je in een kennisrijke omgeving bij een van onze afdelingen voor Finance of Risk. Je eerste rotatie van een jaar vinden wij voor je, waarbij we kijken naar je achtergrond, je vaardigheden en je ontwikkeling. Voor je tweede en je derde opdracht van zes maanden sta je zelf aan het roer, die mag je vormgeven naar jouw interesses en leerdoelen. Je kunt werken bij een Business Unit in Nederland, bijvoorbeeld bij Pensioenen of Schade of bij een van onze expertise kantoren op het gebied van data science of actuariaat in het buitenland, maar ook bij onze merken zoals OHRA en Movir. Uiteraard kun je ook terecht op ons hoofdkantoor in Den Haag, bijvoorbeeld bij Group Risk. Je kunt dus overal in onze organisatie werken, er is geen vaste route!
Wat wel vast staat, is dat je heel veel zult leren van de expertise van je collega’s. De wereld van Finance en Risk bij een verzekeraar is zeer complex en uitdagend. Bij elke opdracht doe je weer een schat aan kennis op. Je zult flink worden uitgedaagd, heel veel leren in korte tijd en je analytische skills maximaal inzetten!
Voorbeelden van onderwerpen waar je aan zou kunnen werken zijn:
Risk management
Pricing
Data analysis
Asset and liability management
Modelling
Business intelligence
Reporting
IFRS17
Wat je meebrengt
Om een van onze toekomstige leiders te worden breng je de volgende ervaring en kwaliteiten mee:
Universitaire Master in een kwantitatief gebied (Bijvoorbeeld Finance / Econometrie / Actuarial science / Wiskunde / Natuurkunde / Quantitative finance / Economie).
Sterke communicatieve vaardigheden
Kritisch denken
Probleemoplossend vermogen
Proactiviteit
Wendbaarheid
Verder heb je een Masterdiploma of verwacht je vóór 1 september 2023 af te studeren en heb je maximaal twee jaar werkervaring vanaf je afstudeerdatum. Daarnaast spreek en schrijf je goed Engels. Jouw motivatie voor NN en het traineeship vinden we belangrijk en hoe jouw persoonlijke vaardigheden van waarde kunnen zijn voor onze klanten en NN Group.
Wat bieden wij jou?
Startsalaris van €3095,- bruto (op basis van 36 uur) en gunstige secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden
Dertiende maand en vakantiegeld bovenop je bruto salaris
Drie rotaties; je hebt de mogelijkheid om verschillende onderdelen van onze organisatie te zien (NN Group breed).
Een intensief persoonlijk ontwikkelprogramma inclusief trainingsweken, individuele coaching en mentoring en een individueel opleidingsbudget
Zichtbaarheid; tijdens het traineeship maak je kennis met senior leiders via het mentorprogramma en verschillende evenementen
