PhD position in AI Tools for Analyzing Multimodal Data in Law Enforcement,"Postdoc Position on Digitally Enforceable Data Sharing Contracts
Faculteit/Dienst: Faculteit der Natuurw., Wiskunde & Informatica
Opleidingsniveau: Gepromoveerd
Functie type: Wetenschappelijk Personeel
Sluitingsdatum: 25 juni 2023
Vacaturenummer: 11654
The University of Amsterdam (UvA) is looking for a Postdoctoral Researcher in the area of programming languages, formal methods, and distributed systems. Within the Secure Scalable Policy-enforced Distributed Data Processing (SSPDDP) project, the UvA and Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) are collaborating on the theory and design of domain-specific software languages for the high-level specification of digitally enforceable contracts, in particular data sharing agreements. Founded on legal primitives, the languages make it possible to connect the formal interpretation of legally binding contracts to the primitives of an execution environment such as the transactions on a blockchain platform and access requests in an access-control system. The goal is to enable the integration and automatic enforcement of high-level contract specification within distributed systems for data exchange and federated data processing.

The offered contract is for an initial period of 12 months. The contract is intended to be extended with an additional 24 months contingent on the pending availability of funds for the Amsterdam Data Exchange (AMdEX) initiative.

Within AMdEX, the UvA is collaborating with societal and industrial partners to develop a generic infrastructure for the exchange of data. AMdEX facilitates the bringing together of data and data analysis algorithms in ways that ensure societal regulations and sharing agreements are respected, thus delivering sovereignty to data providers and the preservation of the rights of data subject (when present). The infrastructure is leveraged by marketplaces in which data providers and algorithm providers find each other and establish sharing agreements as part of transactions. Building on data exchange archetypes and policy templates, the sharing agreements are translated into concrete applications executed on the AMdEX infrastructure. The AMdEX infrastructure is neutral with respect to the marketplaces, enabling marketplaces to provide the specific services that benefit their users.

What are you going to do?

You will perform cutting edge research on a crucial topic that directly impacts society. The objectives in this project are to:
(formally) evaluate the design and expressiveness of the eFLINT language currently used within the SSPDDP and AMdEX projects;
build on existing work to perform verification (e.g., bounded model checking) on contract specifications to verify properties and detect conflicts;
develop methods for integrating contract specifications in data exchange systems for the ex-ante and ex-post enforcement of data sharing agreements, e.g., by generating smart contracts;
investigate mechanisms for the (partially) automated auditing of data exchange systems.

Possible outcomes are: (domain-specific) software languages, system architecture designs, and prototypes for verifying contract specifications, language implementations, and auditing/monitoring components.

Tasks and responsibilities:
You will contribute to various AMdEX use-cases in which societal (public and private) partners form consortia and build innovative data exchange solutions. Topics of interests in these use-cases are third party computation and (other) compute-to-data solutions. Within these use cases, your focus will be on the enforcement of contracts and other legal requirements;
As a Postdoc you will also contribute to writing new research proposals on the topic and may have a (modest) role in student supervision.

What do you have to offer?

Your experience and profile:
A PhD degree in computer science, software engineering or a related discipline;
Demonstrable experience with (one or more of) programming languages, compilers, formal methods, distributed computing, and/or blockchain and smart contract applications;
The ability to critically analyse abstract models as well as concrete implementations;
The ability to (co-)supervise (PhD) students working on related topics;
Enthusiasm for the research process: studying research papers, solving complex problems, applying creative thinking, evaluation, reflection and disseminating findings via writing and oral presentations;
Fluency in written and spoken English.

Our offer

We offer a temporary employment contract for 38 hours per week for a period of at least 12 months. The preferred starting date is 1 August 2023 or earlier. The contract is intended to be extended with an additional 24 months, contingent on a positive evaluation and the pending availability of funds for the Amsterdam Data Exchange (AMdEX) initiative.

In this project, you will be exploring unsupervised and self-supervised learning methods. Moreover, you will have the possibility to test the results of your work with water and energy providers. This position is part of a collaboration between several industrial and academic partners.

Job Description
Predictive maintenance offers great potential value to the energy and water supply industry. Timely detection of required maintenance of machines, sensors, or other critical infrastructure can prevent service disruptions and costly loss of resources. For instance, visual sensors can be used to analyze and detect subtle patterns, and auditory sensors can pick up subtle sound changes.
Artificial intelligence allows for improved prediction performance on predictive maintenance tasks. However, one of the main challenges is dealing with real-time-based predictive maintenance. Instead of treating predictive maintenance as a simple alert monitoring, real-time-based predictive maintenance offers an estimate of time-to-failure. You will be addressing this challenge by working with large amounts of unlabeled visual and auditory datasets to create models for continuous and reliable monitoring of system states that can accurately predict time-to-failure. You will work on deep learning solutions to achieve real-time-based predictive maintenance algorithms. These models will be based on unsupervised and self-supervised learning, and you will work with both discriminative and generative models. Moreover, you will study the accuracy, reliability, and possible integration of these models with water and energy providers and other industrial partners.

Your work will contribute to achieving a more reliable distribution of energy and water and to the more general goal of building robust machine learning for a sustainable society. You will be part of the Jheronimus Academy of Data Science in ‘s-Hertogenbosch and closely collaborate with Tilburg University and the Eindhoven University of Technology.

Develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques for supporting transdisciplinary dialogue on climate risk management.
Job description
Climate changes, such as sea level rise, soil subsidence, extreme rainfall, and drought, induce new challenges and risks for real estate and infrastructures, especially in low lying urbanized deltas, as in the Netherlands. While people’s homes, communities, and livelihoods are at stake, real estate climate risks also stand to destabilize markets and society at large.
In this position, you will co-design and co-develop an Integrative Forum (IF) that aims to facilitate two-way transdisciplinary exchange and dialogue on climate risk management. The IF, on the one hand, provides a ‘soft space’ for debate and reflection between research teams, societal partners, and citizens at large. On the other hand, the dialogue in the IF provides an opportunity for innovative research on institutionalized logics, tactics, and procedures that hinder or enable effective cross-disciplinary collaboration.

An innovative aspect of this position is the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for supporting the development of the IF. AI, specifically, natural language processing (NLP), techniques can support the IF by, e.g., recognizing the stakeholders’ values and norms, identifying arguments and perspectives, identifying disagreements, finding novel viewpoints, and modelling opinion dynamics.
The data for AI techniques comes from the recordings and transcripts (obtained with appropriate permissions) of the meetings in the forum, which will be organized regularly during the project. Further, where available, we can employ discursive data outside the forum, e.g., on social and news media.
You will address the following preliminary research objectives, which will be refined by you in cooperation with your supervision team.

RO1: Generate cross-disciplinary research insights and build collective governance capacity through dialogue, reflection, and mutual learning facilitated within the Integrative Forum.
RO2: Leverage AI to draw out stakeholders’ institutionalized logics, tactics and procedures to facilitate cross-consortium reflection and learning to build collective governance capacity.
RO3: Create generalizable institutional and strategic insights about how to enable productive two-way transdisciplinary and cross-actor exchanges which build capacity for integrated climate risk management in the built environment.
This position is part of Work Package 5 (WP5) of the Real Estate Development & Building in Low Urban Environments (RED&BLUE) research initiative, a major new program funded by the Dutch Research Council. More information can be found at: www.redblueclimate.nl. In addition to you, WP5 involves a PostDoc, with whom you will closely collaborate.
As a member of the RED&BLUE team, you will do high-impact research on a pressing societal topic relevant within the Netherlands and beyond. Your research will enable you to actively collaborate with other researchers and societal partners, providing you with exceptional mentorship, personal development, and networking opportunities. You will also build upon the work of other researchers and real-world urban use cases.
Requirements
This is an interdisciplinary position. We are looking for a candidate that may fit into one of the profiles below (or a combination).

Profile 1: Holds a PhD in an Artificial Intelligence related topic and has experience or keen interest in exploring collaborative climate risk management as an application area of AI techniques. OR
Profile 2: Holds a PhD in a topic related to Climate Risk Management (e.g., real estate, spatial governance, planning or related specialisations in geography) and has experience and keen interest in exploring the application of AI techniques for climate risk management.
Have excellent scientific skills, as demonstrated by peer-reviewed publications, preferably across two or more different scientific disciplines.
Have a good command of the English language, required for scientific publishing.
Excellent communication skills and the ability to switch between operational and managerial levels within the various disciplines that are part of this research. · Team spirit and an open personality.
A good command of the Dutch language is a positive point, considering the consortium members and case studies of this research as well as the societal dissemination of your results to Dutch audiences. If the candidate does not speak Dutch, they should be willing to learn Dutch as a priority, and we expect the candidate to reach the Dutch B1/B2 language level within one year.

Conditions of employment
Depending on you knowledge and experience, a salary based on scale 10 (€ 2.960,00 - € 4.670,00) of the Collective Labor Agreement of the Dutch Universities, plus an 8% holiday allowance and an 8.3% end-of-year bonus.

Big Data Developer,"PhD Position Data-enabled systems and control co-design for large-scale wind turbines
 Apply Now
Develop data-enabled system and control co-design algorithms, synergizing control theory with novel machine learning techniques, to reinforce the performance of future-engineered systems.
Job description
In the last decades, the classical control theory has proven its effectiveness in terms of analysis and control (design) methodologies. Control theory has been a key enabler in the realization of complex systems. However, increasing system complexity leads to an increasingly indirect relationship between linear to practically meaningful performance. Moreover, the intricate requirements for system performance complicate controller design through the sole use of the classical control theory. Synergizing established fundamental control with promising data-enabled machine-learning techniques could effectively solve these present-day design challenges.

You will develop algorithms to effectuate efficient data-enabled systems and control co-design approaches. Therefore, you will tightly synergize the established control theory with novel data-enabled techniques from the fields of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). This allows for the design and efficient calibration of the system and controller in unison.

The algorithms you develop will be applied to wind turbines in simulation and experimentally on lab-scale wind tunnel set-ups. The application area is highly relevant, as wind turbines see a rapid increase in system complexity. Next-generation large-scale wind turbines are growing with increasing performance demands to satisfy the net-zero emission targets. This size increase leads to greater complexity through dynamic interactions. The exponential growth of data from wind turbines motivates the development and application of novel co-design techniques to achieve next-level performance, ultimately lowering the costs of renewable energy.
Requirements
This position is perfect for you if you possess profound knowledge of system modeling, system analysis, and (classical) control engineering, and when you have experience with or special interest in ML/AI techniques.

You will have ample space to display your auto-didactic skills and independently conduct ground-breaking research. You have a strong research-oriented attitude, good communication skills, and the ability to transfer knowledge and effectively present your challenges and results. Also, you are willing to grow as a positive (graduate) student supervisor. Working from elsewhere is permitted, however, there is a requirement to be present at least four days per week at the TU Delft faculty.

You also have:

An MSc in systems and control (control engineering), mechatronics, mechanical engineering, aeroelastics, machine learning, or a related field.

Now we’re growing faster than ever, keeping some of the world’s biggest games and WebRTC services online, and their users connected.

Job Description
Do you love to work with data, and do you get a kick out of providing valuable insights to your colleagues? Do you love to connect the dots and draw conclusions based on facts where others are just guessing? Then this might be the ideal job for you.
As a data analyst at i3D.net, there will be no typical day. We have a vast majority of datasets that are waiting to be analyzed by you. Many of them are stand alone and need to be connected to other datasets within the company to draw the right conclusions. You are deeply nested in the organization and work closely with every department to create consolidated insights that, without your gap-bridging abilities, would not have been visible to the organization. Furthermore, you are able to present your findings to the board of directors and to define and keep track of company KPI’s.

Your responsibilities:
Collect, analyze, and interpret large datasets using statistical tools and techniques.
Develop and implement data models to improve business performance.

As a data analyst, you play a vital role in the organization by helping to uncover insights and identify trends through the use of data. You have the ability to bridge the gap between different departments, helping to bring them together through the power of data-driven decision-making. Your colleagues recognize you as someone who brings joy to the often-dry world of facts and figures.
Your analytical skills are highly valued across the organization, as you are able to take complex datasets and distill them into meaningful insights that drive strategic decision-making. You have a talent for identifying patterns and trends that might otherwise go unnoticed, and your ability to interpret data in a way that is both accurate and actionable is truly remarkable.
In addition to your analytical skills, you are also an excellent communicator. You are adept at presenting your findings in a way that is easy to understand and digest, using visualizations and KPIs to help tell the story behind the data. Your presentations are well-received by colleagues from every department, and your ability to communicate the value of data-driven decision-making has earned you widespread admiration.
What do we expect from our Data Analyst?
Bachelor's degree in a relevant field, such as computer science, mathematics, statistics, or a related field.
2+ years of experience in data analysis, preferably in a business environment.
Proficiency in SQL, Python, API’s or other programming languages used in data analysis.
Experience working with data visualization tools such as Power BI.
Familiarity with statistical modeling, machine learning, and data mining techniques.
Excellent analytical and problem-solving skills.
Strong communication and collaboration skills.
Ability to work independently and in a team environment.
