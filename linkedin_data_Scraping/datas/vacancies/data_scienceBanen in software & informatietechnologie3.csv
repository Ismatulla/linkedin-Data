PhD Position Next Generation Data-Driven Aviation Environmental Footprinting,"—Dutch speaking and writing proficiency is required—

Burgers en bedrijven hebben een schat aan informatie tot hun beschikking. Die informatie wordt lang niet altijd optimaal benut, en blijft vaak zelfs onaangeraakt onder het oppervlak verborgen. In ons traineeship Data Science leer je die informatieschatten vinden, opgraven en benutten. Als trainee ontdek jij de waarde van kwantitatieve informatie en leer jij hoe je belangrijke inzichten ontvouwt uit klant- en bedrijfsinformatie.

Het ontwikkeltraject in het traineeship Data Science

Het traineeship Data Science bestaat uit drie belangrijke onderdelen:

Kennismaking met House of Bèta, collega’s en ons opleidingsaanbod tijdens de onboarding.
Waardevolle ervaring in de praktijk via opdrachten bij onze klanten.
Een opleidingstraject met aandacht voor vakinhoudelijke opleidingen (o.a. Excel/VBA, SQL en PowerBi) en vaardigheidstrainingen
De House of Beta onboarding waarin jij kennismaakt met onze organisatie. Het beste Onboarding programma van Nederland doorlopen? Er zijn meerdere startmomenten in het jaar, de eerstvolgende zijn bijvoorbeeld op 2 juni of 7 juli 2023!

Jouw ontwikkeling als trainee Data Science

Iedere consultant die bij House of Bèta start begint in de oriëntatiefase. De oriëntatiefase is een fase van ongeveer twee jaar waarin je de gelegenheid hebt te ontdekken waar je ambitie ligt en waarin jij je zou willen specialiseren. Ben jij er al zeker van dat je Data Analist wil worden? Dat klinkt goed, dan leg je in de oriëntatiefase de basis voor deze rol.

Leren in de schoolbanken is enorm kostbaar en soms is het beter om te leren in de praktijk. En dat doe je met ons traineeship Data Science. Op opdracht bij bekende klanten als ING, Achmea en PGGM ga jij jouw affiniteit met Data verder vormgeven. Dagelijks komen bij ons aanvragen binnen voor rollen als medewerker Servicedesk IT, Data Steward of Junior Data Analist. Wij matchen jou op het juiste moment in je ontwikkeling met de juiste functie.

Ben je na de eerste IT-opdrachten goed bekend met de materie en klaar voor jouw volgende stap als bèta professional? Dan groei je door richting een functie als Data Analist of Data Scientist

Opleidingen en vaardigheidstrainingen in het Traineeship Data Science

Via onze opleidingsstraat ga jij de theorie leren die nodig is voor jouw professionele ontwikkeling als IT’er. Als bèta talent haal jij verschillende certificaten in bijvoorbeeld Excel, VBA, Data Science Fundamentals en SQL. Qua vaardigheidstrainingen kun je Effectief Communiceren, en Personal Development verwachten. Een traineeship bij House of Bèta is pittig, maar leerzaam.

Job description
In the efforts towards sustainable aviation, we want to be able to maintain the societal benefits that aviation brings while reducing the negative environmental effects it has on its surroundings. To do so, we need to have ways to better understand its environmental footprint and the impact new technologies will have.

While most approaches so far primarily use models and forecasts, this project aims to utilise the increasingly available real-time information from aircraft and sensors in the surroundings of airports. Together with EUROCONTROL and 8 other European partners, which include universities, research institutes, and the industry, you will work towards innovative, real-time, data-driven monitoring approaches which will be embedded in the current regulatory models. The topic of the PhD position is the improved characterization of aircraft emissions, combining near-airport measurements, aircraft activity and performance data, together with appropriate AI methods.

The PhD position will be hosted in the Aircraft Noise and Climate Effects Section of the Department of Control and Operations of the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering. The mission of the Department of Control and Operations is to improve the safety and efficiency of operations in aerospace and to reduce the impact on the environment. The department comprises three sections: Control and Simulation, which focuses on the development of advanced automatic control systems (including the role of the human operator), Air Transport Operations, which aims to improve operational performance in terms of capacity, safety and economy, and Aircraft Noise and Climate Effects, which focuses on reducing aircraft noise, emissions and the effects of aviation on climate change and air quality.
Requirements
You should have a Master's degree in an area relevant to the subject, e.g. aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, applied mathematics/physics, atmospheric science, or other related area.
A combination of good analytical and programming skills with a strong interest in interdisciplinary work is advantageous for this position.

Doing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and a final thesis. For more details please check the Graduate Schools Admission Requirements.
Conditions of employment
Doctoral candidates will be offered a 4-year period of employment in principle, but in the form of 2 employment contracts. An initial 1,5 year contract with an official go/no go progress assessment within 15 months. Followed by an additional contract for the remaining 2,5 years assuming everything goes well and performance requirements are met.

Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities, increasing from € 2541 per month in the first year to € 3247 in the fourth year. As a PhD candidate you will be enrolled in the TU Delft Graduate School. The TU Delft Graduate School provides an inspiring research environment with an excellent team of supervisors, academic staff and a mentor. The Doctoral Education Programme is aimed at developing your transferable, discipline-related and research skills.

The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance and sport memberships, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.

PhD Position on NLP for Supporting Climate Dialogues,"Company Information
Veridis is a deep-tech startup developing a novel instrument to improve quality control in plastic recycling: MAssive DSC ANalysis (MADSCAN). This MADSCAN technology is based on Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), a thermal analysis technique. DSC can be used to analyse plastics/polymers to give a material characterisation (material type, degradation, etc.). With our MADSCAN technology we scale up the sample size of a DSC by a factor 100.000. This allows us to give a representative analysis of large batches of plastics, thereby increasing the relevance to the recycling industry. With this method we are able to analyse dark plastics, detect material degradation, and most importantly we directly increase the commercial value of recycled plastics.

Veridis has the ambitious goal to create a better future through science and technology. We are trying to create a place of work where scientists and engineers can develop technical opportunities for the benefit of society and climate. To achieve these objectives we are offering an internship with flexible working hours, an informal atmosphere, and a lot of independence and responsibility.

Assignment Description

Within this internship you will be working on a variety of problems connected to the data analysis of the proof of concept of our product. The main focus will be on research and customer driven data analysis of the thermal spectrum of polymers. The challenge can be approached from different angles: COMSOL simulation in order to better understand the system response, experimental verification of signal behaviour, data deconvolution using a mathematical model, etc. The data analysis is primarily done using Python. The assignment may also include customer interaction and collaboration.

This internship assignment will allow you to have an impact on the improvement of plastic recycling and therefore on the circular transition as a whole. Because of the multidisciplinary start-up environment you will learn a lot from different disciplines. And most importantly, you will develop your simulation and research skills a lot by working independently on a challenging project with the rest of the team to give unique insights to help you. Finally, if the internship works out well we are always interested to consider extending your stay or even taking you on board as an employee.

Intern Profile
You are a creative and curious person who is not afraid of a challenge and working with the inherent uncertainty that novel technological development brings. You like taking initiative and contributing new ideas about how to improve. Also, critical thinking and the ability to conceptually interpret thermal measurement data are required. You are able to analyse data at an academic level and are capable of communicating the results, problems and next steps clearly.

We are very flexible in time requirements; we would like to fill the internship position full time, but part time is also a possibility.

Requirements:
• Basic Python experience
Master student in Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry or similar fields.

Preferences:
• Experience in thermal physics problems
• Knowledge of numerical analysis methods is a plus
• Basic or advanced knowledge of polymer physics• Experience in writing python code in a professional manner
• Note that we can only consider students that are situated in the Netherlands during the duration of the internship. Please send your CV and list of grades to info@veridis.tech.
We are constantly improving and advancing in our theoretical research, product development, value proposition, market research, etc. Since this requires a lot of work, we are always looking for people that want to join us in our journey to a better future. Are you interested in working for us or are you looking for an internship, please contact us via info@veridis.tech.",https://media.glassdoor.com/sql/150407/delft-university-of-technology-squarelogo-1407303199964.png,Delft,€3K (Employer est.),TU Delft4.4 ★
Senior Bioinformatics Data Engineer,"PhD Position on NLP for Supporting Climate Dialogues

Develop Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for supporting transdisciplinary dialogue on climate risk management.
Job description
Climate changes, such as sea level rise, soil subsidence, extreme rainfall, and drought, induce new challenges and risks for real estate and infrastructures, especially in low lying urbanized deltas, as in the Netherlands. While people’s homes, communities, and livelihoods are at stake, real estate climate risks also stand to destabilize markets and society at large.
In this position, you will co-design and co-develop an Integrative Forum (IF) that aims to facilitate two-way transdisciplinary exchange and dialogue on climate risk management. The IF, on the one hand, provides a ‘soft space’ for debate and reflection between research teams, societal partners, and citizens at large. On the other hand, the dialogue in the IF provides an opportunity for innovative research on institutionalized logics, tactics, and procedures that hinder or enable effective cross-disciplinary collaboration.

An innovative aspect of this position is the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for supporting the development of the IF. AI, specifically, natural language processing (NLP), techniques can support the IF by, e.g., recognizing the stakeholders’ values and norms, identifying arguments and perspectives, identifying disagreements, finding novel viewpoints, and modelling opinion dynamics.
The data for AI techniques comes from the recordings and transcripts (obtained with appropriate permissions) of the meetings in the forum, which will be organized regularly during the project. Further, where available, we can employ discursive data outside the forum, e.g., on social and news media.
You will address the following preliminary research objectives, which will be refined by you in cooperation with your supervision team.

RO1: Generate cross-disciplinary research insights and build collective governance capacity through dialogue, reflection, and mutual learning facilitated within the Integrative Forum.
RO2: Leverage AI to draw out stakeholders’ institutionalized logics, tactics and procedures to facilitate cross-consortium reflection and learning to build collective governance capacity.
RO3: Create generalizable institutional and strategic insights about how to enable productive two-way transdisciplinary and cross-actor exchanges which build capacity for integrated climate risk management in the built environment.
This position is part of Work Package 5 (WP5) of the Real Estate Development & Building in Low Urban Environments (RED&BLUE) research initiative, a major new program funded by the Dutch Research Council. More information can be found at: www.redblueclimate.nl. In addition to you, WP5 involves a PostDoc, with whom you will closely collaborate.
As a member of the RED&BLUE team, you will do high-impact research on a pressing societal topic relevant within the Netherlands and beyond. Your research will enable you to actively collaborate with other researchers and societal partners, providing you with exceptional mentorship, personal development, and networking opportunities. You will also build upon the work of other researchers and real-world urban use cases.
Requirements
The candidate must have:

Completed an MSc degree in Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science, or another field relevant to the PhD topic, e.g., Spatial Planning, with completed AI, Computer Science, or related courses.
Demonstrated competence or strong interest in a relevant artificial intelligence topic such as natural language processing, social computing, or multiagent systems.
Strong programming skills.
If your native language is not English and you do not hold a degree from an institution in which English is the language of instruction, you must submit proof of English proficiency from either TOEFL (minimum total score of 100) or IELTS (minimum total score of 7.0).
Have a good command of the English language, required for scientific publishing.
Excellent communication skills and the ability to switch between operational and managerial levels within the various disciplines that are part of this research. · Team spirit and an open personality.
A good command of the Dutch language is a positive point, considering the consortium members and case studies of this research as well as the societal dissemination of your results to Dutch audiences. If the candidate does not speak Dutch, they should be willing to learn Dutch as a priority, and we expect the candidate to reach the Dutch B1/B2 language level within one year.

The internet has come to play an important role in housing search. Particularly online housing platforms have drastically changed the way in which individuals search for housing. This research project analyses buyer search and decision-making using novel big data from a large digital housing platform in the Netherlands. The use of novel big data makes it possible to empirically investigate housing search from a buyer perspective in more detail than before. It opens unique opportunities to empirically test to which extent prevailing housing search theories fit the new digital context. Importantly, the innovative nature of the big data makes it possible to relate online search behaviour to real market outcomes.
The current housing affordability issues and supply side shortages pose an important societal challenge. This innovative project provides a major contribution to the field by providing important new insights to the housing search literature and a better understanding of the housing market. The findings of the research project at the interface of housing economics and data science provide relevant societal benefits as it can contribute to market regulation, housing legislation, and housing policy.
The selected PhD candidate will have the opportunity to contribute to solutions to one of the most important current societal challenges and work on the key issues at the frontier of housing market research. The research findings based on unique big data will contribute to shaping the future research agenda and housing market policy.
The position comprises the following tasks:

Conduct innovative research on the topic of online housing search and decision making;
Write a PhD Thesis;
Publish in academic journals;
Present papers at international conferences;
Actively disseminate the research findings;

At Crunch Analytics, we help innovative fashion brands & retail organizations be fabulous! By introducing our AI-driven fashion retail platform we assist teams in making improved pricing & inventory decisions that lead to world-class profitability, efficiency & a reduced ecological footprint.

To this end, you help guide the setup of the solution, finetune it to accommodate client-specific needs, and train the client in using it. Along this journey, you act as a trusted advisor. You advise customers on some of the most challenging questions, be it tactical business decisions or design choices that influence how our technology performs.
In the said role, you work alongside other data scientists, cloud engineers, and product owners. As you mentor a client's team through unchartered territory, you share lessons learned with your squad and provide input on how to improve our solutions.

When the data connection with the client's system is set up, you import the data, interpret it, and transform it into a usable format;
You set up the data pipelines that feed the data of clients into our systems, all the while keeping an eye out for abnormalities and things that can improve;

You gain expertise in the functional domains of pricing and inventory within fashion retail by delivering the Crunch Analytics fashion platform solutions to a multitude of clients;

As clients are not always data-savvy people, they require your advice when using complex pieces of technology.

Some examples, ranging from holistic to more detailed:
What goal should I really be pursuing when setting discounts during the markdown season?
How can I determine what the residual value of products is? Can we use this knowledge to improve our current objectives?
Should I, and if so, how do I consider return costs in my discounting strategy?
Is it beneficial to differentiate my pricing or discounting strategy per shop, region, country, or continent?
How do I redistribute my inventory across stores to minimize stock-outs
More than just answering questions, you are expected to be proactive - challenging clients' beliefs if you believe they are unsound. You will become an expert, and they will need you to guide them through unfamiliar terrain.

You contribute towards continuously improving our software solution.

You feedback your experience of using the Crunch Analytics fashion retail solutions towards our Product Manager so the product can improve;
If you wish, from time to time, you will be able to roll up your sleeves and help design better algorithms or parts thereof.

You are a team player who loves to work in an agile/lean environment;
Your communication skills are on point, both written and spoken. You especially love to translate numbers into a valid storyline and help the whole room understand what you are talking about.

You will be able to work both at the office and home. Our offices in Ghent and Rotterdam are easy to reach, located in a colorful neighborhood of each city center, and close to a vast array of after-work shenanigans.

Job title
Junior Data Engineer
Location
Amsterdam, the Netherlands
About us: iconic brand, tiny company
Polaroid was founded in 1937 by one of the most seminal innovators of the 20th century, Edwin Land. His motto was, “don't undertake a project unless it is manifestly important and nearly impossible.” In 2008, Polaroid shuttered its last factory but a group of diehard fans came together as The Impossible Project to save instant film. Over 10 years later that startup acquired what was left of Polaroid and today we’re again a small group of people passionate about empowering creators to change the world in the name of Polaroid.
What we're building: tools for creators
Throughout its 80-year history, Polaroid was at its best when we made tools for people to express themselves, push boundaries and move culture forward. In the next decade, we are getting back to this purpose. We're not solving small problems, and we're not addressing a small market; our goal is to make products that will make the world more meaningful and human.
