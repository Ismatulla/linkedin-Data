Learning, experimenting, doing and experiencing is what I intend to do the coming years. I would love to come in contact with people who work on promo’s, short films, soundtracks or games.


♪ How it started?
From the moment I could walk and talk, I was singing and dancing. Fantasy and music have played a major role in my childhood. From my fourth to sixth year I attended a number of musical workshops (Utrecht Center for the Arts) and a dance school. I even got lessons from Gigi Ravelli (from GTST a dutch soap). I performed on stage.

Of course I played football, but I was more interested in planes flying over than my direct opponent. At the age of seven I played a piano piece by Bach by heart. Piano lessons were the next step; first from a music student and later from a memorable piano and singing teacher.

I learned to read notes and play classical piano. At the age of 14 I attended an improvisation workshop. Then came experimenting with music production on the computer. This experiment is now a passion and a calling. One thing led to another. For the past five years I have been producing music. Melody and chords created behind the piano. Sometimes I turn it into a piano piece. In 2018, after the 1st year, I quit my bachelor's program Game Technology at Utrecht University. Music kept tugging at me and I answered. Not so long ago (2019) I completed the Electronic Music Production Advanced course at the SAE in Amsterdam.

♪ More?
I have traveled through Europe, Australia, USA and am a (Sci-Fi, Fantasy) film geek. I am me.

WHY?

WE BELIEVE that spaces should empower the existence of people, creating spaces that inspire them, relax them, help them express, help them develop, to have fun, helping them grow, healing them.  
OUR GOAL  is to find the healthiest ways for building your life together. We want to innovate by mixing functions where we think can solve certain misbalances in society like health, behavior, challenging people to have new opportunities to rebuild their way of living. What if you build a hospital inside the zoo?   What if you build a jail inside a cathedral? How can you bring nature inside a building? Why does people heal faster when they can see the energy of the city trough the window? Can the people decide how they want to be healed and where? Where and how do they want to live their last years?  Not only in the creation of living spaces but supporting the natural impulse of finding the answers of life, meaning that we should be able to recreate what we came to do in this planet, our purpose in life. How can you support people in finding these answers? Is a space important to generate this power? Do you feel stronger in  a church? Do you feel happy in the zoo? Can you bring emotions thrue a space?
This is our dream as designers, to create vital spaces.

When I was eight years old, I started Kumon, a Japanese daily math self-study method, which I was performing during nine years until I finished it completely. It greatly aided to develop an advanced knowledge in mathematics that allowed me to place well in various math-related contests. At the age of eighteen, I managed to enter Esmuc, one of the most renowned music conservatories in Spain, while I was preparing for the university entry exams to access the mathematics degree.  Following my admission to the degree program in mathematics, I combined both studies, finishing my math degree in just four years with an average of 7.42 over 10 and my music degree in the fifth with an 8.34 over 10, receiving honors for my final thesis project, which consisted in the creation of a mathematical model to quantify the consonances, applying knowledge acquired in both careers. Furthermore, last year, I started two masters' degrees: one of them in computational engineering and mathematics and the other one in taxation. I enrolled in the second one for my personal interest in accounting, legal and financial matters. I have been studying both masters online at Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, since it provided me with the flexibility necessary to be able to combine them with the numerous rehearsal hours required to finalize my last year at the music conservatory. In the meantime, I have been tutoring a total of fifteen students, most of whom were undergraduates of engineering, mathematics, statistics or related careers.

In addition to the analytical and abstract competences granted after ending the mathematics degree, concluding the music degree has given me certain abilities, applicable when joining a team in a financial company. For instance, playing as a solo musician in a concert with an orchestra requires a great amount of self-confidence and knowing how to proceed under pressure of not failing a single note. Chamber music ensembles have taught me how to be a part of a team, learning good communication and listening skills so as to achieve a common goal, instead of simply trying to stand out individually. Lastly, I possess constancy, perseverance, concentration and initiative, which are indispensable capabilities for a musician.

I'm a 20-year-old 4th-year artist student at the University of Saxion.  In the past, I've finished one of the hardest physical and mathematical schools. Thus, thanks to my knowledge of math, especially geometry, my imagination has grown, and my ability to find solutions in tasks that require an unconventional approach.

Also, with knowledge of physics, I'm able to make my projects look more realistic.
I  also was in a class with a focus on programming, and I finished 1 year Python course. Thus, I can learn the basics of the new coding language without major difficulties

My Achievements:
So far, I've created a lot of primitive games, such as a clone of  ""Five Nights at Freddy's"", or zombie apocalypse simulator, or simple platformer.

I've created a trailer for the second game on this list.
I've made a lot of sketches, concept arts, tiles, and 2d loop animations in photoshop.

I've recently learned Maya and Substance Painter, and the basics of Unity programming. Thus I've created and textured a model of the building that was used in my new Unity 3d scene.
I've learned the basics of Ableton. Thus I took the role of the sound designer in one of my group projects, which took 1st place in the end."

analysis, probability theory, statistics and topology, and other useful skills
like computer programming (Java and C++), giving presentations and scientific
writing.

At the end of my bachelor's I learned how one can use Vim digraphs and the
XeLaTeX package unicode-math to add math symbols to documents in a more
convenient way. For instance, to add the symbol β, one normally has to type
""\beta"", but with this method one only has to enter ""b<backspace>*"" which
results in the typing of β directly in the .tex document. Then, the package
unicode-math makes sure this unicode character β is handled correctly by
XeLaTeX.  I think every mathematician should try this method.

After my bachelor's, I started the master's Mathematics, also at the Vrije
Universiteit Amsterdam. I abandoned this study in May 2017 to look for a job
as a computer programmer.

Working at Li La Land, creating innovative products to support, inspire and challenge young children to explore the world around them. Co-authored the book 'Speel je mee in Li La Land'​ together with the amazing Irma Smegen, describing 50 detailed activities combining Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math (STEAM) with language and socio-emotional development. In addition the book provides a strong theoretical basis for a comprehensive and most importantly practical approach to primary education that is truly in tune with the development of a child's young brain and mind. 

WHAT I BRING:
Thinking on how to describe my natural role within a group I came up with the word ‘Vonkeling’. Although it doesn’t exist in Dutch, I derived the word from ‘vonk’, meaning spark, making a Vonkeling ‘someone who sparks’. These sparks can be anything from new ideas and concepts, perspectives or insights, depending on what the situation asks for. Being an artist I’m able to compose stories with words or visuals that spark connections between the people involved. After all, data points and abstractly formulated values have never motivated people, but well-presented stories can push us to move mountains. This makes me a strong brainstormer and concept developer who can also bring different people together to make ideas become reality. My enthusiasm has been characterised as being 'contagious'​ and I love igniting other people's passions to strive for our shared goals.

I got fascinated by molecular neurobiology early during my bachelor Psychobiology in Amsterdam. I did a 5-month internship where I studied the learning-induced transcription factor Egr1 as possible tool for viral gene therapy for Alzheimer’s disease. To focus more on research, I chose to follow the master programme ‘Molecular and Cellular Life Sciences’ in Utrecht. I finished my first internship in electrophysiology to study the relationship between the endocannabinoid system and HCN-channels (Synaptic Physiology lab, Utrecht). My second internship was focused on studying how influenza A virus can induce CNS disease (Viroscience department, Erasmus MC). From October 2021, I started as a PhD student to study how respiratory viruses can cause CNS disease (Viroscience department, Erasmus MC).

Before coming to America I finished my high school at Amstelveen College and my first year Business Administration at the University of Amsterdam . In high school I graduated with a 3.92 GPA, putting me in the top 5% of my school. 
Besides studying I love to play soccer, this was one of the reason for me to move overseas and pursue my dreams. At 18 years old I became the starting striker of Southern Connecticut State University men's Soccer team, playing in the NE10 (NCAA DII) and having ambitions to play on an even higher level.
During high school and college I have been working part-time at different jobs (even working two jobs at the same time while being in college). Having work experience in different fields made me a very versatile person with a lot of different skills.

I have a dream!” © One famous senator.

I used to be a scientist and a teacher. I like to learn about the world and share this knowledge with others. I was doing physics and math with sparkling eyes, and society promised me a bright future. 

But the light of this spark is no match for a star — and my starlight is my passion for creating. Every time I discover an amazing new world in a game — HoMM, WoW, Witcher, Destiny, Ori, and many others  — I feel like I want to make as many awesome games as possible. That is my dream.

One day I wondered: “Why do I do my favorite activity after everyday work when I can do it all the time?” Since then I’ve been in the gaming industry for over 5 years I have discovered the following about myself.

My scientific background and hobbies allow me to combine complex activities:
- Math and art  — I can create advanced monetization and game balance models as well as drive my creative ideas to delivery
- Narrative and game design  — I can develop innovative features and memorable narrative content
- Old and new game design schools  — I can work with different types of target audience.

I educate, refine and drive myself to be a better person:
- I am constantly learning because I never settle
- I stay calm when faced with adversity
- I focus heavily on results but also enjoy the process.

People love working with me because:
- I am patient, polite, and considerate with solid teamwork skills
- I am generous when it comes to sharing experiences
- I enjoy learning as well as teaching and mentoring.

I am great at social connections, teamwork, and strategy-making. In my opinion, it’s essential because great achievements are made in close-knit teams. I am happy to share my knowledge and become a part of a new team. Feel free to contact me."

I work to captivate and engage an audience with the insights that the data reveals. To convince them of the lessons hidden within the numbers. To take readers along on a journey told through the lens of data.

In 2016 I was chosen as Rising Star and in 2017 I became Best Individual in the Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards. I’ve worked with small start-ups, magazines like Scientific American, all the way to global multinationals such as Google to help them get the most out of their data. And this can be done through both static or interactive visualizations, for online or print. So long as there’s data that has a story to reveal.

For each project I design my visualizations completely custom build. Starting from the actual data & goals, not the “available charts”. Resulting in engaging, beautiful and effective visualizations of your data. And taking the creativity one step further, I also love to turn numbers into data art or branding material, since your company’s data is inherently unique. Something that entices the eye first and foremost while still hinting at patterns found in the data.

I can take on the entire data visualization process. From data analysis, to design, to creating the final stand-alone piece. But I can also focus only on the design of the visualization an afterwards act as an advisor to your own front-end developers or analysts. Get in touch to discuss what works best for you!

Over Tim:
Als Startup ondernemer heeft Tim verschillende bedrijven opgericht.
Het bedrijf Prindustry is vandaag de dag een marktleider in web2print software en Digital Asset Management. Tim stond aan de wieg van de webshop functionaliteiten en maakte de verbinding met de eerste 100 klanten. 

Bardoggy is een platform voor de horeca. In de tijd van lancering waren er apps als MyOrder, Scoopy en IENS die (met name gericht op restaurants) de verbinding maakte tussen bezoeker en locatie. Er was geen dominante speler specifiek voor de cafe horeca en de uitgaanssector.
Met funding (in totaal ca. 1miljoen), en een team is de MVP gelanceerd en groeide BarDoggy uit tot een app met voordeel coupons bij populaire uitgaanslocaties. Producenten sloten zich aan en konden kwalitatieve introducties van nieuwe producten aanbieden of juist bestaande producten een boost geven. 

Op het hoogtepunt zijn er 500 horeca locaties actief op BarDoggy en worden er wekelijks tienduizenden drankjes met de app aangeschaft.De conservatieve en traditionele houding van de sector maakt dat het lastig is om de meerwaarde van de consumentendata te kapitaliseren waardoor na 5 jaar een concreet verdienmodel uitblijft. De technologie is verkocht en het platform is in 2020 uit de lucht gehaald.

In commerciële rollen bij Print.com (250 FTE) en Lytho (40 FTE) is Tim verantwoordelijk voor de groei. Als teamspeler zoekt hij  graag de verbinding met collega’s om samen tot een mooi resultaat te komen. Hij geeft leiding op een mensgerichte manier en heeft focus op een goeie teamdynamiek. 

De heeft Tim ruim 50 bedrijven begeleid als startup en business coach. Daarnaast is hij spreker en geeft hij workshops over business-modelling en ScalingUp. Op strategische vlak is Tim betrokken bij talentontwikkeling, schaalbaarheid van Novel-T en de langetermijnvisie / strategie."

""Healthcare consumption by ethnic minority people in their country of origin: threatening or complementary?""

Currently, about 12% (2 million people) of the Dutch general population is of non-western ethnic origin. More than half of the Turkish and Moroccan migrants aged 55 or older make use of healthcare in their country of origin, partially because of lack of trust in the Dutch healthcare system. Dutch healthcare professionals and insurance companies are confronted with the consequences of healthcare consumption in the country of origin in terms of additional consultations, diagnostics, treatments, and costs upon return in the Netherlands. However, healthcare consumption in the country of origin cannot automatically be deemed as inappropriate. It can be a necessary continuation of healthcare in the Netherlands, or be associated with acute disease. Ideally, the quality of continued chronic care and medically appropriate acute care in the country of origin is similar or better to the Netherlands, whereas inappropriate healthcare consumption in the country of origin is avoided. 
In this, first of its kind, proposed study, I will analyse size, reasons, and appropriateness of healthcare consumption in the country of origin by ethnic minority groups. I will make use of unique complementary data sources: the HELIUS cohort and the Achmea Health Database. The results will provide health policy makers, insurance companies and healthcare professionals with essential knowledge to develop effective strategies to prevent overconsumption and to improve the cultural competence of healthcare provision in the Netherlands.

My sharp eye for the abstract and the practical, helps me transform complex challenges into new solutions. With my enthusiasm and curiosity I get others on board and continue learning. 

After a career in academia, setting up innovative collaborations bridging research and practice, I fell in love with the dynamism and potential of the wider startup ecosystem. I fully enjoy helping the next generation of start-ups and scale-ups achieve their wildest dreams of making a positive societal impact with their venture.

However, to truly reach the scale of the transformation needed to address our most pressing societal challenges, we need more than impact scale-ups alone. We need governments, industry incumbents, knowledge institutes AND the next generation of startups to collaborate on developing and scaling new ways of working. 

🏗️ As senior program manager at TKI Bouw en Techniek I orchestrate collaboration between this full spectrum of partners in order to learn and innovate our way towards a CO2 free and future proof built environment. 

🌱On the side, as an independent consultant, facilitator and speaker at Havermans Consultancy and Scaling with Impact I enable collaborative learning about organizing and support impact scale-ups.

Na 7 jaar als radioloog te hebben gewerkt en dit gecombineerd te hebben met andere ambities richt ik me nu op het samenbrengen van leiderschapsontwikkeling en  HR in de zorg en combineer ik dit in recente projecten met AI (Artificiële intelligentie) omdat ik ervan overtuigd ben dat iedereen nu toch echt minimaal een beetje notie zal moeten krijgen van AI. 

Misschien bent u arts en kent u mij als maker van de Medisch Contact podcast “Beter worden met Roos&Rozie”
Wij geven geaccrediteerde nascholing voor artsen die grip willen krijgen op de manier waarop zij werken. Dit doen wij in de vorm van masterclass persoonlijk leiderschap en de masterclass medisch management.

Voor meer informatie: over key notes door mij of masterclasses door Roos&Rozie: zie www.roosenrozie.nl of mail naar sietske@roosenrozie.nl

Op welke manier kunnen we en moeten we zorgprofessionals voorbereiden op de toekomstige en huidige ontwikkelingen en veranderingen in de zorg? En denk daarbij ook aan een werkomgeving waarin Artificial Intelligence toegepast zal worden. 
Wat is daarbij nodig? Dat is mijn favoriete vraagstuk. 
Omdat ik onder andere gefascineerd ben door het onderwerp “medisch leiderschap” in het kader van zorginnovatie is het voor jou als lezer van deze informatie belangrijk om te weten wat Leiderschap voor mij betekent: “Empowering everyone around you” en daarbij is een leider voor mij “anyone who takes responsibility for recognizing the potential in people and ideas, and has the courage to develop that potential.”

Mijn kracht ligt in het verbinden van medische vakinhoudelijke vaardigheden met de overige vaardigheden die wij als zorgprofessionals in de zeer nabije toekomst of nu al nodig hebben. 
Denk daarbij aan opleiden van zorgprofessionals mbt discipline overstijgend onderwijs, met als thema’s als innovatie, samenwerken in een netwerk, digitalisering, data science (AI), diversiteit, cultuur op de werkvloer, leiderschap, zichtbaarheid, etc. 
U kunt mij inzetten als verbinder, adviseur, spreker, trainer, moderator, dagvoorzitter en podcastmaker.

After graduation he started as a freelance designer. In 1992, he was one of the founders of Fabrique in Delft, which positioned itself as a multidisciplinary design bureau. He established the interactive media department in 1994, focusing primarily on developing websites for the World Wide Web - brand new at that time. 
Under Jeroen's joint leadership, Fabrique has grown through the years into a multifaceted design agency. It currently employs a staff of more than 100 artists, engineers and storytellers working for a wide range of customers: from supermarket chain Albert Heijn to the Rijksmuseum.
Fabrique develops visions, helps its clients think about strategies, branding and innovation and realises designs. Preferably cutting straight through the design disciplines, so that the traditional borders between graphic design, industrial design, spatial design and interactive media are sometimes barely recognisable. In Fabrique's vision, this will be the only way to create apparently simple solutions for complex and relevant issues in future. 
In recent years, the agency has won more than 130 prizes and nominations in the Netherlands and abroad. Fabrique also opened offices in Amsterdam in February 2007 and in Rotterdam in 2012.
Jeroen is currently innovation strategist and founding partner. He is as a strategist and concept developer closely involved in various projects including ones for the Design Museum in London, Schiphol Airport, the City of Agra (India) and the Dutch Design Week. 
Between 2015 and 2021 he was a full professor of concept design at the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering / Delft University of Technology.

• Developing a failure-themed academic planner that leverages the symbol of a Flight Data Recorder and challenges students to assume the role of an accident investigator in their own academic journey

• Re-framing the emergency online education period necessitated by COVID-19 as a manned mission to Mars where factors such as remote learning/communication, effects of isolation, and dealing with technical issues could be openly examined

I can still remember it vividly. Looking back, I find that these bike rides are among my happiest memories.

This privilege I had as a kid, enjoying nature, has evolved into the core of my mindset as an entrepreneur and an executive. My business ventures and corporate positions reflect both a sense of purpose in wanting to do good, as well as creating an environment for others to thrive.

I like to think critically, challenge the status quo, and rock the boat a bit whenever I see potential opportunities by doing so. I strive to empower and support talented people to do the same, and want to create an environment in which they can. In my view, all employees truly are stakeholders too, and I find that often the most valuable insights about a company are found when an executive has their boots firmly on the ground.

At the crossroads of these views on business I found myself coaching over 200 start-ups, most of them involved in clean energy, at the campus of my alma mater TU Delft. Later I founded Black Bear Carbon, which pioneered in bringing the circular economy to the tire industry. In my role as CEO I was invited to join the supervisory board of Circle Economy. My decision to make room for a new executive team at Black Bear coincided quite strikingly with the position of CEO at Circle Economy becoming vacant. When I was asked by the board to step in, I felt it was my duty to do so.

At Circle Economy I feel lucky to work closely with bright, talented and deeply motivated people towards a shared goal of making the world more circular. Creating an environment for them to thrive and develop themselves and also learn new things myself everyday, my current role feels like the culmination of every step previously mentioned.

Hieraan zijn geen kosten verbonden.

From 2008, Jurgen wrote a popular blog at NOOP.NL with ideas on agile management and organizational change. He is the author of the best-selling book Management 3.0, which describes the role of the manager in agile organizations; How to Change the World, which describes a supermodel for change management; Managing for Happiness, which offers you practical ideas to engage workers, improve work, and delight clients; and Startup, Scaleup, Screwup, which dives into the major topics that business leaders and entrepreneurs are confronted with throughout the business lifecycle. And the fifth book he is working will be Glitches of Gods ... a sci-fi novel!

Jurgen can help you upgrade your organizational structure with more engagement and faster results; He can show you how to increase your business agility with faster product development; He shows you how to creatively manage your company; And he can inspire creative professionals with a purpose, helping them integrate work and more joyful living.
