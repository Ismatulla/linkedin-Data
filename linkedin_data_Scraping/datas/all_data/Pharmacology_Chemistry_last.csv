Job description
Adequate development and function of the placenta are essential for a healthy pregnancy and especially for fetal development. Indeed, impaired placental development affects placental vascular perfusion leading to severe diseases, such as fetal growth restriction and preeclampsia. These diseases cannot be treated yet, often forcing physicians to initiate premature delivery with many short- and long-term risks for both mother and infant.

At the Erasmus MC Placenta Lab we believe that the placenta provides a unique opportunity to treat pregnancy disorders that are associated with its dysfunction. For this we combine knowledge from multiple fields including physiology, molecular biology and pharmacology. We develop new breakthrough diagnostic and therapeutic strategies to cure placenta-related disorders and to even allow targeting fetal diseases before birth. The placenta has been undervalued for a long time, however, it is mainly made up of vascular trees that are of fetal origin. After delivery, the placenta thus allows us to gain insight into placental and fetal vascular development and physiology.

The aim of your PhD project is to better understand the regulators of placental vascular function and the associated alterations in placenta-related disorders in order to identify new therapeutic targets. The location of our Placenta Lab within the largest children’s hospital of the Netherlands will enable you to collect placentas from both healthy as well as diseased patients, who you approach for informed consent yourself. Using these real-life human tissues, you will perform research and apply unique models to study placental physiology and pharmacology. This includes the ex vivo dual-sided placenta perfusion model, wire myography, pressure myography, placental explants, primary cell culture and numerous molecular assays. You will do this in a multi-disciplinary environment, closely collaborating with fundamental scientists including pharmacologists and biologists, as well as clinicians from the fields of obstetrics and neonatology.
Work environment
Work environment
The placenta lab is a multidisciplinary collaboration between fundamental (pharmacology) and clinical (obstetrics and neonatology) departments within the Erasmus MC. This set-up provides the unique opportunity to perform translational research using human biological material, not only from healthy pregnancies, but even more importantly, also from pathological pregnancies. The close collaboration between fundamental scientists and clinicians allows us to work on and eventually answer questions that directly arise from the clinical field, with the ultimate purpose to improve the well-being of pregnant women and their children.
Qualifications and skills
Qualifications and skills
The candidate finished a Master in Biomedical Sciences, (Medical) Biology, Pharmaceutical Sciences, Medicine or a related Masters background
The candidate has a strong and enthusiastic motivation for a PhD track that combines fundamental and translational research
The candidate has research experience with molecular and/or cell biology as well as biostatistics
The candidate has affinity with the fields of physiology, pharmacology, and molecular biology
The candidate has fluent English language proficiency and excellent writing skills (Dutch communication is considered a strong point)
The candidate has a positive work attitude, and is able to work independently as well as in a team

Before you apply please check our conditions for employment.
Terms of employment
Terms of employment
You will receive a temporary position for 4 years. The gross monthly salary is € 2.789,- in the 1st year and increases to € 3.536,- in the 4th year (scale OIO).
Excellent fringe benefits, such as a 13th month that is already paid out in November and a individual travel expense package.
Pension insurance with ABP. We take care of approximately 2/3 of the monthly contribution.
Special benefits, such as a incompany physiotherapist and bicycle repairer. And there is also a gym where you can work on your fitness after work.
