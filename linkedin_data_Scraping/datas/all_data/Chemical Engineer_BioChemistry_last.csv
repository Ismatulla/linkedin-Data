If you feel you get energy from EHS and are ready for a new challenge, here’s your chance!

EHS&S Department at Janssen Biologics Leiden
The EHS Department at Janssen Biologics leads the implementation of the J&J World Wide EHS Standards, the ISO14001 and the OHSAS18001 (to become ISO45001) Management System standards. We work in a close collaboration with the J&J EHS organization in the Netherlands and align with the J&J organizations outside the Netherlands.
Management of EHS is a core responsibility of the entire Janssen Biologics organization where we as EHS department support by having a strong relationship with departmental EHS Representatives, Management System Standards Owners / Subject Matter Experts and Site Management.

Experience with Industrial Hygiene can lead to preference
You are driven to search for practical EHS solutions which are compliant with legislation and J&J Standards. This with close interaction with other experts within the company. You are only satisfied when improvements are sustainable. You have a 'can do' mentality and see improving the EHS performance as a collective responsibility. You focus only on short term fixes when really needed because you prefer to focus on long term solutions while you coach others to do the same.",https://media.glassdoor.com/sql/364/johnson-and-johnson-squarelogo-1654595959720.png,Leiden,nan,Johnson & Johnson,"['Was a good company when I first started and the experience is differentiated based on who your direct manager and team are. Benefits were decent, most people are nice, and lots of smart people to work with.', ""The hiring process was not too painful Decent shot at work+life balance -- there are lots of people who essentially do one thing and seem to have a healthy amount of down time Excellent internal employee support (Global Services, Benefits hotline, IT, established processes for everything you could ever imagine) 401k match exists - 75% match of up to 6% base salary (3 year vest is a big asterisk) Company culture is pretty healthy, if siloed. There is definitely an emphasis on culture fit during hiring, and there were fewer jerks than at any place I've worked. The credo is alive in lower level employees. It is dead and rotting in senior leadership. If your role isn't working for you, you can transfer pretty easily, or otherwise find a new role internally without much hassle or drama."", 'Purpose of the company (Credo) is very meaningful and motivating factor to work @ J&J Work life balance is good Culture is very good as well', '- amazing talented colleagues - great benefits -different development opportunities', 'Work life balance, skip level meetings, support from all levels for advancement', ""What a great company. Excellent health care benefits as you would expect from a pharmaceutical company and management really is there to help the employees. The training programs that they have are the best that I've ever seen and the employees that are here are really smart and happy to be working for the company. It's just such a good environment to work in."", 'Good Benefits & Compensation _ diversity', 'Super supportive teams, brand name can carry your resume heavy, huge corporations']","['New CEO and senior leadership are out of touch - demanding longer work hours, unwilling to adjust pay to fair market conditions, and reducing bonus while they sit in their ivory tower with millions of dollars in bonus after quietly laying off large portions of the workforce. The last soul of what J&J used to be died when our CMO left and with him, many executives have left as well. Paraphrasing from a townhall, executive leadership accuses employees are working longer hours because they are working from home and are not as productive. Advancement is based off of who you know and the color of your skin even though J&J tries to create optics that they care about DEI. Employees are criminally underpaid and they pride themselves in squishing levels. This is an empty shell of a company and no longer is a good place to work.', 'Compensation and benefits, pt. 1: Cash compensation (base + bonus) is mediocre, and equity compensation is absolutely dismal. Most employees - and everyone at the individual contributor level - are simply not eligible for long term incentives like RSUs. Virtually the only people getting long term incentives are Director level or higher. In the middle management levels, you are only eligible for equity if you have an exceptional performance review, which they force-distribute at less than 5%. Since stack ranking, forced performance distributions and concrete budgets are used, your boss almost has to be a jerk to get equity to anyone actually doing work; an excellent review must be balanced by a bad review. Compensation and benefits, pt 2: Health insurance is embarrassing for a company working in healthcare that, depending on the day and the stock price, could be the single most valuable healthcare company in the world. Employer only pays 68% of costs, and they use Aetna, which is in a constant battle with United for worst healthcare network in the country. The only saving grace is they have a Kaiser HMO option for folks in California, so you can avoid having the absolute worst provider. Compensation and benefits, pt 3: There is a pension program, but I couldn\'t even list it in the Pros. I did the math once, and, basically, it\'s like if you took a single year\'s raise (~4% of base salary), and invested it in a conservatively weighted / borderline poor performing 401k. You only get this benefit if you stay with the company 5 years, so at best, this benefit is like getting a bonus cost-of-living raise once you hit the 5 year mark. I think a much higher impact on potential job candidates would be to offer 4% higher base salaries and just scrap this program. Compensation and benefits, pt 4: Parental leave is generous, and the fringe benefits are competitive -- think tuition/home exercise reimbursements, the little \'thank you\' awards you can use to buy gift cards or a toaster -- stuff like that. The internal education platform is also actually useful and worthwhile to use in your free time. Compensation and benefits, pt 5: The 3 year vest on 401k company matches is ostensibly in place to incentivize people to stay, but you don\'t have a policy that vests the people who were laid off before 3 years, even if they were caught up in broad, sweeping, non-performance-related layoffs. You\'re basically stealing benefit money from your employees when you do this, and it\'s shameful. Compensation and benefits, pt 6 (final): As a result of this overall approach to compensation & benefits, you often find people working here who are either phoning it in, playing it ultra safe, or are a little...behind in their careers. I\'d like to point out how I haven\'t just said ""management bad"" here. It\'s everyone, the level 20s, the level 30s, and everyone in leadership. I\'m sorry to everyone reading this currently at J&J, but, come on: you know it\'s true. The only reason I took this job is because I wanted something stable as I have kids. The Credo: Unfortunately, J&J can\'t just be a company, they have to be one of the \'good ones,\' and they have this credo which you can google in 2 seconds that explains how they\'re going to try and be good. It\'s like a more longwinded \'don\'t be evil.\' In the past, this meant that J&J thought a bit more long term, valued employee retention, and hesitated to do layoffs. The J&J I work at, however, is just like the rest of the corporate mob. Layoffs are a constant threat and short term shareholder value is prioritized above all else.', ""Given its a big company, its bit slow in terms of execution on key initiatives. Also being in healthcare industry, the release cycles are slow (4 to 5 years) as everything has to account for proper validation, testing, auditing, compliance, security and more importantly prepare for FDA approval. Don't expect to be a fast paced work environment."", '- difficult to influence -rigid not under friendly systems and processes', 'In office 3 days a wekk', ""Can't think of any cons. It's just really a good company to work for. They get the best talent in the industry and just let them go and do their thing. I haven't seen anybody that does any kind of micromanaging or anything like that, so it's just really nice to be at a company that allows you to be yourself!"", 'Nothing at this moment for the cons to work at J&J', 'Slow because of size, constant restructuring, the work can feel like busy work.']"
