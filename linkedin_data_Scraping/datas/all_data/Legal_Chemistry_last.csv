ASML provides all that. ASML shows autonomy by letting employees do remote work (if applicable). The work is complex and interesting by it's very nature - we are building highly complicated machines. Lastly, ASML provides reward for good effort in numerous ways, such as the reward programs (points which can be converted into gift cards), salary raises that go beyond inflation, etc. As an engineer or scientist, if you develop an experiment or test plan and need money, there's very little pushback for ordering equipment or tests. And, ASML is fond of letting engineers and scientists stay as engineers or scientists - it's the managers deal with the political conversations such as headcount, budgeting, etc. Engineers and scientists can stay technical without wearing many hats. Lastly, ASML company culture is very family friendly. Managers and co-workers are very understanding when time is needed for doctors appointments, or if childcare falls through, etc."", 'Overall this is a good company to work for, even if it occasionally falls short of its stated values. -Pay is decent for early career in mechanical development. -Says all the right things about work-life balance -3 weeks PTO plus 13 paid holidays (if hired directly) (4wks PTO after 4yrs) -Funding is typically not a barrier (or a consideration) to completing my projects, but I understand that this varies between different parts of the company. -Coworkers are pleasant -Current WFH policy is reasonable. -Stable company with long-term growth mindset.

There is nothing else you will get out of this company that other employers would value more. Now you have to put your time to get to more senior positions (years, literally) and while the money is not bad, it is not at par with the industry. So the balance you gotta make is if that job safety is worth stalling your career and your income for 5 to 10 years until somebody retires. The game most people play is to get to the next 'Job Grade' (like if that is relevant anywhere else out there), which takes effort and politics. If you are lucky and get that new Job Grade, then you realize the salary bump is literally a joke, however you still won't be layed off in the coming 5 years. It is a very personal decision."", '-Some of the software tooling is somewhat dated, but this is currently evolving']"
