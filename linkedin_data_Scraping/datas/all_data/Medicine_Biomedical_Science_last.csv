PhD Position on the professional, managerial, and organizational factors involved in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare & policy
Do you have a background in public administration, policy sciences and affinity with digitalization in healthcare? And are you interested in doing PhD research? The Institute of Public Administration of Leiden University is looking for a PhD candidate to empirically study the antecedents and effects of the various gains that AI-based tools and methods may bring to the medical practice. It employs social science research utilizing a mixed-methods approach (qualitative interviews, observations, diary studies, and field experiments).
The position is part of an interdisciplinary lab, within which this position will look at the integration of the Lab’s AI tools and methods into professional, managerial, and organizational practices in hospitals. In so doing, it also aims to have impact on the medical sector and health policy more broadly. Here, questions of efficacy and efficiency gains, effective management of new or adjusted practices, and acceptance and legitimacy are interlinked. This PhD project focuses on the interface between digitalization and management science, contributing to an understanding of the professional and organizational aspects of trustworthy AI.
You will be part of one of the 17 new ICAI labs, named AI4MRI consisting of 5 PhD students, who will collaborate on making MRIs faster, cheaper, and better. The lab is an ongoing collaboration between LUMC, Leiden University and Philips. You will work closely with four PhD candidates at Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC), whilst being part of Leiden’s Public Administration Institute.
This lab is part of the 10-year LTP ROBUST program “Trustworthy AI-based Systems for Sustainable Growth” consortium, which unites 17 knowledge institutions, 19 participating industry sponsors and 15 civil-social organisations from across the Netherlands. You will gain valuable experience working with an industry partner, and will be able to tap into a wealth of networking, career development, and training opportunities in conjunction withICAI, the Innovation Center for Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam.

SAILS: The future of AI is human
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related technologies are playing an increasingly important role in our society. At Leiden University we are convinced that the future of AI is human: to create AI for Good we need to combine the expertise from researchers in AI techniques with the human aspects of AI, involving law, language, psychology, and many other fields. To this end Leiden University has started a university wide initiative called SAILS (Social Sciences, Humanities, Law, Artificial Intelligence and Life Sciences) to enable collaboration on the development and application of AI. By building on and expanding the already existing expertise of AI, we advance science and improve the quality of life for all.

Location: AMSTERDAM

FTE: 0.8 - 1
Job description
Algorithms are pervading society at a rapid pace. They are used in a variety of contexts, ranging from the replacement of certain tasks humans prefer to offload or cannot handle at large scale, to systems that support or advise humans. With the advent of these systems, their downsides also become more and more prominent. Systems that do not treat certain groups fairly and include biases, for example, have a huge impact on society. We are looking for an associate professor that focuses on algorithmic solutions for these problems. Examples of such adaptive, responsible and explainable AI may include learning bias-free models from biased data, evaluation approaches to estimate algorithmic fairness, formal norms and constraints on algorithms to guarantee fair treatment, culturally inclusive- and socially-aware AI, or explainable AI methods, as well as other relevant algorithmic approaches and solutions.
We are looking for a colleague who is a leader in the field, and can contribute to a stream of high quality publications in this area, acquire external research grants, conduct excellent teaching, and act as a bridge builder to other research groups in the Department. The position involves setting up and leading a research group in this area.

The job profile is based on the university job ranking system and is vacant for at least 0.8 FTE.
We offer a Tenure Track/Career Track position at the level of Associate Professor.

This is a career track position; the initial appointment will be for a period of 1.5 years, which will be turned into a tenured position after the initial period when the performance indicators agreed at the start of the appointment are met.
