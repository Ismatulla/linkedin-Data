Few of the employees are good people and this is pros for them not for the company.', 'I worked at Undutchables for 2.5 years and it was a very good experience. The office is centrally located in Amsterdam. The team is small so you get to know everyone very quickly.  The atmosphere at the office was always pleasant and colleagues were always open to help each other. We worked with team targets as opposed to individual targets, so it really felt like we were all working together for a common goal. The company also organised regular trainings to help employees improve their skills. The working hours were regular from 9am to 5.30 pm, and even though I would sometimes stay a little longer during busy periods of the year, it is by no means a company where you do a lot of over-hours. Very good work-life balance and good conditions in terms of holiday days etc.', 'I like the people who work for Undutchables the most. There are small teams in different offices but everyone works together to help internationals find their dream job. The teams get along and regularly go out for drinks after work. The management organizes different events throughout the year for the whole Undutchables team so all employees see each other multiple times a year. Everyone has lunch together and the managers stimulate you to go out for a walk before getting back to work afterwards.', 'Undtuchables has a great atmosphere as it is informal and the employees are very warm and welcoming. The small teams ensure that you get to know your team very well and can rely on them. I liked the fact that there was no strong hierarchy and it was possible to give feedback and input when I wanted to. There are after work drinks, team building sessions and (candidate) events which also add an extra element of fun to the work.']","['Due to the recruitment field and the size of the company there are unfortuntely not a lot of possibilities to grow into another position or in another field.\r\n\r\nHowever if you are passionate about recruitment and would like to stay in this field, its the right place for you.', 'Flat organization, so vertical growth is not as common.', ""Some roles can be contract based for a long time before the company then takes you on as an employee, but that's not a negative of UnDutchables, this is more a system that's in place across the Netherlands unfortunately."", 'None, nada, rien, nothing, I still need a fifth word....', 'I was employed by them for a large client from overseas. Unaware of the market rates here in Netherland I trusted them but when I found our they were taking more than 40% cut I was furious. I explored more and this was their business model to hire expats at extremely low hourly rates. My advise to you is to research well enough before signing a contact with them. Also, they are not helpful and cooperative unlike so many other agencies I know now.', 'Undutchables is a very stable environment and since the offices are small there is not often opportunity to make career steps upwards. So if you are someone who is looking to make quick steps, it might not be the right place. That being said, if you are more interested in finding a company that offers you a lot of long-term stability and a job where you can learn a lot then it is a great place to be at.', 'There are no big things that bother me. If you want to make quick career steps as a recruiter this might not be the place for you. However, I am an Office Assistant and Undutchables gave me the opportunity to expand my tasks by supporting the marketing team which made my job much more diverse and challenging.', 'The growth possibilities are limited.

"English speaking Senior Internal Auditor / IA Manager - Remote, with travel","*Fully remote working, flexible opportunity, working for one of Europe's 'best companies to work for’*

The business has grown rapidly in size recently and the company is looking to build out its Internal Audit (IA) team too. Given their footprint, they have stated that their internal auditors can be based wherever they choose within their European footprint (your choice!) – meaning the role is truly remote, but with the backing of a great team spread all over the globe.

Given the autonomous nature of this business and department, the team between them, will do on average around 20-30% travel, to field /office locations all around the globe in order to perform audits. The team can share the work between them to make it work for everyone.

Reporting directly to the Director of Audit and with the guidance of the other team members, the purpose of this role is to provide assurance to the Senior Management and the Board by delivering the internal audit plan. With regular contact with Finance Directors, communication and management skills are success of this position. You will be regularly interacting with stakeholders at Operational & Finance Director level to help ensure the audit work carried out adequately addresses the key risks in the Group.

We are looking for the future leaders of this business (the last 3 people we placed into this team are now Divisional CFOs/FDs, promoted after 2-3 years, respectively) and our client is very open minded on who they employ, and so are we. That being said, the successful candidate is likely to have a relevant degree (Accounting, Business, Finance, etc.) and some experience working in internal or external audit. The business language is English, so you will need to be fluent. Most importantly though, you will have a great personality, communications skills, personal standards and ethics. You need to be someone who demonstrates leadership and relationship building qualities in all that they do; and someone who anticipates problems and pro-actively seeks solutions.


Since this is a highly progressive position, in a high-performing team, the successful applicant will receive encouragement to take on more responsibility once established in the role and within the team and will be encouraged to develop into a (typically Finance/IA Director within 2/3 years) as soon as possible, within an exciting work environment, possibly internationally if desired.

If you are interested in developing your career in a large, growing business, where you are fully in control of your work-life balance, and your further career, please do get in touch.

Once they’ve done this, they will do everything they can to get rid of anyone in NA, because we cost to much. I was making 13 an hour as a NA agent. They will have you work just below full time, so they don’t have to give benefits. If you absolutely need a job, it’s money and it’s enjoyable work for a while, but I wouldn’t recommend working here long term.', 'Literally everything else and that is just sad.

You are there to generate profit, and anything else that they tell you is a straight-up lie.\r\n\r\nAs an agent, you\'re expendable, you\'re replaceable, you\'re a number, that\'s all you are. They hire people and let people go on a monthly basis. They change your shift with a few weeks\' notice because ""the client said so"".\r\n\r\n""The client said so"" is their favorite excuse. They will bend over backwards to make sure that the client is satisfied, often at the expense of their workers\' satisfaction.\r\n\r\nYour performance will be measured by how the customer rates you, without any sort of discrimination. A customer is angry because they didn\'t get a refund, you get a bad review - your fault. The funny thing is that absolutely no one in 5CA agrees with this approach... but the client does, and the client said so, and so it shall be.\r\n\r\nThe excuse for this sort of thing will always be that 5CA is a business, and that profit is necessary, and that if we don\'t please the client, there is no business to begin with. And that\'s all fine, except this is nowhere near the picture that 5CA paints with their marketing.\r\n\r\nThe picture that they paint is one of a modern, inclusive work environment, where everybody is welcome and everybody is a big family. Lie. You sit alone at your computer, working literally non-stop every day to meet productivity standards, sometimes sharing memes in your team chat, that\'s about it.\r\n\r\nAs for career development, don\'t even think about it. 5CA doesn\'t care about your development, and they don\'t give you the opportunity to work on it. You have 30 minutes per week to talk with your manager/team lead, during which you briefly go over your own metrics and numbers, and then it\'s back to work. \r\n\r\nThe only way you can get promoted in 5CA is if you\'re lucky to be at the right place at the right time, or if you\'re willing to compromise your quality of life - e.g. choose a lousy shift like working from 3AM with Thursday and Friday off, as a temporary team lead that might get demoted down to an agent in a few months, if you don\'t immediately produce the results that they expect from you (in other words, if you\'re not lucky that the agents in your team happen to have a good customer satisfaction score, as a whole, at the time that you\'re on ""trial"").\r\n\r\nSo, my final advice: ignore 5CA\'s sugarcoated superficial image. It\'s a lie. Accept the job only if you need the money, only if you can negotiate a salary that you can use to live a comfortable life (there are other jobs to make ends meet if you\'re looking for that, something brainless, like data entry). Otherwise, there\'s no point. There\'s absolutely nothing that you can get from this company except money. Not one thing. So at least make the money thing count.', 'Nothing that I can mention.']"
