Salary indication € 3,974 - € 7,362
Deadline 14 Apr 2023
The Context

The Computer Science department of the University of Twente is expanding. Therefore, we are hiring 6 new faculty members, to strengthen our research in Artificial Intelligence, Cyberphysical systems and Software Engineering in the domains of (1) e-Health and (2) energy and sustainability. These new faculty members will be assigned in different research groups, but inter-group collaboration with other researchers working on these themes is considered essential to reach our overall ambitions. This position focuses on research in e-Health within a multidisciplinary setting.

The Position

The current way how healthcare is organized is no longer sustainable. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Remote Monitoring (RM) are key enabling technologies for a more sustainable and personalized care. E-health calls for system integration: sensor-based collection and interpretation of data about the condition and circumstances of patients, the integration of health data from different organizations in the care chain, and the Machine Learning based analysis of this data with AI for (real-time) clinical decision making (diagnostics and interventions).

Data Management and Biometrics (DMB) is a diverse research group that aims to develop efficient and trustworthy technology for data science and artificial intelligence by developing methods for autonomous, explainable, reliable, and robust gathering, preparation, and analysis of the data. On the theme of e-Health, DMB closely collaborates with other research groups associated with the University of Twente’s TechMed centre, such as the Biomedical Signals and Systems group (BSS), the Human Media Interaction group (HMI), and the Pervasive Systems group (PS). The research groups have strong collaborations with regional and (inter)national organizations such as hospitals, rehabilitation centres, elderly homes, insurance companies, companies developing medical devices and/or information systems, and many other kinds of organizations in the Health sector.

For this position, we are looking for a multi-disciplinary researcher and teacher on technology for holistic remote (multi) sensor-based monitoring and/or artificial intelligence for decision making, for whom collaboration is a second nature. Your teaching is intended to be primarily directed towards the bachelor Creative Technology and the master Interaction Technology.

Your profile
You have a strong interest and have shown ability to collaborate in an academic, multidisciplinary environment;
You have a PhD degree in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or related discipline;
You have demonstrated the ability to perform high-quality research in a field relevant to the theme of AI in e-Health such as but not limited to remote monitoring of patients, sensor-based machine learning for human behaviour or physiology modeling, explainable AI, machine learning for medical or behavioural decision making (diagnostics and interventions);
You have shown a willingness to acquire external funding and are prepared to expand your skills in this aspect;
You have good communication skills and are a team player;
You are fluent in English (knowledge of, or willingness to learn Dutch is an advantage);
You have a University Teaching Qualification (Dutch: BKO) or equivalent or you are willing to acquire one within three years.
Our offer
We offer a permanent position with a one-year probationary period (formally a 1-year contract with prospect of permanent contract) in the Data Management and Biometrics research group.
The position comes with a start-up package that allows you to appoint one PhD student.
Our terms of employment are in accordance with the Dutch Collective Labor Agreement for Universities (CAO) and include a holiday allowance of 8% of the gross annual salary and a year-end bonus of 8.3%.
Depending on your relevant background and experience, the gross monthly salary on a full-time basis ranges from € 3974,- (scale 11) to € 7.362,- (scale 14) gross per month.
A minimum of 29 leave days in case of full-time employment based on a formal workweek of 38 hours. A fulltime employment in practice means 40 hours a week, therefore resulting in 96 extra leave hours on an annual basis.
A solid pension scheme.
Free access to sport facilities on campus.
We are a family-friendly institution, which offers parental leave for both parents (both paid and unpaid) and career support for partners.
We appreciate diversity of profiles, cultures, and backgrounds, and promote an inclusive working culture.
Furthermore, we offer excellent professional and personal development programs.
Finally, you work in a lively, inspiring, and dynamic working environment in an organization focusing on internationalization, where you have a high degree of responsibility and independence.

Assistant/Associate Professor Causal Reinforcement Learning,"Assistant/Associate Professor Causal Reinforcement Learning
 Apply Now
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are literally changing the world. However, many AI and ML techniques employ statistical models that do not take this into account. This can lead to a plethora of problems, of which performance lower than expected is perhaps the most benign. In contrast, causal models try and capture the true effect of interventions or ‘actions’, while reinforcement learning deals with understanding the long-term outcomes of such actions over time. Will you build on these techniques to set up a research program on how intelligent systems can better understand the true outcome of their actions and predictions?

New Opportunities Group
New Opportunities brings the majority of our extensive breadth of technical expertise to ensure large scale transformation of education systems into one team. This team kick-starts new programs in new countries. Each member of the team is responsible for a core area of expertise, and then setting up all work and functions related to that expertise in the new program/new country. This includes putting all relevant policies, practices, systems and technology in place, and leading the hiring of the leader who will take charge of this work as the permanent lead for this body of work. This is NewGlobes SWAT team, with specialists brought together to solve the critical and urgent problem of launching a state or nation-wide new program. This team must work collaboratively, thrive in creating order out of chaos, and understand that proactive problem solving is a daily task. All members of this team should expect extensive travel to remote and underserved areas, and to be resident in 2 other locations per year, setting up new programs. When not deployed on starting a specific program, each team member will do work with the core technical team which he or she represents, to support special projects, deepen technical knowledge, and otherwise advance in the field. This team is critical to NewGlobe delivering on our shared vision of transforming the lives of 10,000,000+ children, and in so doing seeing peace and prosperity where we work.
Technology
Technology plays a critical role enabling us to provide transformative education at massive scale in highly resource constrained environments. This is one of the key elements that gives us the ability to deliver radically impactful programmes, creating brighter futures for a generation of children across the world each day. Technology spans several key functions, including Product Management, Business Intelligence, Software Development, and IT Operations.
About the Role
Technology at NewGlobe is a highly complex, vertically-integrated affair, with systems supporting an ever expanding range of functions and countries, and crossing between software development, business intelligence, IT operations, and logistics/supply chain. At the same time, our teams run lean and things change fast – governments make policy decisions that affect us, launching new territories is a frenetic affair, and we still need to evolve our core technology offering.
This role is about ensuring that NewGlobes investments in technology translate into rapid and reliable launches, appropriately localised offerings, and sustainable at-scale operations. To achieve that, it will require deep knowledge of the existing NewGlobe tools and processes, an exceptional ability to collaborate, listen, and communicate, and a passion for continuous improvement. Above all else, this role is about being a technologist who can be a fast-moving and utterly resilient problem solver, while simultaneously being obsessed with ensuring the scale and sustainability of our operations.
When deployed as part of a new launch, this person will be on-ground as the Technology representative in the cross-functional New Opportunities team, adapting and deploying the existing set of tools and processes and infrastructure to the local context, hiring and training the future IT Operations team, and generally doing whatever is necessary. To achieve that goal, this person will be supported by and oversee a small globally distributed technology team assigned to the launch, including staff from both software development and IT Operations. But it will also mean rolling up sleeves, doing systems administration, installing software, working with local vendors, and whatever else is necessary to make the technology go.
When not participating in a new launch, this person will be catching up on the latest developments within the Technology group and working to make the next launch better, faster, cheaper.
This person will report to the Vice President of New Opportunities, with a functional reporting line to the CTO. This person will be a member of the core Technology Leadership team, alongside directors owning the IT Operations, Software Development, Product Management, and Programme Management functions, respectively.
What You Will Do

Hire and on-board the IT Operations manager and team (up to 10+) who will take over operations post-launch
Support academics and leadership and development teams to provide tech support for teacher trainings for up to 10,000 teachers in first 3 months in-country
Manage the local hardware and infrastructure setup, under the oversight of the shared services IT Operations director, to ensure that support office infrastructure (internet, PBX, firewalls, domain controllers, etc.), IT assets (smartphones, tablets, laptops, etc.), and tech consumables (software licenses, airtime, etc.) are procured and available in a way that is timely, cost-effective, and consistent with established NewGlobe standards.
Build awareness and perform training around the existing technology toolset for the local teams, including new products or functionality that might not have existed in prior launches
Ensure the right balance between standardisation (including pushing back on local teams to adopt) and localisation (including pushing back on shared services teams to adapt)
Oversee the technology shared services teams assigned to a launch, including prioritisation of issues for resolution, necessary customisations, and the coordination of associated timelines and releases. Changes to software systems to be overseen by the shared services Software Development director.
Act as the single point of contact on ground for Technology during a launch, meaning communicating a clear and complete picture back to the Technology Leadership teams and also communicating information back from those teams to the local teams
Prevent shadow systems and misinformation from becoming embedded
Between launches, work with other technology departments and functions to improve future launches, including product strategy, software development, IT Operations, and business intelligence
Advocate relentlessly for - and personally embrace - the use of data and reports to drive facts-based and at-scale decision making

What You Should Have

Experience deploying and overseeing technology in low infrastructure and physically remote environments - limited or unreliable access to power, limited or unreliable access to network, difficult or slow to reach in person, and often using low spec hardware.
Experience that includes mobile applications and enterprise mobility management are a big plus.
Experience working across multiple teams and departments, especially in a globally distributed and matrixed organisation.
Strong project management skills, especially with both lean processes that are designed to work in rapidly changing environments and also with more formal structures designed for complex and well-defined projects
Understanding of networking infrastructure (routers, switches, firewalls, domain controllers) and the associated setup and configuration
Competency with other types of systems administration tasks, esp. Linux-based systems, such as PBXs, LAMP-stack OSS, etc.
Familiarity with ITIL, Information Security, and Identity Management best practices.
Experience participating in modern software development and continuous delivery processes, including automated deployment pipelines, microservice APIs, frequent releases, and fast feedback
Proficiency in the use of monitoring tools to oversee systems at a distance and at scale (and to reduce mean time to response)
Exceptional listening, communication, and collaboration skills
7+ years relevant IT/industry work experience
Bachelor's degree with strong academic performance
Experience of living and/or working in emerging markets, including rural and remote communities .

You’re also

A detailed doer – You have a track record of getting things done. You’re organized and responsive. You take ownership of every idea you touch and execute it to a fine level of detail, setting targets, engaging others, and doing whatever it takes to get the job done. You can multi-task dozens of such projects at once and never lose sight of the details. Likely, you have some experience in a start-up or other rapid-growth company.
A networking mastermind – You excel at meeting new people and turning them into advocates. You communicate in a clear, conscientious, and effective way in both written and oral speech. You can influence strangers in the course of a single conversation. Allies and colleagues will go to bat for your ideas. You have an existing network from prior experience in the country, preferably in the regulatory, education, or business sectors.
A creative problem-solver – Growing any business from scratch comes with massive and constant challenges. On top of that, NewGlobe works in often fragile, sometimes volatile low-resource communities and with complex government systems. You need to be flexible and ready to get everything done effectively, quickly, and affordably with the materials at hand.
A relentless advocate –The children we serve and teachers we empower never leave your mind. You know them, get them, have shared a meal with them (or would be happy to in the future). You would never shrink back from shaking a parent’s hand or picking up a crying child, no matter what the person was wearing or looked like. Every decision you make considers their benefit, experience, 
and value.

Full Professor in Energy System Integration,"Full Professor in Energy System Integration
 Apply Now
Job description
Energy System Integration (ESI) takes a holistic view of the electricity and heat sectors to deliver a sustainable, reliable and affordable energy system. It addresses integration issues of energy systems on several scales, such as the infrastructures needed for production, transport and storage of energy, identifying desired transition paths, cross-sectoral cooperation etc. A combination of mitigation technologies such as carbon capture utilization, demand-side measures, energy efficiency improvements, electrification of heat and transport, production and use of (green) hydrogen as feedstock and/or fuel, and other innovations could together bring emissions much closer to net zero. In addition to these technical parts, an integrated system also comprises social and institutional dimensions that interact with each other.

The analysis and shaping of the energy system over time and its interaction with other systems (e.g, the industry, transportation system) and their impact on the environment, the wider economy and society, is core to the domain of this new full professor position. One of the main pillars in the proposed research area focuses on the role of hydrogen in the transition towards a sustainable and low-carbon society.

The research will analyse interrelations between technology, business models and policy in an uncertain environment. The objective is to support policy makers and industrial actors with adopting low-carbon technologies while maintaining competitiveness. While ESI entails physical exchanges of energy within and between energy systems, data and information exchanges are needed to make the integration possible. ICT and energy digitalisation are core components of ESI, creating challenges with respect to incentive design, data transparency rules and clear third-party access policies. In addition, market design and regulation shape the actors’ behaviour. Therefore, the research focuses on the interrelations between the physical energy value chain, the ICT and data systems and the markets and the economic regulation of the system. Methodologically, the focus is on integrated system modelling.

The full-professor position is positioned within the Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management (TPM), department of Engineering Systems and Services (ESS), and more specifically in the Energy and Industry group where research on energy systems integration, energy systems transition, and smart-grids takes place. The department hosts, next to these energy system experts, mobility (passenger as well as freight) and ICT experts (data platforms, distributed systems, IT architectures), as well as choice modelling and decision making scholars; this combination of expertises guarantees that the cross-sectoral and socio-technical characteristics of the energy system integration are effectively addressed, involving e.g. providing carbon-neutral fuels, defosilization of industry, electric mobility and the shift to a circular economy.
Requirements
The successful candidate has an inspiring personality and can act as a driver for energy system integration in the Netherlands and beyond. Leveraging communication and networking skills, she/he will connect with colleagues and partners within and outside TU Delft to boost renewable energy and cooperate on green technology and innovation.

Further, the candidate:

holds a PhD degree in a relevant field of engineering science, such as (complex) systems engineering, energy (mechanical) engineering, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, environmental engineering or physics/applied mathematics;
has a proven track record as an independent, productive and esteemed researcher of high integrity;
has proven research experience and/or demonstrable affinity with integrated socio-technical systems approaches to energy systems and its modelling;
has proven experience in acquiring research funding;
has a cooperative research attitude and a firm track record in multidisciplinary research;
has demonstrable experience in initiating, leading and managing research programs;
is a strong communicator, able to communicate research results to the professional community as well as to the general public;
is a good teacher who inspires students and professionals alike, and has experience in supervising PhD research projects.

If you feel this function would be a perfect match, but you cannot tick some boxes yet, please react too.

You're also
A detailed doer – You have a track record of getting things done. You're organised and responsive. You take ownership of every idea you touch and execute it to a fine level of detail, setting targets, engaging others, and doing whatever it takes to get the job done. You can multi-task dozens of such projects at once and never lose sight of the details. Likely, you have some experience in a start-up or other rapid-growth company.
A networking mastermind – You excel at meeting new people and turning them into advocates. You communicate in a clear, conscientious, and effective way in both written and oral speech. You can influence strangers in the course of a single conversation. Allies and colleagues will go to bat for your ideas. You have an existing network from prior experience in the country, preferably in the regulatory, education, or business sectors.
A creative problem-solver – Growing any business from scratch comes with massive and constant challenges. On top of that, NewGlobe works in often fragile, sometimes volatile low-resource communities and with complex government systems. You need to be flexible and ready to get everything done effectively, quickly, and affordably with the materials at hand.
A relentless advocate –The children we serve and teachers we empower never leave your mind. You know them, get them, have shared a meal with them (or would be happy to in the future). You would never shrink back from shaking a parent's hand or picking up a crying child, no matter what the person was wearing or looked like. Every decision you make considers their benefit, experience,

and value.
A malleable learner –You believe you can always do better. You welcome constructive criticism and provide it freely to others. You know you only get better tomorrow when others point out where you've missed things or failed today.
A curious investigator – You ask why a lot. You don't just take what you see and accept it. You wonder why it is that way, and are aware that the world we see is created by human choices and actions – and it could be different. You wonder, and see the world as wonderful even when you want to change a part of it that is unjust.",https://media.glassdoor.com/sql/150407/delft-university-of-technology-squarelogo-1407303199964.png,Delft,nan,TU Delft,"['Great work culture and ethics, well equipped laboratories.
