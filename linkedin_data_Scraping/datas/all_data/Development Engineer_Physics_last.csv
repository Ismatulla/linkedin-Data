(Junior) Engineer,"Waarom jij Post en Dekker vooruit brengt

Jouw kennis en inzet draagt bij aan onze missie. Om in de ontwikkelketen van OEM’ers modulaire configure-to-order productfamilies te ontwerpen die beter, goedkoper en sneller te realiseren zijn. De aanpak is daarbij uniek door integraal vanuit het complete bedrijfsproces van de klant (inkoop, verkoop, onderhoud, etc) naar het product te kijken, de belangen te inventariseren en deze naar een projectplan om te zetten. Binnen dit plan ben jij de (junior) engineer, innovator en ontwerper om in diverse projecten te ondersteunen, te ontwikkelen en te adviseren. Onze missie voor klanten blijft hetzelfde, de diversiteit en mogelijkheden binnen projecten niet. Geen project of product is hetzelfde.

Samen met je team help je Post en Dekker vooruit door op de juiste manier om te gaan met: een grote mate van zelfstandigheid, je drang naar perfectie, creatieve vrijheid om concepten op te stellen en de klant te bedienen. Kan jij je hier in vinden? Dan ben jij voor ons de sleutel tot succes. Samen weten we meer en zo komen we vooruit.

Hoe jouw dag eruit kan komen te zien

Laten we met een kop koffie beginnen en een blik op de 3D printer. Als (junior) engineer binnen de maakindustrie kan je dat wel waarderen. Soms werkt hij niet, dan mag je er zelf even aan sleutelen. Als de cafeïne toeslaat ben jij al bezig met het doornemen van je mail en het bestuderen van je technisch ontwerp van de dag ervoor. Zo snel mogelijk neem je deel aan de dagplanning. Een ‘stand-up’ zoals wij dat noemen. Je bespreekt wat je hebt ontworpen, waar je tegenaan loopt. Samen met iemand uit je team bespreek je de eventuele oplossingen zodat je verder kan met je ontwerp. Je vervolgt de ochtend met je 3D CAD ontwerpen, voer je analyses uit en plan jij je werkaanpak in.

In de middag is de senior engineer weer terug van de klant, samen met je collega. Volgende keer ga jij mee. Samen met je team bespreek je de samenwerking en voortgang van het project. Als (junior) engineer ben je, samen met de senior engineer, verantwoordelijk voor het ontwikkelen, definiëren, analyseren en realiseren van machineconcepten, -modules en -onderdelen voor de klant. De rest van de middag staat de vrijheid om te innoveren voorop en draag je ook bij aan de conceptfase van het ontwerp samen met de senior engineer en de projectleider. Tussendoor bekijk en bouw je mee aan het prototype in de werkplaats.

Zitten de uren en taken erop? Tijd voor je vrije tijd. Morgen weer een nieuwe dag waarbij alles anders kan zijn. Geen dag is hetzelfde.

Jouw ervaringen en kwaliteiten

Jouw ‘toolbelt’ zit vol met:

3D-cad software kennis: Inventor, SolidWorks en Creo
Openstaan voor integraal en modulair ontwerpen om de klant te kunnen ondersteunen en adviseren
1 tot 2 jaar ervaring met het ontwerpen en realiseren van machines en productfamilies
Academisch opgeleid (bv: werktuigbouwkunde, Industrieel ontwerpen)
Het kunnen uitvoeren van concept- basic engineering tot detail engineering en realisatie
Het kunnen uitvoeren van analyses (EEM, FMEA, Risico, etc)
Het kunnen plannen en uitvoeren van een projectmatige werkaanpak (PRINCE2/Agile)
Denken in: ‘hoe kan het beter’ en niet in: ‘zo hebben we het altijd gedaan’

Wat we van elkaar verwachten

Een mooi boven marktconform salaris krijg je aan het einde van de maand
Pensioen en winstuitkering
Jij krijgt de vrijheid, flexibiliteit en zelfstandigheid in het uitwerken en uitdetailleren van concepten en verwachten daar een sterke ‘drive’ voor terug
Een ‘millenial-proof’ organisatie: flexibele werktijden, ns businesscards, mogelijkheid tot sabbatical (in overleg) en een informele werksfeer

Wat Post en Dekker voor jou als sociale techneut interessant maakt

Af en toe een potje tafeltennis met je collega’s
Niet alleen modulaire ontwerpen: ook system development en protobouw
Een E-kart om in te rijden (zelf gebouwd!)
Kennis opdoen en delen middels onze interne strategische sessies en masterclasses
Je wil je kennis ontwikkelen en vergroten door trainingen? Wij voorzien, graag zelfs!
Bij de klant of bij P&D bouwen en testen van prototypes
Het vieren van successen met borrels en excursies

Meer weten over onze unieke aanpak? Hoe je kan bijdragen aan ons verhaal om de beste kwaliteit te leveren voor de maakindustrie?
