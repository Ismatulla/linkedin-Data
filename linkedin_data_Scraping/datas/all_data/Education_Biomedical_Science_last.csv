PhD position “Time-resolved and calibrated spectroscopy of EUV light sources”,"Key takeaways
Hours 38 - 40 hr.
Salary indication € 2,541 - € 3,247
Deadline 31 Mar 2023
Are you enthusiastic about exploring scientific challenges with an industrial application perspective?

Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) is the latest generation of the semiconductor manufacturing technology powered by laser-produced-plasma light sources. These EUV light sources emit in a broad range of wavelengths spanning from soft x-rays to visible. A quantitative spectral characterization capability of such a broad wavelength range recently become available using a proprietary transmission grating spectrometer developed by XUV optics group (https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0073839). The calibration of the charge-coupled-device (CCD) that are used as detectors in such a spectrometer is sensitive to the operation conditions of the light source. Cross-calibration of the CCD with other type of detectors such as photodiodes and investigating the light sources with time resolution provides wealth of information that is otherwise not accessible.

We are looking for a motivated and skilled PhD student to carry out research on the fundamental physics questions on the calibration sensitivity and time-dependent spectral evolution of the EUV light source. Methods to enable inline calibration and time-resolved operation is to be developed in the project with the support of technical staff.

The XUV Optics Group at Twente has started a new multidisciplinary research program on these topics. We develop forefront fundamental research, relevant to high tech applications (www.utwente.nl/xuv/). The research will take place in a state-of-the-art thin film laboratory within the MESA+ Institute for Nanotechnology at the University of Twente, in collaboration with various academic and industrial partners. The XUV group has a track record in developing thin film physics and holds several records in functional film properties, including the reflectivity of thin film multilayer optics.

Your goal is to develop the fundamental physics understanding on time-resolved and calibrated spectroscopy of EUV light sources. This includes:

Understanding the sensitivity of detector calibration to the operation conditions of the EUV light source,
Designing and developing filters/coatings to enable online calibration at various wavelengths,
Analyzing the properties of the developed filters/coatings using characterization techniques such as AFM, XRD, XRR and SEM,
Understanding the time-dependent evolution of the spectral emission of the EUV light sources.
Your profile
You have a master’s degree in physics, materials science, optics, laser physics, solid state or surface physics or a related field.
It is a plus to have lab experience with vacuum systems, plasma, spectroscopy, thin film deposition and/or analysis setups.
You are an excellent team player in an enthusiastic group of scientists and engineers working on a common theme.
You are creative, like to push boundaries, and are highly motivated to address a major science challenge in thin film physics.
You are fluent in English and able to collaborate intensively with industrial and academic parties in regular meetings and work visits.
Our offer
You will be appointed on a fulltime position for 4 years. The position is available immediately.
The university offers a dynamic ecosystem with enthusiastic colleagues in a stimulating scientific environment.
The PhD salary is € 2.541 in the first year, increasing to € 3.247 in the fourth year.

Job description
The Ethics and Philosophy of Technology (EPT) section is looking for a postdoc who will conduct research in the ethics of pandemic and disaster. This is a 4-year fulltime position consisting of 80% of research time and 20% teaching time, contributing to the teaching of the EPT Section. The research part of this position will be conducted in the context of the multidisciplinary Frontrunner projects of the Pandemic and Disaster Preparedness Centre.

Erasmus MC, TU Delft and Erasmus University Rotterdam have joined forces in the Pandemic and Disaster Preparedness Center (PDPC). The PDPC aims to prepare society for future pandemics and disasters. We will reduce vulnerabilities and risks and build resilience through effective disaster prevention, preparedness and recovery measures. Convergence of the technical, medical and social sciences is essential for developing the next generation of approaches to disasters and pandemics.

The Frontrunner Projects kick-start the long-term research agenda of the PDPC. Leading experts from various disciplines collaborate with people from implementing organizations within these research projects to develop knowledge about pandemics and disasters and the social issues they can be expected to cause. These projects are organized in and around doctoral programmes and living labs,
around five main themes:
Frontrunner project 1: Climate change and vector- borne virus outbreaksFrontrunner project 2: Predicting, measuring and quantifying airborne virus transmissionFrontrunner project 3: Pandemic lessons for flood disaster preparedness
Frontrunner project 4: Towards social and urban resilienceFrontrunner project 5: Integrated early-warning surveillance methods and tools

As the ethics post doc in the Pandemic and Disaster Preparedness Centre (PDPC) you will identify and perform research into the conceptual and ethical questions about the scientific research ongoing on the PDPC, as well as its potential consequences in the wider world. These include addressing questions in relation to PDPC research, including scientific methods, models, ethics of living labs, and how science results and risks are understood and communicated both by researchers and the public.

You will examine and contribute towards the on-going work of the frontrunners and their interactions, and also assist with providing ethics/policy advice and developing educational programmes for the Frontrunners. You will also develop a perspective on how themes emerging from the PDPC provide lessons for future emergency preparedness. Your work will be self-directed, but in close collaboration with the PIs and ethics staff of TU Delft and Erasmus MC, as well as with Frontrunner researchers, using a mixed methods approach of theoretical analysis and empirical work, including integrating stakeholder views.
Requirements
We are looking for applicants with the following qualifications:
PhD degree in the field of philosophy and a specialisation in e.g. philosophy of science, politics and governance, biomedical ethics, or related fields in applied ethicsInterest in reflecting on topics like research using qualitative methods, and/or in science communicationExcellent English skills, Dutch is an assetFlexibility and readiness to work in interdisciplinary teams (e.g. experience with co-authorship, working in multidisciplinary teams, or similar)
Conditions of employment
The salary for postdoc positions varies from € 3.703 - €5.439 per month gross depending on experience.

Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, a discount on health insurance and sport memberships, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.
