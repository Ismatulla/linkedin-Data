Software Engineer,"Wat doet een Software Engineer?
Je werkt in een multidisciplinair team met de beste engineers die projecten uitvoeren met een hoog innovatief karakter voor opdrachtgevers uit de agri- en foodindustrie.
Als Software Engineer ben je vanaf het begin tot eind betrokken bij een innovatieproject. Je participeert in brainstorm- en innovatiesessies, dit een belangrijk onderdeel van onze aanpak. Jouw visie als software engineer maakt deel uit van de oplossing voor de klant. Je bent praktisch ingesteld en maakt gebruik van data om tot de kern van het probleem te komen. Met zowel je teamgenoten als opdrachtgevers ben je regelmatig in contact om de voortgang van het project te bespreken.
Jij bent voornamelijk verantwoordelijk voor een goedwerkende besturing van de oplossing. Dit doe je ook als software engineer:
Je kiest de juiste software oplossing(en) en het software ontwerp.
Je koppelt de juiste technologieën om tot een geschikte oplossing te komen. De kracht ligt in het samenbrengen van applicaties.
Je zorgt voor de juiste implementatie en een goed geteste applicatie.
Bij QING werken we aan een grote verscheidenheid van projecten. Je focust je ook op de technologieën: Simulatie, Machine Vision en Robotics. Dit kan software schrijven voor een robot zijn, het toepassen van Machine Vision applicatie of het uitvoeren van simulaties om software te testen.
Daarnaast werk je ook met meerdere softwareapplicaties, zoals industriële PC’s, en PLC,HMI/SCADA.
Deze skills breng je mee als Software Engineer
Wat je vooral écht leuk moet vinden, en dus goed moet kunnen, is technische vraagstukken omzetten in innovatieve softwareoplossingen voor de industrie. Een aantal jaren ervaring is een pre. Met name de wil en het vermogen om jezelf en het bedrijf verder te ontwikkelen is het belangrijkste.
Wat je verder meeneemt:
Een HBO-opleiding op het gebied van Software Engineering Embedded systems, Industriële Automatisering en/of (Technische) Informatica,
2 tot 3 jaar werkervaring in industriële software is een pre.
Ervaring met programmeertalen, zoals C, C + +,C# en Python is een pre.",https://media.glassdoor.com/sql/7673311/qing-groep-squarelogo-1662547353854.png,Arnhem,nan,QING,"['Flexible employer, colleagues are nice']","['Low pay, less interesting projects.']"

I guess this was due to the company growing and getting better group rates. Regardless, not many people can say that.\r\n\r\nYou’ll frequently come to work that day expecting to work on a certain project and end up on something totally different. This can be good and bad.\r\n\r\nStarting hours are typically flexible, which is a really nice perk. Nobody is making sure you’re in your seat at a certain time.\r\n\r\nMost employees are surprisingly responsive and friendly.\r\n\r\nVery heavy email-based communication, and it mostly works quite well.\r\n\r\nYou get good at doing the best you can with the resources you have, rather than doing the best possible job.

Healthcare for me that would have cost well over $15,000 on many non-Tesla plans was achieved for well under $1,500 out of pocket, during my time of employment. Let us face it, in America, ultimately the good healthcare plan is what you need, the house with the Spanish style architecture and palm trees is what you want, yet the top-notch employee benefits are what you need that are there at organizations like Tesla who hire direct, and not with organizations that do the 12 month contracts or 15 month contracts through a 3rd party. Given the wages are not high due to the industry having tighter profit margins compared to other Silicon Valley businesses (SaaS, IT consulting, Internet companies), I hoped for some sort of tuition reimbursement, yet I cannot just expect that any company is going to foot the bill of my education loan debt; they did offer benefits for refinancing education debt, as well as other debt. Note: I can only speak to my role as being direct hire. In the 9-to-5 itself, I really loved the structure. You always know exactly what the expectations are.', 'Enjoyed working there, pay and benefits were good but not amazing, management was pretty good as I can not complain even after being fired.', 'Looks good on a resume.

Exciting company to work for. Company not stuck on traditional automotive ideas/processes. Many opportunities for growth and promotion.']","['Change is inevitable \r\nVery very very very spontaneous\r\nFast paced', '- Sometimes the pace of changes is pushed to extreme', 'Rare to be recognized, let alone thanked, for going above and beyond to accomplish something out of the ordinary. Once you\'ve ""done the impossible"", it\'s just assumed that you can and will do it again and again from now on. \r\n\r\nLiterally hundreds of people in one room, desks on top of each other, as many as possible in every little space. Companies claim that they’re being “modern” and “progressive” by not having offices and cubicles, but they’re just being cheap. Look at pictures of offices from the 1950’s. You’ll see the same hundreds of desks in a room.\r\n\r\nYearly raises are typically less than the cost of living\r\n\r\nWork/life balance is mediocre at best\r\n\r\nSmallish yearly bonuses in the form of golden handcuffs. RSUs that vest over 4 years, so you’ll wait a long time to benefit from them\r\n\r\nThose who were hired before mid-2013 made a lot of money off stock options, but many of those people are leaving now that all of their options are used up. \r\n\r\nRevolving door. It’s hard to last more than a couple of years here. \r\n\r\nIt’s always seemingly a few steps away from massive failure\r\n\r\nVery few processes in place, so work is done extremely inefficiently\r\n\r\nVery common to compose an email and see “This is no longer a valid Tesla address”\r\n\r\nThe entire Service organization shares one budget. I am scrimping to save $50 on software while a barely-related manager wastes literally tens of thousands of dollars a week on cool toys, and it all comes from the same place.\r\n\r\nEverything’s urgent, and people try to name-drop that Elon’s watching this very project so I need to stop everything for them. Luckily those of us who have been around for a while see right through that charade.\r\n\r\nTechnically, no 401(k) match, though if you’re careful with the health benefits you choose, you can end up with some leftover that can be diverted into the 401(k).\r\n\r\nMiddle managers are very hit-and-miss. Many were promoted because a manager was needed and they were the only one who knew anything about the department. Much room for improvement here.\r\n\r\nMinimal leadership training. No real employee development opportunities. The results are just as bad as you’d expect.\r\n\r\nMassive inter-departmental struggles. Most of my problems can be traced to one power-hungry manager of a sister department. It only takes one person to ruin the work lives of many people. \r\n\r\nThere are more meetings than I expected from this kind of company. Elon sent a great email about how wasteful meetings are, but people have fallen into old bad habits.\r\n\r\nCompletely ineffective HR department\r\n\r\nEvery department is grossly understaffed, just barely above the point of collapse. Nearly everyone has to work harder than they would if they were doing the same job at another company.\r\n\r\nAnything that they can do in house, they’ll do, rather than outsourcing to a supplier. There are people who spend their whole careers deciding “make vs. buy”… no need for them here, it seems. This is corporate arrogance, and it reduces quality, wastes human resources, and slows time to market in many cases. A positive side effect is that more products are made here in California than would be if they were outsourced.\r\n\r\nInadequate parking\r\n\r\nNote to hiring managers at other companies: Watch out if someone from Tesla has “Project Manager” on their title. Many of these people are just general office workers with no skills beyond harassing people via email.', 'My one wish would be that there was an outlined pathway for: ""coming in as a Data Annotation Specialist, this is what education you need to do additionally and what job performance you need to move forward into a Data Scientist role or Software Engineer role at this company"". Essentially, because there was not that pathway lined out, I resigned to pursue finishing a Computer Science degree and find a more known and less unknown career pathway.', ""Not enough machine time or time doing any specific tasks beyond deburring, stoning/polishing and assembly. I understand with the advancements of cnc machining that a lot of these other tasks are less frequent/necessary, however that compounded with not wanting an apprentice to do it makes it more difficult to gain more skills. A lot of miscommunication or unclear communication issues where there isn't a clear answer; reading between the lines. I know being a glorified defacto janitor is common for apprentices for a while, but it does seem a bit excessive when it is a weekly, sometimes daily occurrence to have no work to do/being allowed to do."", ""Working as a production associate at Tesla you will work 12 hours shift and you may have some injuries (hands, shoulders, knees, back, feet). Sometimes the production leaders dont make rotations and it makes you have more injuries because the repetitive tasks for 12 hours. You will see pregnant women working hard stand up for 12 hours as well. If you work for Model Y the location is a big tent where there are gas forklifts (no electric) and you will breath polution all day! There are supervisors and managers that don't have any leadership skills and does not know the production process. Some of them yell to employees in the production line and treat them like garbage. There are a lot of rude people working at Tesla. Disrespectful  enviroment, harassment, people without basic good manners. Some inefficient and lazy people have been promoted because they play politic stuffs with Supervisors. Does not matter how good you are and how hard you work, you won't be recognized. The maximum it can happen they will give you some shares but you must to work there for 5 years to have them. Nowdays the shares have lost value. The company is very desorganized, has a completely ineffective HR department and no employee development opportunities . Have your body being destroyed, rude supervisors and managers, politic stuffs, dont be recognized, all these things for $21,00/hour."", 'Difficult work life balance. Especially when in management. the company creates its own chaos, so the working environment is always stressful. Upper management pays little attention to recommendation of workers in the field. During the last layoff they placed old sales leaders in roles they were not qualified to save their jobs. Mostly in service roles. While it sounds good to save jobs, old service staff were moved out to make room for sales staff. Now the people running service have no understanding of how service works.', '- rush culture leads to own goals and missed opportunities to maximize rate of innovation - sub-C leadership levels underempowered relative to demonstrated competence - facilities improving, but lacks corporate focus & resourcing to reach world class - employee parking always an afterthought - poor functionality / inefficiency persists in numerous daily-use software systems - chaotic CEO', 'Long commute from San Antonio to Austin every day.

I had line of sight to my direct manager, no more, no less. Between the C-suite floating heads and my manager, there was a faceless, amorphous amalgam of names that would appear in an All-hands, or on a CC chain, but never seemed to interact. There was no one distinct, unified goal. There was very little up-to date internal Cart.com documentation. (Formerly)Americommerce documentation was plentiful and thorough, if outdated.

Many have complained that they don't get value from the product, and some have canceled contracts after the long delay.

Salespeople are trying to sell the most expensive services instead of a product that can quickly solve a customer's problems.

Additionally, upper management that were hired in the recent few months clearly can't generate revenue for the company.
