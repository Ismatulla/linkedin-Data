Having worked in HR for 20+ years, it is always fascinating to be on the candidate side of the table during the interview process. I was very impressed with from start to finish. I had a three (3) Zoom calls with Kite Leadership, along with calls with the recruiter. All were very professional, easy to speak to, and engaging. I never thought I was grilled about my background, but rather shared stories about my past as if catching up with someone from my past. Equally, they all shared their experiences and how they ended up with a great company. Additionally, all explained their passion for working for a company that is helping to fight and cure cancer! All had amazing enthusiasm for the mission! The candidate process was thoroughly explained to me and communication was prompt and timely. I also think they all did an excellent job of explaining what to expect in the role in terms of responsibility, success in the role, work life balance, etc. Lastly, I never felt like I was in the dark about what to expect next in the candidate process. I was sent company information, along with benefit information, and had contact information if I had any questions. I never went onsite to the facility during the process, as they have kept the interviewing process to Zoom from the pandemic. I was sent an inspiring promotional video that interviewed some employees and flashed through the facility. During the offer, I was offered to visit onsite, but declined as I didn’t want to step outside of their normal protocols and stated that from the promotional video I was sent, “it looks like it may be the nicest facility I’ve ever worked!” Overall, again a great experience and looking forward to orientation and starting!', ""Very young and nice atmosphere. It's not a suit and tie environment but more so casual."", 'I feel appreciated and am paid well. I feel great going to work and knowing my staff are paid well and have room to grow if they want to. The company is working hard to promote inclusion, diversity, and equity. I have had many jobs in my life but none have been nearly as rewarding. I feel like a human and not a number. As a leader I’m encouraged to ask, “how can we help ________ succeed?” instead of, “How do we get rid of _______?” We consistently have employee appreciation and engagement events. I don’t need to worry that if I need office supplies for my job that I’ll have to buy them myself due to budgeting or whatever. I can’t say enough good things about this company. They have changed my life in the most profound way.', 'Extremely great benefits with a competitive pay. They hire great people to work with (associate level). Volunteering opportunities are great if you’re interested, and the facilities are fabulous and kept extremely well.', '1) Quality department has good managers. 2) Engaging consequential work that has me looking forward to work days 3) Excellent benefits, including healthcare. 4) Very diverse workforce of people who care. 5) Company is growing. 6) Reasonable conversational interviewing process.

Problems are not addressed, good work culture is lacking, and room for growth is nonexistent due to trapping employees with science degrees in a manufacturing department not doing anything science related. The billion dollar company does not compensate the MFG/CTS department for working 365 days a year. Administration gets a full week off in July and a full week off in December for Christmas and NYE and day, while the MFG department works on holiday with NO holiday pay or compensation - nor are the days that are scheduled off for administration comped for MFG employees. MFG works 10 hour shifts but is only given 80 hours for sick time a year, after that they have to use their own PTO time for sick days/any form of time off because it is not offered otherwise. That means 8 days out of 365 are you allowed to be sick. PTO is only accrued biweekly - and low and slow for entry level positions. Leadership does not lead, only bosses employees. Associate CTSs are micromanaged and bossed around/treated like children.', '1) Long onboarding. 2) Rigid IT requirements that prevent flexible software work. 3) Lower pay band than big tech, though this less an issue with the company itself and more a larger biotech/pharma space issue. 4) Some office locations mean housing cost difficulties.', 'As of now there are no cons.', 'HR support is simultaneously nonexistent and hinders performance management']"
