Postdoc Recognition and Acknowledgement to Strengthen Equality | RAISE project,"Important: It is also possible to combine it with a similar postdoc position advertised for this project at KU Leuven (3 years, 50%)

Structural racism exists because of social constructions of group demarcations. Such boundary making processes are at the root of both structural and individual xenophobia and racism.


This project aims to:
empirically map boundary making processes in people’s everyday life institutional contexts;
provide empirical evidence in what actions as a response of boundary making processes will support equality.
RAISE draws on the assumption that to reduce structural racism, people (and the institutions they operate in) have to be aware of these underlying boundary making processes that reproduce structural racism and the role it has in lasting inequalities. Recognition and acknowledgment of these forms of injustice will contribute to social action for equality. The project will be the first in Europe to study the awareness of boundary making processes in reproducing structural racism and what collective actions contribute to break through such boundary making processes to reduce structural racism.

By taking an interdisciplinary approach (from geographers, big data scientists, social psychologists, theologists, political scientists, economists and sociologists) and by creation of research in collaboration between NGOs that address racism and xenophobia operating in precarious contexts (NGOs from Hungary, Poland and Turkey) and academics, this project is at the front of generating new insights on structural racism in Europe.

This vacancy calls for applications for a postdoctoral position in Work Package 1 of RAISE:
Objective: RAISE studies a variety of minority and majority groups, but it is aware that this risks reinscribing discursive boundaries that define these groups, rather than critically analysing how these groups are constituted. The goal of WP1 therefore is to develop a theoretical and conceptual framework that explicates the conceptual complexities that are at stake in studying minority groups and structural racism and xenophobia, based on an ethnographic study of the practices and narratives of boundary-making that constitute ‘majority’ and ‘minority’ groups in institutional settings in Europe.
Approach: In this Work Package, the successful candidate will collaborate with three other postdoctoral researchers to conduct in-depth qualitative ethnographic research (observation and interviews) in four countries (Belgium, Hungary, Poland and Netherlands) around the topic of parenting encounters (interviews with and ethnographic observations of parents, care-givers and teachers at care centres for new-born babies, schools). He/she will bring the results of these empirical studies into dialogue with existing literature in order to synthesize them into a complex understanding of boundary drawing: WP1 aims to develop a theoretical framework of core concepts for the subsequent WPs of the RAISE project.
The successful candidate will:
perform independent research within a collaborative research team (qualitative and theoretical research), preference for someone with ethnographic experience;
deliver written reports of their research on a regular basis;
cooperate with NGO partners to publish a practical handbook for day-care centres and schools on how to deal with diversity;
participate in, and contribute to, scientific meetings and present their research to the research consortium of RAISE.


Profiel We are looking for a highly motivated, enthusiastic, critical and creative individual to join the research team. The candidate should have experience in social-empirical research and/or a humanities background in minority studies.
You hold a PhD degree by the start of the position (humanities or social sciences).
You obtained outstanding academic results.
You are interested in interdisciplinary research and have strong analytical skills.
You speak Dutch and have an excellent command of English.
You are willing and able to collaborate with other researchers.


Aanbod You will be offered a temporary position (0.5 FTE), initially for one year with an extension to a total of three years upon a successful assessment in the first year, and with the specific intent that it results in a doctorate within this period. The gross salary - depending on previous qualifications and experience - ranges between €2,960 and €4,670 (scale 10 according to the Collective Labour Agreement Dutch Universities) per month for full-time employment. Salaries are supplemented with a holiday bonus of 8% and a year-end bonus of 8.3% per year.


In addition, Utrecht University offers excellent secondary conditions, including an attractive retirement scheme, (partly paid) parental leave and flexible employment conditions (multiple choice model). For more information, please visit working at Utrecht University.

You work in a global team of economists, analysts, and strategists with a pleasant, cooperative and result-oriented working environment.
The role requires you to work engage with colleagues internally, sometimes in peace and quiet with a clear schedule, but regularly to do ad hoc jobs or be faced with sharp deadlines.

In het kort

Begeef jij je op het kruispunt van economie en data-analyse? Heb je ervaring met het analyseren van de woningmarkt? Jouw kennis van de Nederlandse woningmarkt en data-analyse maken je een belangrijke schakel binnen de bank in een wereld die nooit stilstaat. Een uitdagende functie voor een enthousiaste woningmarkteconoom. Je doet zelfstandig onderzoek, bereikt de media en je draagt bij aan het inzichtelijk maken van de prijs-, en transactie- ontwikkelingen op de Nederlandse woningmarkt. Je bent in staat om innovatief en creatief op zoek te gaan naar nieuwe methodes en data waarmee je vraag en aanbodfactoren doorgrondt en voorspelt. Data-analyse en programmeren zitten standaard in jouw gereedschapskist. We zoeken een uitdagende en ondernemende denker die de klassieke woningmarktanalyse op een originele manier aanpakt! Geïnteresseerd? Vertel ons jouw verhaal. Wij zijn benieuwd! Als je goed bent, kun je bij ons nog beter worden. Dat beloven wij je. Dit is je kans om de professional te worden die je wilt zijn.
Je werk

Je analyseert de Nederlandse economie en de gevolgen van het overheidsbeleid voor de woningmarkt. Je gebruikt daarbij micro-economische hoogfrequente data en kunt hieruit patronen en voorspellingen van de huizenmarkt afleiden. De veelheid van factoren die rondom de woningmarkt spelen, stelt je ook in staat om over meer thematische onderwerpen zoals toegang tot wonen, ongelijkheid, financiële weerbaarheid en macro-economische instabiliteit te schrijven. Dit zijn sociaal-economische thema’s waaraan de bank zich verbindt in haar strategie ‘Banking for Better, for generations to come’.

In het Nederland-team werken we veel samen aan onze gezamenlijke onderzoeksagenda. We publiceren met grote regelmaat en geven commentaar in de media, maar ook bedienen we het senior management van de bank met onze inzichten. Ten slotte leveren we scenario’s en ramingen voor toezichtactiviteiten zoals stresstesten aan voor het risicomanagement van de bank. Om optimaal gebruik te maken van de grote hoeveelheden data die wij als bank bezitten, zijn programmeerkennis en tijdreeks-analytische vaardigheden een vereiste. Voor deze projecten werk je ook samen met collega data-analisten van de data-science-afdeling. Met jouw research help je het externe profiel van de bank als thought leader te versterken. Je geeft regelmatig presentaties binnen en buiten de bank. En jouw visie wordt gretig opgepakt door de pers. Jij publiceert frequent, zelfstandig en onafhankelijk, maar je laat je wel uitdagen door je collega’s. Het Nederland-team maakt deel uit van het Economisch Bureau, waar in totaal ca. 20 mensen werken. De sfeer is informeel en de lijnen zijn kort. We zijn een hecht en energiek team. Kwaliteit staat hoog in het vaandel. Er is een goede balans tussen individuele prestaties en teamwork.
Werkomgeving

Het Economisch Bureau maakt deel uit van het bedrijfsonderdeel Strategie & Innovatie (S&I). We doen economisch onderzoek voor de hele bank en al haar klantengroepen. Onze research is onafhankelijk, maar we werken nauw samen met andere bedrijfsonderdelen. We bedienen naast het senior management van ABN AMRO alle klantgroepen van de bank op een effectieve manier. We doen dat door prioriteiten te stellen op basis van het bankbelang. We streven naar optimale waardecreatie voor de bank en haar klanten. We worden gezien als originele denkers en experts in ons vakgebied en willen ons daarmee onderscheiden van de concurrentie. Binnen het Nederland-team wordt onderzoek gedaan naar de Nederlandse conjunctuur, naar de woningmarkt, de arbeidsmarkt en naar duurzaamheidsvraagstukken. Daarnaast publiceren we regelmatig over actuele thema’s, vaak samen met de sectoreconomen die bij Corporate Banking werken. Denk aan onze studies over de krapte op de Nederlandse arbeidsmarkt of aan de gevolgen van de stikstofcrisis voor de economische groei.

When your energy dips, you remember who you are reaching and pick back up\r\n- global, diverse team. I now have buddies in countries all over Africa and have been over to visit more than once\r\n- FAST PACED. This nonprofit is more rigorous, focused, and fast moving than the for profit places I've worked. You aren't signing up to snooze or sit on decisions, which was my big fear coming in\r\n- very smart coworkers. analytic, well rounded, funny. it's a great crowd.\r\n- comp is better than you'd expect and very transparent"", 'I gave this review a lot of thought and will try to share as balanced of a view as I can about what it\'s like to work here.\n\nThere are many positives to working at GD:\n\n- People: as other reviews stated, the people at GD are brilliant and kind (often a rare combo). Even though everyone has a full plate, colleagues are happy to collaborate and support with projects outside the scope of their work, within reason of course. \n\n- Flat org structure: Leadership is accessible and good at sharing ""air time"" during meetings. My encounters with leadership have always been positive for the most part.\n\n- Culture and values: GD takes its culture seriously. We have a ""people"" team that provides many opportunities to get staff input on initiatives and solicit feedback on culture. Though it\'s still a work in progress (see cons), I am heartened by the org\'s demonstrated commitment to building a strong, positive culture.\n\n- Mission: GD\'s mission is AMBITIOUS and a real example of effective altruism. Our approach to putting recipients first and respecting their right to choose what they do with their cash is unlike many other similar orgs, and I wholeheartedly think it\'s the way to go.\n\n- Salary is fairly competitive compared to other similarly-sized nonprofits', ""1. The people: best part about GD, whole team wants peers to succeed, and everyone (even people on different teams) goes out of their way to support each other. people are goofy, hard working, and understanding \n\n2. The culture: supportive candidness is highly, highly valued. teammates give descriptive criticism AND praise so you can usually tell if you're aiming in the right direction. communication is never accusatory, always productive"", 'High impact, evidence based work\r\nHigh ownership over work', 'Worked here for 2 years and loved it. Left to move into private sector, but would never want to work anywhere else in not for profit sector.']","[""- work creep is an issue. You govern your own hours + PTO, but the engine is always running and it's hard to dip out."", ""- DE&I/representation: There is a ton of work going on behind the scenes on moving the needle with respect to DE&I at the org. Staff participate in focus groups, the org has outlined clear goals, etc. That said, even though the majority of staff identify as Black and/or from the communities we serve, leadership unsurprisingly is mostly white. This has been acknowledged and I am eager to see more diversity and representation in leadership as the org grows.\n\n- Burnout: Similarly, work at GD can be hectic and cut into other parts of life. Some managers/colleagues are really good at managing this and setting boundaries, but lots aren't. GD often takes stock of which staff members are feeling burned out, but it's not clear what's being done about it.\n\n- Ambiguity: GD is more start-up-y than other traditional aid orgs, which is good if you like having a lot of ownership over projects and forging your own path. For others that might prefer more structure and preexisting systems, it might be a harder environment to adapt to."", ""1. Interviewing: didn't always know where I stood (i.e how many rounds remained, who I'd speak with, when I'd hear back from last interview)"", 'Challenging work life balance despite attempts to improve', ""It's hard to put down your laptop when you have a mission you believe in so the risk of burnout is higher than in most other jobs.""]"
