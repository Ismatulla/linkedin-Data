PhD position on recyclable polycarbonates by dynamic-covalent chemistry,"Do you have a strong ambition to develop polymer materials that contribute to a circular economy? Do you like working together in a large, multidisciplinary team to tackle an urgent societal challenge? And do you enjoy using organic chemistry to make new polymers with unexplored properties?
Then we are looking for you! We have a PhD position available in which you can develop polycarbonate polymers with dynamic-covalent functionalities that enable them to become better recyclable.

For a recently awarded research grant by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO), we are looking for a PhD student to come and join our consortium. This DynaBranch consortium consists of partners from Wageningen University, Eindhoven University of Technology, Avans University of Applied Sciences, with SABIC as industrial partner. The aim of the program is to increase the recyclability of an important class of engineering plastics: polycarbonates. For this, we will (chemically) modify polycarbonates by dynamic-covalent chemistry. These new polymers will be combined with existing polycarbonate (as part of a recycling stream) to achieve (re)processing that is compatible with existing infrastructure. The overall project will cover topics from organic/polymer synthesis, polymer processing and characterisation, ageing and recycling studies, as well as socio-economic analyses related to the acceptance of these new materials.

For this consortium we are now recruiting a PhD student in the Dynamic Polymers group of Maarten Smulders (www.smulderslab.nl) at Wageningen University. As PhD student, you will focus on how to integrate dynamic-covalent motifs in polycarbonates and characterise these newly developed polymers (additives). Specifically, you will unravel the dynamic behaviour of these new materials, including also as function of temperature. Moreover, the compatibility of the these newly developed ‘dynamic’ polymers with commercial polycarbonates will be explored. You will work in close collaboration with a second PhD student that will be appointed in parallel in the group of Hans Heuts at Eindhoven University of Technology (www.sijbesmalab.nl), and you will also spend time in Eindhoven. Finally, you will also work together with the other partners for further material characterisation, scale-up studies and industrial implementation.

The research is embedded within the chair Organic Chemistry at Wageningen University, which is led by Prof. Han Zuilhof. You will be supervised by Dr. Maarten Smulders.

Job description
The field of materials science is urgently in need of groundbreaking new technologies to enable sustainable fabrication of high-performance materials. Biomaterials in the natural world provide an abundant source of inspiration for the design and synthesis of novel materials. Most living organisms use elements in their environment to fabricate biominerals, from which a wide range are composites of calcium carbonate and biopolymers (eg., lobster shell, eggshell, nacre). In this project, the PhD student will produce composite materials composed of biominerals and biopolymers, arranged in a specific nano- and microstructure. Material characterization will then be performed to eventually reach a composite material that combines high stiffness, high toughness, fire resistance, etc. The advantages of using living organisms for high-performance materials fabrication include the high sustainability of the approach, the potential for self-repair, and the possibility to achieve material production directly ""on site"", outside of the factory. The PhD will work in a multidisciplinary team with the support of technicians and biotechnologists.
