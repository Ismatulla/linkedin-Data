PhD position TRansforming towards OPen and Inclusive Climate Sciences (TROPICS),"Are you interested in the way we produce knowledge on climate change? Are you curious about identifying what knowledge, and whose knowledge prevails within climate science, and how this shapes research practices, or influences policy options resulting from knowledge production? Are you able to work with different data sets and keen to explore the consequences of the underrepresentation of scientific data collection in tropical regions? Are you eager to collaborate with Global South partners to co-produce solutions to transform academic practices towards inclusive and open climate science?

At the Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development, we have a full-time four-year PhD position available to examine these questions. This position offers opportunities and expertise from both the Environmental Sciences and Environmental Governance sections within the Copernicus Institute. Through this research, the PhD researcher will embark on interdisciplinary research that aims to document the marginalization of climate scientists and knowledges from tropical countries in the Global South, while highlighting the importance of independent tropical data to support global assessments.

Specifically, the PhD researcher will systematically analyze geographical representation of tropical countries in the Global South in scientific knowledge production on climate science across the research cycle, from data generation to scientific analysis and publication output. Using a postcolonial conceptual frame, the PhD researcher will then identify the causes that explain the geographical imbalances in scientific knowledge production and shed light on the practices and legacies of coloniality in knowledge production. Geographical biases are also apparent in the relatively small number of measurement stations for studying cycling of carbon and water in tropical ecosystems. The PhD researcher will perform quantitative model analysis to assess the importance of these tropical measurements for better understanding the regional and global cycling of carbon and water. Finally, building on the analytical elements of the research, the PhD researcher will identify best practices for inclusive and open climate science.

The PhD researcher will be responsible for employing a mixed-methods approach, consisting of large-n quantitative statistical analyses and a pantropical multiple case study including countries from different tropical countries and with different levels of development. The aim of the fieldwork is to explore the local research practices for producing knowledge and identify barriers to open and inclusive climate science.

This PhD position will be based at Utrecht University, The Netherlands. The position includes extensive fieldwork in selected tropical countries in the Global South.

Profiel For this project we are looking for an enthusiastic candidate with an interdisciplinary profile, including a background in environmental or climate sciences and political science or a related field, and an interest in power dynamics within the production of knowledge on climate change. The PhD researcher should have experience with qualitative and quantitative research skills (interviews, content and/or discourse analysis, statistical analysis). Experience with (or an interest in)
programming (e.g., Python, R) is an asset.

We are open to candidates from different backgrounds with a broad range of skills; a strong motivation to learn new methods and do research in meaningful and authentic collaboration with Global South partners is important.

Fluency in English is required; fluency in one or several other languages (e.g., Bahasa Indonesia, Spanish, Swahili, Portuguese) is an asset. Preference will be given to candidates who have experience with Global South contexts, including organizing and conducting fieldwork. All are encouraged and welcome to apply and will be considered.

Aanbod You will be offered a temporary position (1.0 FTE), initially for one year with an extension to a total of four years upon a successful assessment in the first year, and with the specific intent that it results in a doctorate within this period. The gross salary ranges between €2,541 in the first year and €3,247 in the fourth year of employment (scale P according to the Collective Labour Agreement Dutch Universities) per month for a full-time employment. Salaries are supplemented with a holiday bonus of 8% and a year-end bonus of 8.3% per year.

In addition, Utrecht University offers excellent secondary conditions, including an attractive retirement scheme, (partly paid) parental leave and flexible employment conditions (multiple choice model). For more information, please visit working at Utrecht University.

PhD Artificial intelligence for tracking the politics of climate change adaptation,"Are you passionate about understanding the relationship between urban youth’s mental health, pro-environmental behaviors (PEB), and their environment? Do you want to be a part of a cutting-edge research project that addresses the urgent need to investigate urban youth’s mental health issues in culturally diverse contexts using data-driven approaches? Then this opportunity is for you!

We are seeking a highly motivated and talented researcher to join our multidisciplinary team investigating the relationship between nature exposure, mental health, and PEB among urban youth in diverse cultural contexts. Urban youth are experiencing increased stress, depression, and anxiety as they navigate a changing world affected by climate change and deteriorating planetary health. Studies suggest that nature exposure may improve mental health and stimulate pro-environmental behaviors, but previous research has been limited in scope.

This project will integrate high-resolution, longitudinal data on nature contact with cognitive and behavioral models based on the daily life experience of urban youth in different cities to explore these relations. You will investigate urban youths’ PEB and mental health in relation to nature contact in varying urban settings. The study will be conducted in two cities in the global south (i.e., Dhaka, Kampala) and one in the global north (i.e., Utrecht).

Key responsibilities include:
Integrating theories and methods from urban geography and environmental psychology to develop and test a new conceptual framework to connect nature contact, connectedness, mental health, and PEB;
Collecting and analyzing quantitative data from urban youth in multiple cities. This will include modeling dynamic nature exposure along activity spaces using GPS tracking, integrating different types of nature exposure metrics, and measuring spatially explicit nature connectedness using geographic ecological momentary assessment. Furthermore, you will develop measures to assess mental health, PEB, and mental models;
Investigating relationships between nature contact, nature connectedness, mental health, and PEB analyzing the collected data using different modeling techniques, and testing if the pathways of these relations are moderated/mediated by individuals’ mental models about nature exposure and nature connectedness.
The findings of this research will contribute to creating and implementing effective policies to improve mental health and stimulate pro-environmental behaviors among urban youth using nature-based solutions and interventions. This is an exciting opportunity to contribute to a growing field and make a meaningful impact on the future of global sustainability.

Profiel Essential knowledge, skills, and experience:
Successfully completed MSc degree in any of these subjects: Geography, Social/Environmental psychology, Environmental Science, Urban planning, or related subjects;
Clear understanding of quantitative research methods, demonstrated through grade transcripts and CV;
Practical experience with quantitative data analysis (using Python, or JAVA, or R);
Excellent knowledge of managing spatial data in GIS Software/database or in the programming environment;
Excellent command of the English language (both written and oral);
Excellent writing and communication skills, demonstrated through a writing example such as your Master thesis;
Able to work independently and in a team, excited to be working in an interdisciplinary team;
Willingness to travel to case study sites and conduct fieldwork as needed.


Desirable knowledge, skills, and experience:
Experience in topics related to urban environmental issues, including the built environment, greenspace, mobility, mental models, mental health, and PEB;
Experience in developing a manuscript for publication or publishing as the lead author, a conference paper or international peer-reviewed journal;
Willingness to acquire new skills as required for the research of the PhD project.


Note: You do not need to fulfill all of these requirements perfectly; make sure you address which ones you do in your motivation letter.

Aanbod
You will be offered a temporary position (1.0 FTE), initially for one year with an extension to a total of four years upon a successful assessment in the first year, and with the specific intent that it results in a doctorate within this period. The gross salary ranges between €2,541 in the first year and €3,247 in the fourth year of employment (scale P according to the Collective Labour Agreement Dutch Universities) per month for a full-time employment. Salaries are supplemented with a holiday bonus of 8% and a year-end bonus of 8.3% per year.
