Postdoc position in the Classical roots of,"Applications are invited for a fully funded two-year Postdoc position within the research project Classical roots of (early) modern colonization at Groningen University (UG) and the Royal Netherlands Institute in Rome (KNIR), coordinated by Prof. dr. Tesse Stek and Dr. Jeremia Pelgrom.

As we see vividly in the current newspapers, colonization and its impacts form one of the most defining forces in human history. As such, colonization has been a crucial phenomenon in the making of the modern globalized world. Although the impact of colonization on the modern world order is well known, and is currently object of fierce academic and societal debate, the deep historical roots of colonial ideologies and practices have remained underexplored.

Recent colonization studies on the impact and organization of colonial rule, and on the ideologies that have shaped these practices, show the long history and resilience of colonial paradigms. Ultimately, these paradigms originate in classical antiquity. Classical models of colonization, themselves manifold and pluriform, thus continue to shape the organization of the modern world – both implicitly and explicitly.

The project Classical roots of (early) modern colonization aims to shed light on this intricate relationship between the classical past and the (early) modern world. The project is organized as part of the Caput Mundi initiative between the University of Groningen and the Royal Netherlands Institute in Rome. Caput Mundi aims to intensify the connections between UG and KNIR and its international network. By focusing on interdisciplinary research, Caput Mundi broadens the research community that profits from the KNIR and establishes connections between different UG faculties and departments. Within the context of the Caput Mundi network, research themes are developed. The Classical roots of (early) modern colonization program is the first theme, and will run for 5 years. It brings different scholars together that are currently working in different departments and faculties, in particular archaeology, ancient history, classics, American studies, Roman law, international studies and religion studies, and more may follow.

The research theme group is reinforced by establishing a Postdoc position funded by the KNIR – UG collaboration impulse. The Postdoc will work on the use of classical themes in premodern and modern colonization and colonialism. He/she will make use of the KNIR to access the invaluable libraries, archives and expertise housed in Rome’s (foreign) institutes, universities and museums. The primary research questions revolve around the historical choices that were made as to which classical examples were to be developed further as a basis to build, understand or justify contemporary colonial societies, and which ones were instead to be ignored. Departing from various strands in the conceptualization of colonization in the classical past, case-studies are developed across the globe. In particular, the reception and use of Roman colonization in the pre-modern and modern Americas, and in Indonesia will be the object of study by a multidisciplinary team.

The project: Classical Models in Dutch Colonial discourses
The postdoc project is expected to employ an intellectual history perspective on the ideologies and practices that shaped Dutch colonization in the East (e.g., modern-day Indonesia) and/or the West (New Netherlands/ Brazil, Caribbean etc.). Particular attention is devoted to the role of classical (i.e., ancient Greek and Roman) discourses and themes that influenced colonial policy makers and communities in shaping their settlements and their relations with their mother-city and the surrounding communities. The postdoc project takes a broad/conceptual/ critical approach to the influence of classical ideology and texts in (early) modern colonization by the Dutch.

You will be asked to:

propose a relevant and well documented research strategy
write (co-authored) A rated journal articles
do archival research in Rome
co-supervise PhD and MA research projects
co-manage the research network and (co-)organize research, didactic and outreach activities within the Classical roots of (early) modern colonization progra
contribute to the acquisition of further funding for the continuity of the research program
participate, limitedly, in the teaching program as part of the regular curriculum of KNIR.
Qualifications
a relevant PhD in history, classics, or another related discipline
a strong international research profile and network
high impact publications
demonstrated interest in conceptual and theoretical aspects of colonial discourses
an independent, proactive work ethic and experience with autonomous archival research in e.g., Rome, the Vatican and other relevant archives
a flexible, mobile and internationally oriented mentality
excellent academic writing skills in English
(at least) passive knowledge of Italian and other relevant languages.

FTE: 0.8 - 1
Job description
This position will contribute to inclusive, fair and sustainable innovation in the health and life sciences, by addressing sector and industry challenges related to innovation and business models. In the biopharmaceutical industry, there is increasing attention for innovation deficits in the market that may be related to significant system and market failures associated with established dominant business models. Such innovation deficits not only relate to financial metrics, but more importantly also result in failures to deliver on society’s most pressing unmet needs. While current business models have become dominant as they reflect the most efficient way to use the resources available to capture and deliver value, they have not been optimized for delivering societal value. Novel, sustainable business models can more adequately deliver on unmet societal needs, and enable transformation of the current innovation system into a sustainable new configuration that adequately addresses and balances people, planet and profit dimensions.


Your duties

Your research approach should be collaborative, with the aim of studying such innovation system challenges and contributing to the sustainability of innovation and business management in life sciences. You build upon proven insight into emerging science and technology that could be the starting point for such system transitions, and an understanding of the valuation and appropriation of tangible and intangible value. In addition to qualitative analysis of sustainable business model dimensions, you will build on the capacity for empirical research and quantitative analyses to fundamentally support this line of research as well as complement and extend the Athena Institute’s research portfolio.


Research at the Athena Institute includes transdisciplinary approaches that involve issue-identification and the exploration of solutions developed in collaboration with actors and stakeholders. The Athena centers its research around four research themes: Emerging science and technology; (Global) health and well-being; Nature, agriculture and environment; Competency development in inter- and transdisciplinary research; and History of knowledge. The successful candidate should be able to build upon proven insight into emerging science and technology and is expected to collaborate with different colleagues in projects across these research themes.


Requirements
A PhD in Management studies, innovation studies, or a related (inter)discipline; an additional background in the health and life sciences is a strong plus;
Fluent in English (and knowledge of Dutch);
Strong and relevant publication track-record, complementing and extending the Athena Institute’s research portfolio, specifically in terms of quantitative analyses;
Teaching experience (e.g., as course instructor, thesis supervisor, etc.);
A university teaching qualification (BKO) or commitment to obtaining it during the tenure track;
Strong collaborator within interdisciplinary teams (listening, flexible, adaptive, pro-active);
Experience with applying for research grants and externally funded projects and ability to meet deadlines and produce deliverables;
Entrepreneurial and relevant business experience;
An (inter)national network relevant to the research lines.

What are we offering?
A challenging career track position from Assistant Professor 2 to Assistant Professor 1 in a socially involved organization.

We offer 2 types of contract. For candidates already living in the Netherlands, we offer a permanent position after 18 months, after a successful evaluation in your 15th month. After a successful evaluation, a path will be outlined for future academic development.

Join the Groups of Public Building and History of Architecture and Urban Planning to investigate new building types for healthy environments through data-driven design processes.
Job description
The Group of Public Building with the Group of History of Architecture and Urban Planning is inviting applications for one PhD position in the Department of Architecture to explore the theme of developing data driven spatial scenarios for healthy public buildings and environments. This is a research position for 4 years, funded by the Sector Plan Design Engineering Science. You will develop your own research under the guidance of the scientific staff in the groups of Public Building and History of Architecture and Urban Planning.

As stated by the 2030 UN-Habitat Agenda for Sustainable Development with its 17 goals, designers are urgently required to rethink the way architecture and the urban environment can be conceived and built, by taking into consideration not only new paradigms – see the concept of resilience from an economic, social, and environmental viewpoint, but also the usage of new data driven research and design tools as well as more sustainable building methods. In line with the concept of climate justice, sustainable solutions need to include all aspects of health and well-being. Many of contemporary challenges in health are a result of decade-long policies on working and living. It is time to use research-based design as a decisive factor for reducing the spatial and social inequalities that characterize the built environment.

The selected PhD candidate will collect relevant data on the design and construction of healthy buildings, taking a long-term perspective. This data research will facilitate understanding of complex spatial, social and cultural conditions that have deep historical roots and are often embedded in path dependencies. The PhD candidate will develop a scientifically balanced method for improving the quality of the living environment to future use through creative (re)design. They will work closely with the scientific staff to interpret the data needed for a comprehensive assessment of public health as a foundation for data-driven design interventions. Design of environments and spaces based on long-term investigation on health can stimulate the creation of healthy spatial conditions as the foundation for the design disciplines to confront new urgent problems: climate change, increasing inequality, limited access to resources and public health.

In support of the research-by-design method under development by the Group of Public Building and in line with the long-term exploration of the Group of History of Architecture and Urban Planning, the PhD candidate will investigate new spatial and typological articulations – buildings that can act as social catalyst for entire urban areas and that can improve quality of life collectively. In considering design as a decisive factor for reducing the spatial and social inequalities that characterize the built environment, the Groups of Public Building and History of Architecture and Urban Planning at TU Delft aim to implement an educational and research model that embraces cooperation, along with experimentation and digitalization with a focus on health in public buildings and spaces. The successful candidate will also be required to contribute to teaching programs of the Groups.
Requirements
You have:

Completed an MSc degree in Architecture, with a focus on Architectural Design;
Awareness of and interest in long term developments;
Previous experience in data-driven projects, as well as in coding, scripting, and artificial intelligence, preferably with an awareness of space-based processes;
Familiarity with spatial data analysis, the use of geographic information systems (e.g. ArcGIS) and 3D modelling (e.g. BIM);
Familiarity with research by design and data-driven design processes for example with software programs like Rhino, Revit, Grasshopper;
Excellent Master study results;
Previous research experience in a transdisciplinary setting;
Ability to work collaboratively with others (students, faculty, and staff) to create a supportive research and learning environment.

It is nice if you have:

At least 2 years of experience with working in a design office for architecture and/or urban design.

Doing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and a final thesis.

Develop data-enabled system and control co-design algorithms, synergizing control theory with novel machine learning techniques, to reinforce the performance of future-engineered systems.
Job description
In the last decades, the classical control theory has proven its effectiveness in terms of analysis and control (design) methodologies. Control theory has been a key enabler in the realization of complex systems. However, increasing system complexity leads to an increasingly indirect relationship between linear to practically meaningful performance. Moreover, the intricate requirements for system performance complicate controller design through the sole use of the classical control theory. Synergizing established fundamental control with promising data-enabled machine-learning techniques could effectively solve these present-day design challenges.

You will develop algorithms to effectuate efficient data-enabled systems and control co-design approaches. Therefore, you will tightly synergize the established control theory with novel data-enabled techniques from the fields of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). This allows for the design and efficient calibration of the system and controller in unison.

The algorithms that you develop will be applied to wind turbines, both in simulation and experimentally on lab-scale wind tunnel set-ups. The application area is highly relevant, as wind turbines see a rapid increase in system complexity. Next-generation large-scale wind turbines are becoming ever larger with increasing performance demands to satisfy the net-zero emission targets. This size increase leads to greater complexity through dynamic interactions. The exponential growth of data from wind turbines motivates the development and application of novel co-design techniques to achieve next-level performance, ultimately lowering the costs of renewable energy.

You will join our data-driven control research group, which is part of the department of Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC) of the faculty of Mechanical, Maritime, and Materials Engineering (3mE). At the DCSC, our mission is to conduct fundamental research in systems dynamics and control, involving dynamic modeling, advanced control theory, and optimization. Our group has a strong history in control for wind energy, with a strong impact through practical applicability.

Techniques that are actively used in our group are classical control theory (i.e., observer/control design, frequency domain analysis, loop-shaping), machine learning (including Gaussian processes and neural networks), (first principles) system modeling, adaptive and learning control, system identification, and multivariable control.
Requirements
This position is perfect for you if you possess profound knowledge of system modeling, system analysis, and (classical) control engineering, and when you have experience with or special interest in ML/AI techniques.

You will have ample space to display your auto-didactic skills and independently conduct ground-breaking research. You have a strong research-oriented attitude, good communication skills, and the ability to transfer knowledge and effectively present your challenges and results. Also, you are willing to grow as a positive (graduate) student supervisor. Working from elsewhere is permitted, however, there is a requirement for being present at least four days per week at the TU Delft faculty.

You also have:

An MSc in systems and control (control engineering), mechatronics, mechanical engineering, aeroelastics, machine learning, or a related field.
Excellent programming skills in MATLAB/Simulink.
Excellent command of the English language.

Make sure to apply when this position does spark excitement in you. If you do not tick all the boxes but are in possession of a profound understanding of control engineering, we’d definitely like to get to know you!

Postdoctoral researcher on viral manipulation of insect behaviour,"Are you an ambitious researcher eager to unravel the mechanisms underlying viral manipulation of insect behaviour? Do you want to join an ambitious, international research team to find answers to fundamental questions in virology and entomology? Then this postdoc position might be of interest to you.

You will join the Laboratory of Virology at Wageningen University as a postdoctoral researcher, to study viral manipulation of caterpillar behaviour. Parasites, including viruses, are able to manipulate the behaviour of their hosts to increase their transmission probability. The goal of this study is to unravel the molecular mechanisms behind behavioural manipulation by viruses in insects, for which caterpillars infected with baculoviruses will be used as a model. Infected caterpillars climb to elevated positions prior to death, a phenomenon known as tree-top disease. In this project you will apply a transcriptomic approach to reveal differences in gene expression patterns between virus-infected caterpillars under conditions triggering (light) and non-triggering (dark) tree-top disease. These data will provide information about virus and insect signal transduction pathways and effector genes that lead to altered host behaviour. In addition, small RNAs will be sequenced to look into the role of micro RNAs (miRNAs). A number of differentially regulated genes or miRNAs will be selected for follow-up studies (including both molecular and behavioural analyses) to confirm and specify their role in parasitic manipulation. The project will also aim to investigate tree-top disease in multiple caterpillar-baculovirus systems, to identify possible homologies and infer the evolutionary history of viral manipulation.

This postdoc position is embedded in the group of Dr. Vera Ros within the Laboratory of Virology. Our research focuses on insect virus – host interactions. We study a range of RNA and DNA viruses in insects, focusing on virus-induced manipulation of caterpillar behaviour, covert (latent or persistent) virus infections in insects (related to insect mass rearing), virome identification of insects and biological control of insects using viruses. You will collaborate with other researchers in the team and within WUR and with colleagues abroad. Wageningen University & Research offers excellent terms of employment. A few highlights from our Collective Labour Agreement include:
sabbatical leave, study leave, and partially paid parental leave;
working hours that can be discussed and arranged so that they allow for the best possible work-life balance;
the option to accrue additional compensation / holiday hours by working more, up to 40 hours per week;
there is a strong focus on vitality and you can make use of the sports facilities available on campus for a small fee;
a fixed December bonus of 8.3%;
excellent pension scheme.
In addition to these first-rate employee benefits, you will of course receive a good salary. Depending on your experience, we offer a competitive gross salary of between € 3,413,- and € 3,557,- for a full-time working week of 38 hours, in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreements for Dutch Universities (CAO-NU) (scale 10). Initially, we offer you a one-year contract, which will then be extended with an additional year if there is mutual enthusiasm. Of course, we would be happy to discuss this with you if you have any questions.

Wageningen University & Research encourages internal advancement opportunities and mobility with an internal recruitment policy. There are plenty of options for personal initiative in a learning environment, and we provide excellent training opportunities.

The Laboratory of Virology is part of the Plant Sciences Group of Wageningen University and is situated at the Wageningen Campus. Currently, about 40 researchers, including technicians, PhD students and Postdocs are employed at the Laboratory of Virology and contribute to a lively, research-driven work environment. Research at the Laboratory of Virology is focussed at various animal-, insect- and plant viruses. Plant viruses form a major threat for crops and ornamentals and are often transmitted by insect vectors. Arboviruses are transmitted by insects as well and cause disease in humans and animals. Insect-infecting viruses on the other hand are pathogenic to insects, are used to control pest insects, and form a threat to insect mass production. Insect viruses are also in use biotechnologically to produce recombinant proteins for instance for vaccines. Our research concentrates on virus-host and virus-vector interactions, with special attention for defence mechanisms, viral evasion strategies, covert virus infections, biological control and host manipulation mechanisms.

We will recruit for the vacancy ourselves, so no employment agencies please. However, sharing in your network is appreciated. You are a curious and highly motivated researcher with a proven track record in a relevant field (see below). You also possess:

New Opportunities Group
New Opportunities brings the majority of our extensive breadth of technical expertise to ensure large scale transformation of education systems into one team. This team kick-starts new programs in new countries. Each member of the team is responsible for a core area of expertise, and then setting up all work and functions related to that expertise in the new program/new country. This includes putting all relevant policies, practices, systems and technology in place, and leading the hiring of the leader who will take charge of this work as the permanent lead for this body of work. This is NewGlobes SWAT team, with specialists brought together to solve the critical and urgent problem of launching a state or nation-wide new program. This team must work collaboratively, thrive in creating order out of chaos, and understand that proactive problem solving is a daily task. All members of this team should expect extensive travel to remote and underserved areas, and to be resident in 2 other locations per year, setting up new programs. When not deployed on starting a specific program, each team member will do work with the core technical team which he or she represents, to support special projects, deepen technical knowledge, and otherwise advance in the field. This team is critical to NewGlobe delivering on our shared vision of transforming the lives of 10,000,000+ children, and in so doing seeing peace and prosperity where we work.
Technology
Technology plays a critical role enabling us to provide transformative education at massive scale in highly resource constrained environments. This is one of the key elements that gives us the ability to deliver radically impactful programmes, creating brighter futures for a generation of children across the world each day. Technology spans several key functions, including Product Management, Business Intelligence, Software Development, and IT Operations.
About the Role
Technology at NewGlobe is a highly complex, vertically-integrated affair, with systems supporting an ever expanding range of functions and countries, and crossing between software development, business intelligence, IT operations, and logistics/supply chain. At the same time, our teams run lean and things change fast – governments make policy decisions that affect us, launching new territories is a frenetic affair, and we still need to evolve our core technology offering.
This role is about ensuring that NewGlobes investments in technology translate into rapid and reliable launches, appropriately localised offerings, and sustainable at-scale operations. To achieve that, it will require deep knowledge of the existing NewGlobe tools and processes, an exceptional ability to collaborate, listen, and communicate, and a passion for continuous improvement. Above all else, this role is about being a technologist who can be a fast-moving and utterly resilient problem solver, while simultaneously being obsessed with ensuring the scale and sustainability of our operations.
When deployed as part of a new launch, this person will be on-ground as the Technology representative in the cross-functional New Opportunities team, adapting and deploying the existing set of tools and processes and infrastructure to the local context, hiring and training the future IT Operations team, and generally doing whatever is necessary. To achieve that goal, this person will be supported by and oversee a small globally distributed technology team assigned to the launch, including staff from both software development and IT Operations. But it will also mean rolling up sleeves, doing systems administration, installing software, working with local vendors, and whatever else is necessary to make the technology go.
When not participating in a new launch, this person will be catching up on the latest developments within the Technology group and working to make the next launch better, faster, cheaper.
This person will report to the Vice President of New Opportunities, with a functional reporting line to the CTO. This person will be a member of the core Technology Leadership team, alongside directors owning the IT Operations, Software Development, Product Management, and Programme Management functions, respectively.
What You Will Do

Hire and on-board the IT Operations manager and team (up to 10+) who will take over operations post-launch
Support academics and leadership and development teams to provide tech support for teacher trainings for up to 10,000 teachers in first 3 months in-country
Manage the local hardware and infrastructure setup, under the oversight of the shared services IT Operations director, to ensure that support office infrastructure (internet, PBX, firewalls, domain controllers, etc.), IT assets (smartphones, tablets, laptops, etc.), and tech consumables (software licenses, airtime, etc.) are procured and available in a way that is timely, cost-effective, and consistent with established NewGlobe standards.
Build awareness and perform training around the existing technology toolset for the local teams, including new products or functionality that might not have existed in prior launches
Ensure the right balance between standardisation (including pushing back on local teams to adopt) and localisation (including pushing back on shared services teams to adapt)
Oversee the technology shared services teams assigned to a launch, including prioritisation of issues for resolution, necessary customisations, and the coordination of associated timelines and releases. Changes to software systems to be overseen by the shared services Software Development director.
Act as the single point of contact on ground for Technology during a launch, meaning communicating a clear and complete picture back to the Technology Leadership teams and also communicating information back from those teams to the local teams
Prevent shadow systems and misinformation from becoming embedded
Between launches, work with other technology departments and functions to improve future launches, including product strategy, software development, IT Operations, and business intelligence
Advocate relentlessly for - and personally embrace - the use of data and reports to drive facts-based and at-scale decision making

What You Should Have

Experience deploying and overseeing technology in low infrastructure and physically remote environments - limited or unreliable access to power, limited or unreliable access to network, difficult or slow to reach in person, and often using low spec hardware.
Experience that includes mobile applications and enterprise mobility management are a big plus.
Experience working across multiple teams and departments, especially in a globally distributed and matrixed organisation.
Strong project management skills, especially with both lean processes that are designed to work in rapidly changing environments and also with more formal structures designed for complex and well-defined projects

Assistant professor data based approach to health and liveable cities: long-term perspectives,"Job description
The Electronic Systems (ES) group within the Department of Electrical Engineering of Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) and Canon Production Printing are seeking to hire an outstanding EngD candidate within the field of Embedded Computer Vision.
Candidate
Canon Production printing develops high-end digital inkjet printer systems for the high-volume and graphic arts professional printing markets. In such printers’ high-resolution bitmaps are prepared for printing using a fast image processing implementation that is able to match the demanding data rate requirements of the systems. This image processing ensures that the prints are delivered with the best possible print quality and without any artifacts.
To ensure that the image quality targets are met, the image processing implementations are rigorously tested, both using offline tooling and by printing extensive test sets on real printers. However, finding artifacts is a challenge due to the bulk of data, and sometimes feels like looking for a needle in a haystack: Visually inspecting the output bitmaps that contain hundreds of millions of pixels is very labor intensive, as is looking for artifacts in big stacks of paper.
Canon Production Printing is looking at ways to improve the identification of print artifacts in image processing output in order to further improve the quality of our deliveries. One of the planned improvement steps is the integration of machine learning algorithms during regression testing as a way to help the developers identify print artifacts in the image processing output before the software is released to be integrated into the print engine software.
This EngD project will consist of deep learning algorithm development and recreation/simulation of image quality artifacts. To obtain training data for the machine learning, existing (mostly artifact-free) regression test-sets can be used. In addition, miscellaneous types of artifacts can be (re-) created by building past versions of the software, as well as by manipulation of input data to the software. Additional artifacts may be simulated by adjusting the image processing output bitmaps. The training data will be used to create deep neural networks with the goal of flagging test cases where the output is expected to contain artifacts. For this application, a good network should combine high processing speed with good classification performance. The resulting network will be integrated into the build and test environment to run during (daily) regression testing and automated builds, where it should flag the bitmaps most likely to contain image artifacts. These bitmaps can then be inspected further manually.
