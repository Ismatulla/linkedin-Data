#ClinicalOperations",https://media.glassdoor.com/sql/340439/rho-squarelogo-1519420885540.png,Netherlands,nan,RHO,"['The best part about Rho, by far, is all the great coworkers I had my first 7-8 years. It was truly a team environment with smart, dedicated, and hard working people. The benefits I had were nice, but I also worked here for several years and the longer you work, the better your benefits (more PTO, less out-of-pocket costs for health insurance). By the time I left, I had a pretty nice benefits package for me and my family. Rho boasts a strong culture when they hire you and they talk about their culture a lot. When it comes to my peers and the teams I worked with for most of my years there, I definitely saw this on a daily basis. When it comes to some of the CXO personnel and senior management, this changes a bit. They had a lot of leadership changes the last few years and they brought in a lot of people from outside the company, instead of promoting from within, which was kind of new for them. Some corporate values are really valued by leadership and others just feel like lip-service. In my opinion, the culture was much stronger and better pre-pandemic, pre-COVID layoffs, and pre-leadership changes. See the ""Cons"" for more on this.', '-Depending on which group you work in there can be the feeling of community\n-LGBTQ+ friendly\n-Will hire less experienced people so good for entry level job \n-Good amount of PTO (but you don’t get it up front)', 'Nice office space, some good people, okay benefits', ""People are smart and know what they're doing and business is steady\nWe feel like we're part of a team \nCalls with the CEO are positive and she seems supportive\nClosed during the holidays"", 'Intelligent teammates, driven leadership who demonstrate compassion for employees, flexibility to work from home or go into the office', ""My time at Rho was great, and my fellow team members were always extremely helpful and flexible. Christina in HR went above and beyond any time I reached out to her - I felt like she truly had my back. My manager, Karen, was hands down the best manager I've ever had. Both her and my director, Julie, led our team with the perfect balance of professionalism/motivation blended with compassion, always seeing the human side of every interaction. In short, anyone who joins this team will be starting the best job they've ever had."", '- Great colleagues \n- Flexible work environment \n- Opportunities to wear multiple hats']","[""Rho was already making big culture changes before COVID. When the pandemic hit, they immediately laid off a lot of staff (like the first month we went virtual). They said they layoffs were for financial reasons, and I sort of believe that, but they went on to have some of their best profits the next few years so it's kind of hard to think it was purely financial. Based on who they laid off, it also looked less like financial hardship and more like an excuse to cut people who weren't part of their revamped culture and identity. What was this new identity? It seemed to be less about putting people first and more about turning a sizeable profit. The charm Rho had when I started was it's relatively small size compared to other CROs and the family feel. When I left, it was all about how much money could be made and how much we could grow. The irony is that we were almost always profitable and the company had nice profit-sharing bonuses most of the years I was there. But evidently they wanted to be making more profit. Don't get me wrong, I have no objections to a company trying to perform better and improve their bottom line, but it came at the cost of losing some really great employees and people who had worked at the company for a long time in really important roles. A number of really great people were cut during the layoffs, but a lot of long-timers left of their own choosing in the years that followed. I've talked to a lot of former Rho employees, and many of them left for the same reason I did; they saw the culture shift and decided to leave. Essentially, the company started to look more and more like the other CROs I've been at. There was no real reason to stay just for the so-called culture when I could make more money elsewhere with essentially equally great people and strong culture. I thought Rho was special when I first started working there. Then, they kind of became just like everyone else in the CRO industry. The only problem is they still acted like they were different and special, when they really weren't anymore."", '-Bullying culture including management \n-Hiring of unqualified people\n-Management has no oversight (“flat structure”)\n-No path for promotion\n-No clear job responsibilities \n-No work life balance (even though they preach this)\n-If you do your job well you will get more work from others who don’t do their job\n-Low salary\n-Unpredictable bonuses\n-Multiple lay offs \n-Inconsistent processes that are not industry standard', ""A lot of bullying that gets buried by HR. They seem to be so in love with money that they'll risk the health of their workers for a buck. Don't work here if you value your mental and physical well-being. It may look good on the surface, but behind closed doors, it's horrific. A hostile environment for sure where truth is suppressed due to the culture of fear."", ""I've had better benefits elsewhere"", 'At times the amount of work exceeds makes timelines overbearing. Rho has improved by improving communication and getting extra help when needed.', ""It is difficult for me to come up with cons for working at Rho as opposed to elsewhere. As a smaller company, they may not always have quite as many resources as the huge CROs, but they have everything you need (and plenty more) and that is a trade-off I'd gladly take."", '- Stay clear of Federal sector of the business. As other reviews have stated, Rho really likes to emphasize everything is done the ""Rho"" way. Even if you have other experience to bring to the table, they don\'t care. It is a bullying mentality. Federal sector individuals are also very condescending. \n- Pay is VERY low compared to industry standards.\n- Lack of innovative applications due to smaller CROs which leads to you working longer hours to perform basic job function.\n- Lack of mentorship program and dedicated managers. Everyone is overworked at Rho where there is no dedicated time to professional development.\n-']"
