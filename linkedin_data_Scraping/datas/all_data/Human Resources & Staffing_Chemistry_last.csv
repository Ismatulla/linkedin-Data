The atmosphere at the office was always pleasant and colleagues were always open to help each other. We worked with team targets as opposed to individual targets, so it really felt like we were all working together for a common goal. The company also organised regular trainings to help employees improve their skills. The working hours were regular from 9am to 5.30 pm, and even though I would sometimes stay a little longer during busy periods of the year, it is by no means a company where you do a lot of over-hours.

Unaware of the market rates here in Netherland I trusted them but when I found our they were taking more than 40% cut I was furious. I explored more and this was their business model to hire expats at extremely low hourly rates. My advise to you is to research well enough before signing a contact with them. Also, they are not helpful and cooperative unlike so many other agencies I know now.', 'Undutchables is a very stable environment and since the offices are small there is not often opportunity to make career steps upwards. So if you are someone who is looking to make quick steps, it might not be the right place. That being said, if you are more interested in finding a company that offers you a lot of long-term stability and a job where you can learn a lot then it is a great place to be at.', 'There are no big things that bother me.
