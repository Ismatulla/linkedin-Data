In these activities, I have been responsible for the transcribing and interpreting of primary sources in order to assure their correct entry into the database as well as the writing and editing of texts with different purposes.

During my time as a student I combined two academic disciplines in the form of a double bachelor – History and Italian – supported by many extracurricular courses from other disciplines, such as philosophy and history of art. During the almost two years that I resided in Italy for education and an internship, I have been able to deepen my knowledge of the culture and language of the peninsula. Nowadays, I aim to improve my vocabulary of the Italian language in less colloquial areas, such as academic and literary jargon.

My internship at the Royal Dutch Embassy in Rome took place at a very important moment, namely the state visit of the Royal Couple to Italy. Therefore, during my work there, this was one of my most important activities. Next to this, I also conducted a research during these six months, aiming to find simple means of measuring the effect of the embassy’s cultural policy. Then, there were also a range of smaller activities I took care of, such as regularly updating the social media of the embassy as well as the publishing of newsletters.

In the three years that I worked as a student-assistant in a digitalization project, I was responsible for the entry of the documents in the database, from transcribing and correcting earlier transcriptions to the entry of the basic features and the writing of summaries.

In my free time I enjoy to read and collect literature, with special attention to the classics of (Italian) history. This includes both prose and verse, fiction such as novels, but also works on history and philosophy."

In 2019 I worked for six months as an intern for the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Department of Stability and Humanitarian Aid (Stability and Security Division). At the same time I wrote my bachelor thesis on Dutch Women in Peacekeeping Operations and UNSCR1325.

After I graduated and finished my internship, I decided to take a gap year and travelled from the Netherlands to Russia and from there overland to Australia. When I returned to the Netherlands I worked for the Dutch Ministry of Justice and Security, for the Immigration and Naturalisation Service.

I've started my MA International Law and Human Rights at the UN Mandated University for Peace in October 2020 and graduated in December 2021. For the last six months I worked as an intern for the United Nations, Department of Peacekeeping Operations (Gender Unit) in New York City, USA.

I am also a postdoctoral fellow at the Ecole des hautes études en sciences sociales. My first book, The Color of Equality: Race and Common Humanity in Enlightenment Thought, will be published by University of Pennsylvania Press in June 2021. It systematically interrogates the strands of equality and inequality, common humanity and racial classification, that run through Enlightenment thought, attempting to address the contradictory legacies wrought by the Enlightenment.

For me, history springs from the perennial human concern with self-discovery. While historical research and writing can never be completely shorn of its political nature, I believe that this work can also be considered an anthropological science which adds many layers of understanding to present-day problems. Scholarship in history can thus demonstrate the numerous ways in which our contemporary moment is a contingent one where our individual and collective choices matter."
