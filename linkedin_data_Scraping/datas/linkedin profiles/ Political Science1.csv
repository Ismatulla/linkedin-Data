I am interested in diplomacy, international politics and relations, and today’s Universal challenges such as climate change or refugees’ problem.
Throughout my secondary education, I’ve been able to develop a wide array of skills -participating in several Model United Nations in previous years aiding my debating skills. Furthermore, I have volunteered internationally in nations such as Spain and the Dominican Republic. These experiences broadened my horizons on key international issues that cause suffering globally and persist today. 
Personally, I define myself as a social character, who likes to meet new people from a variety of backgrounds. I am curious and like to develop new skills that can help impact the world in a positive way."

Critical thinking enthuses me, asking again and again: 'why'? I love social-scientific research, seeking for reliable and valid methods to increase our knowledge about the world. In this research, the perspective of those who are often not heard, who remain marginalized, is for me essential. In my own research, I have researched topics related to the securitization of migration, discrimination among higher educated migrants ('the discrimination paradox') and inequities in the global distribution of resources to combat COVID-19.

Education always gives me energy. To inspire students about various subjects, ranging from politics and social issues to music history, is one of the most amazing things to me. For me, the connection between teacher and student is always essential - to learn from each other.

Music also plays a central role in my life. Music can surprise, shock and leave you in awe. I feel driven to convey my passion for classical music to a young and old audience through lectures at the foundation 'Oud Geleerd, Jong Gedaan' and the young early music choir Ensemble Illustre."

I have always focussed on the representation of minors and want to make their voices heard. Through my willingness to engage in dialogue and clear presentation of ideas I am able to contribute to developments in all communities. 

I also enjoy focusing on my other passions, which are planning, cinema, and reading.

Let me introduce myself. I have a Master's degree in International Relations and I am currently living in the Netherlands. 

After high school, I decided to enroll in the Faculty of Political Science at La Sapienza (the university of Rome), as I was attracted by the multidisciplinary nature of the course Political Sciences and International Relations. This course taught me the fundamentals of law, (political) economy, sociology and philosophy and also formed me as a person by supplying me with all the necessary tools to understand today’s society, looking at it from different points of view. During the last year of my bachelor’s course, I was able to expand the specific skills that I already acquired in the international field. Exams such as International and European Law, Comparative Constitutional Law, Political Economy and the study of languages have fueled my desire to become an expert in the field of International Relations. For this reason, I decided to continue my studies at La Sapienza. In 2020, I obtained a Master’s degree in International Relations with honours. 

My greatest passion is to travel and get in touch with different cultures. During the Master’s course, I had the privilege to cultivate this passion: In 2018 I won a scholarship to study six months at the University of Applied Sciences of Amsterdam. During the minor International and European Trade Law, I learned how to solve complex legal cases and conduct legal advisory discussions. Thanks to the numerous presentations and the drafting of pleas and advisory opinions I improved my knowledge of the English language and further developed my (oral and written) communication skills. In specific, the course negotiation skills taught me how to evade conflicts in tense circumstances and to effectively communicate in a business context. Moreover, in 2019, I was selected by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to carry out an internship at the Italian Cultural Institute in Mexico City. This internship was a marvelous experience and a journey of personal and professional growth. I learned to work in a team, I honed my organisational and planning skills in order to meet the numerous deadlines and I found myself able to work well under pressure with little supervision.

After working as a Digital Marketing Specialist for Accenture, I am now working for Rabobank as a KYC Associate.

I was able to go on an exchange twice to the University of Glasgow (Scotland) where I followed classes from the sociology and the politics department. 

In 2019 I worked for six months as an intern for the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Department of Stability and Humanitarian Aid (Stability and Security Division). At the same time I wrote my bachelor thesis on Dutch Women in Peacekeeping Operations and UNSCR1325.

After I graduated and finished my internship, I decided to take a gap year and travelled from the Netherlands to Russia and from there overland to Australia. When I returned to the Netherlands I worked for the Dutch Ministry of Justice and Security, for the Immigration and Naturalisation Service.

I've started my MA International Law and Human Rights at the UN Mandated University for Peace in October 2020 and graduated in December 2021. For the last six months I worked as an intern for the United Nations, Department of Peacekeeping Operations (Gender Unit) in New York City, USA.

Recently I've returned to the Netherlands and started working for the Ministry of Justice and Security.
