Today, all our actions are influenced by digital technologies, and we cannot imagine life without.

My expertise is in design, visualisation and model making. Urbanism, sustainability, and technical detailing formed a key part of my projects, along with a personal interest in wooden structures and phenomenology in architecture. 

During my study I was a teaching assistant in drawing classes at two faculties, helping students with techniques of design by sketching and how to illustrate their ideas. I also did an internship, getting to try my hand at various stages in the design process, from drafting concepts to preparing models and presentation materials. I lived and studied in an international setting for most of my life. As such, I feel most at ease in novel situations and when surrounded by a diverse group of people, and I am comfortable working both independently and in a team. I enjoy learning languages and am fluent in English, Dutch, French, and Czech. 

Since graduating last year I indulged several side jobs to gain different experiences before searching for work in my field. I managed a campsite in the arctic in 2016, and at present work as a freelance graphic designer and writer. Creating graphic artwork for musicians has for me been an exercise in how to work with clients, and exploring the extent to which design skills can be transferred from one area to another. As a case writer in the area of business and economics, I gained confidence in my writing skills, and saw how a willingness to learn allows one to appropriate what at first seems utterly foreign. My work as camping manager, where I was the sole person responsible for all operations, was an invaluable experience in dealing with people and organising tasks. 

While currently freelancing, I am looking for opportunities to work for an architecture office. I can be reached via LinkedIn, email: Martin.F.Fiala@gmail.com, or at +31 6 39 82 30 87.
