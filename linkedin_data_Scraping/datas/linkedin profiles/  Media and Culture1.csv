Previously worked as a Professional Doctorate in Engineering (PDEng) researcher in University of Twente, Netherland. PDEng is a post master's research work which is mainly based on practical assignment and highly concentrated on design work. During the PDEng research, I gain experience related to project management, design methodology, Finite Element Method (FEM) calculation, FEM numerical simulation and systematic design approach. Moreover, the research work builds a bridge in between theoretical knowledge and practical implementation of analytical knowledge.   My research is run by Nonlinear Solid Mechanics group in UTwente and a company MAATS.

Earlier studied my master's study in Technical University of Dresden (TU Dresden), Germany, on Computational and Structural Engineering (named ACCESS). During the study, I learned computational methods in engineering and numerical simulation experience of different structural engineering. My engineering life started through the Bachelor studies in Bangladesh University of Eng and Tech (BUET),  in Bangladesh, adopting Structural Engineering as a major subject. 

Career goal: A position that requires analytical reasoning and creativity, where I can apply my academic knowledge effectively and efficiently. I am passionate about programming, design analyzing and improving, FEM calculation, FEM simulation and working with a new & challenging assignment. It is appealing for me to work in a friendly environment. Future goal is to establish me as an effective, professional and suitable engineer.

Key Skills: Experienced with
-  FEM calculation
- FEM analysis by ANSYS & ABAQUS
- 3D plasticity modeling by MATLAB, FORTRAN & FEAP
- 2D & 3D drawing software like SolidWorks, AUTOCAD "
