I believe that to solve global challenges, it is paramount to first think local and bridge the gap between the public, policymakers, researchers, and local communities all around the world. I strongly believe that understanding each other's perspectives and needs is what brings about positive change.

Thus I am looking for working experiences in the sectors of communications, press, advocacy, marketing, funding, or research."

Starting up as a communication leader, I had the possibility to lear basic communication manners in business, such as negotiation skills and promotion of a company. I continued my activities as the focal point of a newly set up daugther company, which led to the essential knowledge of a multinational environment. The complexity of this challenge allowed me to coordinate several fields of activities in the same time, providing a general overview about the basic procedures of a multinational. The main focus was commercial management and daily communication with customers. With evoving the company’s size, I also got the chance to contribute to redistribution of the tasks on management level. And as necessary contribution of tutoring the newcomers, continuous coordination and mentoring followed the enlargement in the coming years.

Due to changes in my location and professional career, I started widening my field of activities with learning psychology and practising art and dance therapy. Being a freelance interpreter at this period allowed me to harmonize the old and new fields of activities. After terminating the preparatory period on art and psychology, I turned back to the well known multinational area, and continued my secondary fields of activities in my free time.

Experience with governmental organisations, politics, and business community. 
Politically sensitive. 

After receiving the International Studies degree, I enrolled in the MSc World Politics and International Relations at the University of Pavia (Italy). This master served to broaden and deepen my international focus, integrated further with courses on diplomacy, migration, integration, law, gender issues, international relations, and social sciences. Furthermore, the wide range of electives allowed me to pursue new fields of interest, as well as to continue my language studies initiated at BAIS. 

I look back at my studies fondly, appreciating the general knowledge of (geo)politics, economics, and inter-cultural awareness the degree has given me, as well as the irreplaceable experience of going abroad to explore – and study in – China, Taiwan, and Italy. Both my Bachelor and my Master have encouraged my critical and analytical thinking, and have equipped me with research, social, and writing skills, but most important of all, an open mind and tireless enthusiasm.

While working at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, I worked closely with diplomatic missions and international organisations. I also took my first steps in (international) event organisation - including the multi-day Global Entrepreneurship Summit (GES) in the Hague. 

At Gemeente Hoeksche Waard I started further developing my knowledge of project-development. 

In the middle of the Ukraine-crisis, I started at Gemeente Nissewaard, and managed to turn the lovely chaos into a well-oiled structurally-sound shelter. 
I shouldered responsibility for everything including the refugee-locations and the Ukrainian refugees. From getting the locations ready for people during the crisis organisation, to keeping several locations with around 300 refugees running safely.

I look back fondly, and extraordinary pride, on the enormous responsibilities I have carried and what I have been able to establish so far in my carreer!

Currently working at Gemeente Midden-Delfland in the physical domain at the Location Development department."

Having taken courses at EUC ranging from behavioral economics to courses discussing the Frankfurter Schule, I have become well-versed in making new disciplines part of my own. Furthermore, I recognize the value they hold on their own and in an interdisciplinary discussion. Political decisions have direct or indirect effects on economic, social, and environmental aspects of life and through having taken a holistic approach I aim to be able to analyze the direct and indirect consequences on the aforementioned elements. In addition, at EUC I have developed further academic interests in the development of the African Union, Chinese sociopolitical involvement in Africa, the growing presence of international terrorist networks, and the relationship between food scarcity and conflict. I aim to complete my postgraduate studies in the field of conflict resolution, focusing on sustainable peace solutions and the rebuilding of countries through a developmental perspective. 

I have a fond interest in learning but also in the various ways in which knowledge is acquired. Outside of EUC, I am involved with Stichting Landmerk; a foundation that aims to enrich the Dutch high school and university landscape, offering lessons in rhetoric, philosophy, politics, literature, and law. I have been invited into their “teacher in training trajectory”, which is a weekly, 7-hour convention in which we discuss, amongst other topics, didactics. This topic continues to fascinate me and has allowed me to also take the perspective of the professor in my current classes. By furthering my capabilities and understanding within the field of philosophy, I am not just furthering my understanding of the interplay between philosophy and politics but also my ability to effectively and critically reason.

I am an incredibly motivated student as illustrated by my current full-time study while having been the Chairman of the Erasmus University College Student Association (EUCSA), doing internships, and being a teacher-in-training at Stichting Landmerk and aim to not only yield a productive output out of my courses but position myself within the academic discourse and actively engage with the material to make it my own."

Quotes like these sometimes tend to sound like oversimplified platitudes. Also, I won’t add ‘clairvoyancy’ as one of my LinkedIn professional skills. However, sayings like these have always inspired me to move forward in my endeavours and form a guiding principle throughout my (academic) career.

I am a passionate and ambitious master’s student with a special interest in International Relations. Especially the European Union, Human-Rights and civil society related subjects peak my interest. I love to delve into a regions culture to try and grasp an understanding of its current political and social dynamics. Factors that can potentially determine a regions bright future.

As a History of IR student, I have built a considerable frame of reference about the differences and historical origins of international identities. I know how to quickly analyse, contextualise current political events and get to the essence of complicated texts and policies to set up research.

Additionally, I have a total of four years of experience standing in front of full classes as a teacher in higher education. Aside from learning about the merits and flaws of education systems and its influence on citizenship. I developed essential public speaking, communication and management skills. I greatly benefit from these in academia, whether it concerns giving a comprehensive talk, leading or participating in a group assignment.

As recently as June 2021, I finished my traineeship at the SDG House/TRGConsultancy. Together with a multidisciplinary team we developed a didactically sound teaching module which focuses on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and world citizenship. In this programme I propelled my understanding of the international agreements regarding a more sustainable, peaceful, collective future even further.

Moreover, I want to build a stronger expertise regarding the multiple perspectives on international politics and conflicts. Therefore, you can imagine why I chose to do my second masters’ ‘Conflict Resolution in Divided Societies’ at King’s College London. I want to to take a deep-dive in how I can potentially help and bridge the divide.


I strive for a career in International Relations where I can delve into relevant socio-political problems and make a difference. I want to surround myself with experts from all different backgrounds, disciplinaries and walks of life so that I can challenge myself every single day.

I can’t wait to find out what the future holds!"

My master's thesis will explore the role of women in the European Parliament during the European Economic Community, focusing on ""The ‘missing’ women of European Integration"".

As part of my two-year degree, I am currently interning with Dr. Aline Sierp (Maastricht University) on a research paper about norm-building in memory studies. I am also a research intern with the Contested Histories Project by Euroclio, where I write reports on controversial monuments and street names. My experience with these internships is helping me to develop my analytical and research skills.

In addition to my studies, I am the head of the Marketing department of the European Careers Association Maastricht (ECA). As the marketing team leader, I work closely with my colleagues to implement our marketing strategy and promote ECA. I am also a German teacher at Belingual Maastricht, which allows me to share my knowledge and expertise with others.

During my Bachelor's degree in political science and social and economic history, I participated in Erasmus and spent time at Tartu University, Estonia. This experience sparked my passion for history and the European idea. I was also an active member of Model United Nations, participating as an organizer, delegate, or chair in more than 10 conferences during my Bachelor's. In my last year, I discovered a passion for Marketing, which I was able to explore through an internship with the Unicorn Factory. I was also part of the Model United Nations Society Göttingen, and in 2019, I organized the annual GöMUN conferences as deputy secretary-general. This role required me to fundraise €5000 from NATO, manage the conference logistics, and ensure academic standards were met.

In my free time, I enjoy attending MUN conferences, travelling, and reading various books, such as fantasy, romance, biographies, and LGBTQ+ literature. I am also part of the UM Pride Book Club and JEF. Spending quality time with my family and friends is also important to me.

Overall, my diverse experiences and passion for European Studies make me a valuable addition to any organization or team."
