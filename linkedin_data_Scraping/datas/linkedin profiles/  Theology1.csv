For 3,5 years I worked as Refugee Status Determination Officier at the Dutch Immigration and Naturalisation Agency (IND). The essence of my job was to ensure that those who had fled from persecution and serious harm received the international protection they needed. 

More generally, my interests lie in the fields of international humanitarian action & migration, peacebuilding, religion and human (LGBTI) rights. 

I have excellent skills in writing, analyzing complex information, creating and maintaining networks and building bridges between various fields, departments and disciplines. I like to look at the bigger picture and to travel off the beaten track.

---
My professional story, in brief, is as follows. 

After growing up as a Christian, I studied Theology (BA) in Amsterdam. The ethics and philosophy that filtered out of my Theology Bachelors led me into studying humanitarian action, conflict and peace-building (MA). 

The organization I interned at as part of my studies, the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, gave me a formidable sense of working at a larger funder and coordinator of humanitarian assistence.

I wrote my Master thesis about the political construction of 'Dutch Christian Self versus Migrant Muslim Other'. This made me more aware of the way violence and exclusion are legitimized in political discourse. 

I got the chance to witness dynamics of violence and exclusion in real life when, for two months, I volunteered at a farm in the West Bank owned by a Palestinian family. 

My volunteering job at the International Fellowship of Reconciliation gave me insight into the work of an international peace organization. Additionally, it  provided experience in applying for funding at the EU.

Furthermore, it was a great pleasure for me to volunteer at the Amsterdam Rainbow Dress Foundation, creating awareness on state sponsored homophobia. The Amsterdam Rainbow Dress is a work of art traveling around the world. I was part of a small team managing its exposition, and took part in fundraising efforts.

~~~

Striving to approach the world in a combined idealistic and realistic way, I am slowly becoming who I want to be. Someone whose presence and actions have a positive, transformative impact on the people I engage with. Someone who contributes to overturning unjust structures, making room for peace."

I am also a researcher but I am also passionate about my current job as a teacher of English language.

(Counselor, Coach, Professor and Pastor in Northern Virginia)

Professional Counseling & Pastoral Experience:

I worked for Liberty University as a full-time professional counselor for a couple of years. I also served among students at several different levels, including in financial aid advising, guidance counseling, and as Chaplain for International Students on a university campus. Alongside doing itinerant preaching and teaching in Churches in a wide spectrum of denominations across the U.S, Canada, and the continent of Africa during the past 15 years, I have also been actively involved in Biblical counseling for the past three years. As a regional pastor for Mclean Bible Church – where I currently provide shepherding oversight for 2,500 members and attendees – a significant part of my responsibility is the practice of Biblical counseling. My primary counseling areas of focus have been on helping distressed marriages, treating process and behavioral addictions, and emotional disorders such as anxiety and depression.

Professor/Teaching Experience:

Formerly an Adjunct Professor for Liberty University teaching psychology and counseling online and residentially, I currently serve on my side job as a Resident Adjunct Professor who teaches counseling in seminary at the Washington University of Virginia. In my 7-year teaching career, here are some of the courses I have taught: Multicultural Counseling and Research Issues; Introduction to Christian Counseling; Theories in Counseling and Psychotherapy; Psychology of Personality; a Psychology Internship Course; etc. I have also worked as a Teaching Assistant for Liberty University’s Associate Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. While serving in that office, I was involved in administrative duties such as course development, course edits, and the vetting and hiring of professors.
