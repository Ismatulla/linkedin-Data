Driven by my passion for the interesting world of physics, and supported by the eagerness to learn and a great amount of self-discipline, I was able to combine this football career with my scientific career for a long time. My particular interest in photonics, which was boosted by the internship experiences, translates into the desire to aid in the development and application of this promising field of physics."

The focus of my research at UU is the application of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to predict and understand geophysical processes. My ongoing case study is the desertification of semiarid hillslope ecosystems, in which I have applied different ML algorithms to simulate the aggregate behaviour of vegetation and soil, using data from spatially detailed simulation models. The results outperform previously used expert-based models, enabling an evidence-based analysis of the desertification mechanisms.

I am most proficient in Python (numpy, pandas, tensorflow, matplotlib...), but I am also well-versed in other programming languages such as R and Fortran. In my master's degree in Applied Data Science, I have acquired a broad knowledge of Machine Learning including text, image and video analysis; the use of mixed models in epidemiology; geostatistics and spatially dependent models; deep learning including artificial neural networks and convolutional neural networks among others; network analysis, etc. 

My scientific background in physics and analytical mindset proves key to problem-solving, and I am always ready for a challenge. In my professional experience as a secondary school teacher, I learned to communicate efficiently and express complex topics in an easy-to-understand way. I have also had to cooperate extensively with my peers both in my studies and work environment, which I have been able to tackle with an open mind and respectful attitude. Working as a teacher while studying has also taught me to have good organization and time management.

In the future I would like to continue working on new applications of Data Science and Machine Learning, especially in Science, but I am also interested in other topics like Science communication or the ethics behind AI."

I am a first year master student Applied Mathematics and Applied Physics. I chose to do two masters because both subjects seemed genuinely interesting, and I wanted to challenge myself. In my studies the focus is quite broad at the moment, ranging from analysis and geometry to probability and stochastics for mathematics, and from quantum optics to special relativity and condensed matter for physics. 

At the moment, I am interested in opportunities that expand my horizons beyond what I already know. 

Please also have a look at my résumé, which can be found on this page."

My main interest lies in the mathematics behind theoretical physics, and subsequently how it gives rise to physical models. In 2021 I graduated cum laude for bachelors in applied mathematics and applied physics, where I did my bachelor's thesis in general relativity. Although my interest in mathematical physics is rather broad, mathematical relativity has a special place. I think general relativity is one of the most beautiful theories where the mathematics and physics support each other. As a master's student, I learn about mathematical physics every day and I would love to continue doing this by doing research in this field."
