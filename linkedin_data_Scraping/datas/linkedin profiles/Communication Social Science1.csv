As a cultural psychologist as well as a scholar of religion, my academic interests are scattered across both the social sciences and the humanities. They include religious and aesthetic experiences, mysticism, meaning-making, creativity, rituality and magical thinking, and also cultural transmission, evolutionary psychology, ecological approaches (embodied embedded cognition), identity construction, consciousness, religious self-legitimation, and human atmospheres.

I also have an interest in psychoanalysis, philosophy of science, theory and method. My research skills range from quantitative methods in general to qualitative ones—such as interviewing, participatory observation, and content analysis—in particular. I am currently involved in two research projects: one on religious self-legitimation (together with Leonard van ‘t Hul), and one on human atmospheres.

Teaching
I have extensive experience in teaching, developing teaching material, and coordinating courses in both the social sciences and the humanities (most notably cultural psychology, psychology of religion and religious studies). I have taught both undergraduate and graduate students at university and at the first, second, and last year at college (‘hogeschool’) level. I have taught regular students as well as adult learners and have done so in Dutch and English.

The teaching formats of the courses I participated in range from individual supervision (more than 120 undergraduate and graduate theses) to practicals, seminars (of 10-30 students), and lectures (up to 120 students). Apart from the development of course material, I have constructed and validated exams, edited readers, wrote syllabi and for several years coordinated two courses of some 450 students each. As part of these activities, I have supervised teaching assistants and junior lecturers and offered them didactic training, intervision sessions, and personal guidance in the form of class visitations and one-on-one coaching.

I'm Andrew and I am a Data Steward in the Faculty of Social and Behavioral Sciences at Leiden University in the Netherlands.

In this capacity, I spend much of my time liaising with researchers and support staff in Cultural Anthropology & Development Sociology (CAOS) and the Centre for Science & Technology Studies (CWTS) to address any and all Research Data Management needs – from assisting in drafting Data Management Plans, to choosing long-term data storage/archiving, assembling Publication Packages, or any number of other facets of RDM that social science researchers encounter in their work.

Additionally, I also work closely with my team of Privacy, Security, and Data Management experts in our faculty, as well as with colleagues at Leiden's Center for Digital Scholarship, to develop resources and tooling that will assist researchers and fellow RDM professionals alike in navigating the rapidly shifting and sometimes daunting landscape of new policies, protocols, and ever more forms to fill out.
 
In my previous lives, I've been a Research Data Coordinator in academic cancer medicine (NYC, US); completed a doctoral degree in sociology with a concentration in social studies of medicine (McGill University, CA); and worked as a (sometimes-competitive) oyster shucker in the great state of Maine. I've also held a couple of postdoctoral fellowships (University of Washington, USA & Radboud University, NL), where I was studying and working alongside sociotechnical infrastructure development projects, predominantly in the field of translational science & medicine. 

It is here that I gained a keen appreciation for the promises, difficulties, and overall hard work it takes to implement concepts like Open Science and the FAIR Data Principles in everyday research practices – both in the fields that I have studied, but also in my own work as an ethnographer of knowledge infrastructures. And it was an interest in confronting these challenges as an RDM practitioner, where I could help researchers and policymakers make sense of each others' distinct epistemologies (or whatever you call it), that led me to my current work as a Data Steward.

Beyond these pursuits, I love reading novels on my morning commute to work, watching tennis in the evenings, accumulating way more LPs than I'll ever have the time to listen carefully to, and seeking out lighthouses in distant corners of the world with the partner of my dreams and the kid for whom we share responsibility."

This program complements my interests in mental health from a preventative perspective and specific application of mental health promotion in the workplace. With my background in psychological research, I aspire to be able to translate research into usable interventions in the work environment. Aside from mental health, I am also highly interested in the use of psychology in the legal system. 

Next to my studies, I worked in the hospitality industry which taught me effective self-management, how to coordinate my duties at work and in my studies, and hands-on teamwork. Recently I had the honour to become the student ambassador of my study program, following my passion to help future students to find their academic path. 

In my free time, I am a very social and creative person, who enjoys creating. Over the years I taught myself how to paint, sew, knit and how to create digital art. Besides that, I value investing time into my self-development and becoming happier with myself each day."
