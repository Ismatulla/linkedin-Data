My own core fundamental research focus is on the design and application of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for single- and multi-objective optimization, and machine learning. The designed EAs are mostly model-based, meaning that a specific model is used to capture and exploit problem-specific features to guide the search for high-quality solutions more effectively and efficiently and get the most out of previously performed evaluations.
