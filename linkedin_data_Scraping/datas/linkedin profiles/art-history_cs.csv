She is active in the international art scene, having worked in Los Angeles, Berlin, London and Amsterdam. She has extensive experience on the commercial side of the industry, as well as on the more experimental and conceptual side of the art scene. 

In 2017 she founded Art Tours Berlin (www.arttoursberlin.com), an art tours and events company through which she organized a great number of art tours, events, talks and panel discussions. The company grew to 10 employees, with a strong presence in both the Berlin and London art scenes. Art Tours Berlin was passed on to new directors in 2020, and it continues to flourish. 
She then founded AXS ART (www.axs-art.com) in 2018, an online gallery for art by emerging artists, aimed at starting collectors. The goal of AXS ART is to provide greater access to art collecting, by bringing young art buyers and artists together via its e-commerce platform and Instagram, as well as through regular pop-up exhibitions.

Most recently, she organized the exhibition with an elaborate events programme titled ‘unity | duality | trinity’ at De School in Amsterdam. She is currently working on various projects as a curator and event program organizer. Furthermore, she is working on founding a digital artist residency that is scheduled to launch in the spring of 2023.

The projects she has led lie on the intersection of art and digital technology, presenting art in an interdisciplinary context, where the viewer/visitor is invited to explore how we as humans connect to each other and the world around us. 
Constance consistently aims to extend the access to art and the art world to a wider, more diverse audience, and create environments that are connecting and unifying in nature."
