I would have never expected I would grow as fond of the course as I did. I was previously more interested in working with people later in life. After graduating and finishing that course with an 8 as average, I knew I had to pursue this career. 

After plenty of research into different university programs, artificial intelligence was deemed the perfect fit for me. Combining my new found interest in coding and my never-ending passion for working with people. I am currently in my second year of this bachelor at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam after finishing the first year successfully. 

In the future, I would like to expand my knowledge about AI and robotics, together with furthering passions outside of professional life such as music, learning languages and art. "

As an all-round web adventurer and driven entrepreneur with an affinity for security and AI, I have extensive experience in all areas related to ‘World 3.0,’ and have worked with clients from all facets of society since the age of fourteen. My natural curiosity and research-oriented education put me on top of the most recent trends and developments within the field of Artificial Intelligence. I am especially intrigued by natural language (processing) and explainable AI, and my combined disciplines uniquely suit me for studying these areas. As an active participant in societal debate, I also got acquainted with politics and dealing with media.

While back home I enjoy the luxury of tweaking and hacking on my laptop, I also have a lust for traveling to extraordinary and controversial places like (post-)war zones and remote regions. Doing so, while mostly hitchhiking and at times having to cross dangerous borders and enjoy the support of privileged locals, I have reported on child prostitution, corruption, and outright poverty. I am especially inspired by the former Soviet region, and, through a second academic career and very extensive travels across the entire CIS region, I have developed a solid understanding of their cultures, histories, literatures, and contemporary societies. By predominantly staying with local residents, I developed numerous short-term relationships with people from all social layers: from high officials to poverty-stricken families. An ingrained interest in ‘the strange and unknown’ has brought me to many of the countries' (war) ruins, factories, biolabs, chemical (and nuclear) dumpsites, indigenous communities, and ‘off-the-beaten-path’ nature areas.

Although it might sound odd at first, perhaps my greatest achievement in life is that I expect to complete nine years of study (two Bachelor's degrees and two Master's degrees) within a nominal timeframe. I spent almost two years traveling abroad and lost both my father and mother at different moments in time (2016 and 2019). In the last three years of studying, I managed to catch up entirely by working up to twice the nominal load, all the while still maintaining a social life and various employments; without sacrificing my academic achievements."
