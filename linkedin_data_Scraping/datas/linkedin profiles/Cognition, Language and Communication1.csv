My focus in education is in developing critical thinking skills and scientific competence in my students, with additional concentration on clear communication and writing. I believe that students in secondary education are the best targets for developing strong scientific literacy, academic hygiene, and other characteristics that will lead to better outcomes at the post-secondary level.

My focus is on continuing to teach Psychology, ideally in environments that allow and encourage inquiry-based learning and the development of practical skills that will aid students in their later education. I am currently teaching Cambridge A Levels, but am excited to gain experience with IB and AP curricula. In addition to my experience with Psychology, I am strongly interested in the development of academic writing and research skills - to this end I have taught Global Perspectives, and organised extracurricular activities around conducting psychological research. This of course dovetails nicely with my extensive experience as a researcher in academia.

Collectively, I think these skills make me a unique educator in an underserved segment of secondary education. I am experienced and passionate about the development of young scientists, and also have a wealth of experience and knowledge about what is actually required to be successful in an academic context."

IVAs are artificial entities capable of behaving socially and engaging in natural conversations with humans. Relying on a mixture of methods, I studied how people perceive the appearance and behavior of virtual entities at both behavior and the brain level. While conducting research on IVAs, I also have had a unique opportunity to be part of the team contributing to the development of a virtual entity on the ViBE (Virtual Humans in the Brabant Economy) project, where I have learned about 3D scanning, language models, and behavior generation for IVAs.

In addition to my doctoral work, I am an active science communicator. I love writing and science, and I find interest in numerous topics, ranging from biology and the brain to technology.

My PhD focused on the perception of emotional body language and innovated the field of affective neuroscience that was characterized by an almost exclusive focus on facial expressions. I showed that the brain processes body movements similarly as facial expressions but initiate clearer action patterns. I argued that body language is evolutionary seen much older than facial expressions and inspired by Darwins work on emotions and by contemporary primatologists, I experimentally tested this statement in a group of chimpanzees at the Kyoto University Primate Research Institute. With use of the emotional dot probe paradigm presented on a touch-screen, I showed that chimpanzees process chimpanzee body language similarly as humans do. Thanks to the interactions with these beautiful animals, I developed an interest in the use of eye-signals. Humans are the only species on earth with much visible eye-white that evolved for communicative purposes. Despite this difference with the chimpanzee, I have shown that humans, as well as chimpanzees synchronize their pupil-size with their own species. 
My Postdoctoral appointment at the University of Amsterdam enables me to connect these earlier insights to social psychological work on social decision making and intergroup differences. It resulted in (co) authored publications on the substantial role of oxytocin in social approach and withdrawal tendencies. My VENI project (starting in January 2015) builds on these three lines of work â€“ emotion recognition and mimicry, pupil-synchronization, and oxytocin-motivated social decision making.

I attended my first Information Design conference in 1992 (London), my first CHI (Computer-Human Interaction) conference in 1993 (Amsterdam), and the very first InfoVis (Information Visualization) conference in 1995 (Atlanta).  My academic work has been quoted by Colin Ware, Stuart Card, Jock Mackinlay, Ben Shneiderman and other key authors in the field of information visualization. Over the years I have learned a lot from my personal face-to-face discussions with very inspiring scholars and mentors such as Jacques Bertin, Hans Rosling, Donald Norman, Nigel Holmes, Richard Saul Wurman, Barbara Tversky, Clive Richards, Alberto Cairo, and many others.  

I am passionate about the use of data visualization, information graphics and visual analytics in the context of social and environmental causes â€“ especially in areas such as the climate emergency, education, health, sustainability, environmental protection, human rights, transparency, data journalism, and capacity building in developing countries and emerging economies.

I am teaching and supervising students in computer science, graphic design, journalism, media studies, creative technology, cartography and other disciplines, supporting them in a broad range of interesting adventures in data visualization.

I love exploring how the visual exploration and understanding of information can be improved, and trying to understand the 'design space' and the 'building blocks' of data visualizations and the ways in which these can be combined to construct useful, attractive visualizations."

Since the strength of linguistic typology depends to a large extent on the quality of the grammars which feed the databases, the group has a special interest in all aspects of fieldwork methods and descriptive linguistics from the use of software tools (PRAAT, Language Explorer 8) to standards for data collection and processing, linguistic argumentation and ethical fieldwork. 

And since Austronesian and Melanesian linguistics have a long and strong tradition of cross-disciplinary research focusing on themes shared with anthropologists, archeologists, geneticists, historians and biologists, we also have a special interest in linguistic relationships (areal, genealogical, typological, statistic) as instruments within cross-disciplinary contexts for the study of human prehistory and population movements. Our focus here is on the prehistory and migration paths of the ancestors of Austronesian, Melanesian and Papuan speech communities.
