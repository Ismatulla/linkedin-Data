Here we focus on up-and-coming businesses that are as ambitious as we are, and determined to scale their brand as quickly as possible.

With Maison Leads we offer one service to one niche: Paid Advertisement for Real Estate and Property Businesses. That's it. Being this specific helped us to develop our skills and become very specialized in this field. We learned that speaking to all is speaking to none, and that is exactly what we implement for our clients. The main takeaway is: we’re advertisers, focusing on one thing and doing it well.

In August I obtained my Master degree in Political Science at the Radboud University Nijmegen. While studying, I also started my first real (temporary) job at the State Supervision of Mines (SodM). This regulating organisation is part of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate. Combining both studying and working was challenging, but I successfully acquired my Master. I specialised in International Relations and in my thesis I examined the theories neorealism and neoliberal institutionalism to explain the increased focus of the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative on Africa. In this thesis many of my interests converged. 

In 2018, during my bachelor Business Administration, I did my exchange at the Beijing University of Technology. I enjoyed my time there and kept my interest. I tried to continue my efforts in mandarin and so far I secured my A2/HSK 2 language certificate at the Radboud University. To stay informed about China I read a lot and I voluntary teach Dutch to some Chinese speakers. This already for four years.

My interest in Africa grew during my graduation internship in South-Africa. I did my internship at Origin Wine and wrote an export strategy for the Chinese wine market. After coming back, my interest never faded. Therefore I am very proud to contribute to De Africast (podcast) with its goal to dispel all the misconceptions that many have on the African Continent. The podcast, wherefore I am the editor in chief, is an initiative by NIGIZ, where I am in the board. 

After my internship in South-Africa I joined Krijger & Partners Krijger as Government Relations Advisor with focus on the geopolitical developments around China. I was supporting and organising several China events and provided support to businesses and organisations. I was also working part-time at China Circle and joined the board of the Young China Circle after the Ministry of Foreign Affairs presented the Dutch China “Strategy”.

Because I my warm feelings for entrepreneurship, together with a friend with which I studied in China, we founded East Commerce Group. We did this in partnership with a merchant in Hong Kong shipping company and imported different kind of products. This was a very educational period, but I decided that I wanted to continue studying. After studying in China and South-Africa, my work at Krijger & Partners and my ephemeral time in business, I decided to change course and enrolled for the pre-master in political science at the Radboud University. The rest is history."

Voordat ik ben begonnen met studeren aan een hogeschool heb ik een tweetalig HAVO diploma behaald waardoor ik vloeiend Nederlands en Engels spreek.

Naast studeren heb ik mezelf ontwikkeld via een aantal zeer uiteenlopende bijbaantjes. Dit varieert van de horeca tot bezorgservice. In mijn studententijd heb ik me aangesloten bij een studentenvereniging in 's-Hertogenbosch waarvan ik van 2018 tot 2019 voorzitter ben geweest."

I study International Business Administration (IBA) at Tilburg University, the Netherlands, with an interest in Finance, Data Science, Supply chains and Entrepreneurship. For this I followed extra-curricular courses in Python, databases and a minor in Supply chain management. Currently, I am studying abroad in the USA, where I follow courses in M&A, Fintech, Data Analytics in Marketing, Entrepreneurship and new venture planning. Furthermore, the world of finance has always been of interest to me, and one of my hobbies includes analysing and investing in stocks, especially the American Markets. Geopolitics, broad market trends, technology and AI are also fields of interest to me, which I frequently read and learn about in my free time. Other than that, friends and a social and active lifestyle are important to me. I like to go do things.

In the next year (semester starting January 2023), I am planning to start a pre-master in Data science and Entrepreneurship and Business at the JADS (a collaboration between business university: Tilburg University and Technological University Eindhoven)."
