This made it possible for other reputable researchers to be attracted, then the fundamental research on malaria parasites gained more depth and strengthened partnerships with national and international malaria researchers.
Moreover, I contributed to refine the Leiden Rodent Malaria research model, supported the development of transfection of malaria parasites and set up imaging techniques for malaria research. Besides running the Molecular Biology lab my expertise is mainly used for genetic modification , analysis of malaria parasites, supporting researchers and giving guidance to students. The resulting mutant and transgenic malaria parasites are subjected to studies in mosquitoes with additionally genetic and immunological studies to ultimately obtain parasites for applicable ""live malaria"" vaccines.
