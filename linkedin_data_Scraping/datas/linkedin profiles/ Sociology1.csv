To this I have dedicated my career.

In 2006, when I was appointed as program director for the BA and MA in Sociology at the Tilburg University faculty of social sciences, I was invited to design, in collaboration with colleagues from other faculties, an educational Liberal Arts and Sciences program. After the accreditation of the program in 2007, I was appointed Vice-Dean of the LAS program. In January of 2012 I became Dean of LAS and in 2013 was appointed as Educational Professor at Tilburg University, the designation indicating that it is a professorship not involving research. 

I am currently Dean of the Liberal Arts and Sciences (LAS) Bachelor‚Äôs program at Tilburg University. As such I bear final responsibility for the educational policy of Liberal Arts and Sciences in Tilburg and its implementation in the program. Under my leadership the LAS program in Tilburg has flourished: the program scores high in national rankings (having been officially recognized as a top-rated program since 2014), our student inflow has been rising steadily, and our graduates are not only admitted to prestigious (research) Master‚Äôs programs both in the Netherlands and abroad, they are also very successful in them. I am proud to say that our students are very enthusiastic, that the courses in the program get excellent evaluations, and not least of all that the quality of the teachers is rated as outstanding.

In my team we try to use advanced data techniques to develop the newest legal tech for our customers (legal professionals). Next to a searchable library that needs to be optimised, we also try to use data science to create new connections between documents. This helps our customers get the information they need faster. 

I have always liked to use data science in fields that I did not know much about beforehand. Before working at Legal Intelligence I have worked at ABN Amro as a data analyst for (sustainable) investment products. Next to that I gained experience at the province of North-Holland by modelling traffic light controllers and their delay. I have also worked at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam as a data scientist to analyse student performance in different environments. 

In my Master Data Science I have learned a lot about programming, machine learning and the optimal usage of data-analysis. I loved studying something technical after a long 'career' in social sciences. 

I finished two bachelors: Sociology and Political Science. During my Bachelor in Sociology, I have gained extensive experience with SPSS, including necessary skills such as multiple regression and factor analysis. In my thesis, I created a scaling of dutch occupations based on their social-economic status. I used a multitrait-multimethod analysis to validate the constructed scale.¬†

Because of my bachelor in political science, I can easily spot societal and political challenges and see what ethical and legal aspects these challenges bring. It also taught me how social and ethical dimensions construct narratives, arguments and opinions. In that finding lies a possibly more important lesson of seeing how the opinions of other people are founded. It enables me to look beyond my own opinion."

I hold a researcher position at two universities - Leiden University in Leiden, the Netherlands, and Charles University in Prague, the Czech Republic. I have recently completed PhD in Political Sciences at Leiden University. I am focusing predominately on the new parties of political entrepreneurs and their party organization.
My previous research dealt with new anti-establishment parties, post-communist party systems and rise of populist politics in central-eastern Europe. I have focused on the role of party organization in the electoral success of new anti-establishment parties. To achieve this research objective, firstly, a single case study took place, analysing three party organizational aspects (local party organization, party membership and the party elite). Secondly, a comparative analysis with three other parties in three different European countries was conducted. This research project was conducted under the supervision of Professor Dr Petr Kopecky and Dr Maria Spirova.
I have acquired my master's degree in Globalization (politics and sociology) from the University of Aberdeen, the United Kingdom, where I have graduated with commendation in November 2013. My master's research was a comparative study of differences in integration between Czech and Polish migrants in the United Kingdom, supervised by Dr Christopher Kollmeyer.
