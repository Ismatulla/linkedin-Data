Research
As a researcher at Maastricht University, I have found joy in balancing the challenging cord of multidisciplinary research. Functioning as behavioral economist in the Real Estate group, I currently investigate the behavioral impact of crisis on policy and performance.. I am able to do so thanks to my degrees in Psychology and Behavioral Economics as well as additional training in (Sustainable) Finance, Marketing, and Econometrics. 

Teaching
Being an adamant believer of letting nothing go to waste, I put my degree in Education to work, making sure students in my courses are motivated, knowledgeable, and eager. A low threshold for approachability and a high bar concerning expected performance characterizes my teaching style. The willing will be able. 
 
Community
Finally, I am a strong believer (and the living evidence) that research is not solely for genius people.  As such, I am the proud organizer of the SBE Science Slam, in which young aspiring researchers present their research in a fun and relaxed off-campus setting to an unknowledgeable audience.

During my MSc Political Science and Political Economy at the LSE, I have acquired invaluable knowledge in the field of political economy, both substantively and methodologically. In addition to developing crucial skills in quantitative causal inference and analysis, my courses encouraged me to engage critically with data-based work and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of vari- ous empirical methods. Through the completion of coursework and the upcoming writing of my Master’s dissertation, I learnt to conduct research independently, acquiring practical experience in applying the scientific methods I learnt to topics that are of interest to me. Those methods include the mastery of Excel, Stata, LaTeX, and I have a strong desire to familiarise myself with other programmes, such as R. Overall, my studies provided me a new overarching perspective on the way politics shape societies, and vice versa. I am particularly interested in how electoral outcomes shape fiscal, macroeconomic, and environmental policy.

My quantitative skills were first developed in a business setting, during my BSc International Business at the University of Maastricht, in the Netherlands. My classes in finance, economics, quantitative methods and econometrics allowed me to acquire serious knowledge in mathematics and their application to real-world contexts, as well as crucial expertise in international trade and the business world. During my studies, I have also demonstrated strong organisational skills: I have completed almost an extra years’ worth of credits through participation in my faculty’s Honours Programme and my undertaking of a minor in human and legal decision-making (jointly with the faculties of law, psychology and economics). 

In addition to my skills in research and data analysis, I am a strong communicator and listener, very eager to learn and embrace new challenges. I speak English, French and German fluently and I thrive in multi-cultural settings and intellectually stimulating. "

My supervisors are Prof. Dr. E.C. Perotti and Prof. Dr. F. Van der Ploeg. My research is in climate finance and focuses on understanding the effects of financial frictions on effective strategies for addressing climate change.  I have two main areas of study:

In my work on climate change adaptation, I examine the relationship between financial constraints and optimal adaptation to physical climate risk at the household level.  I study the dynamic consequences on housing, income, and wealth inequality, and evaluate the design and political feasibility of policies aimed at alleviating the effects associated with financial constraints.
As financial factors shape the transition to a sustainable and low-carbon economy, I also study the interaction between financial frictions and climate transition risk at the corporate level. I examine how these frictions affect the pace of the green transition and explore the impact on the pricing and ownership dynamics of corporate bonds.

I hold an MPhil in Economics from Tinbergen Institute (with distinction), a Bachelor of Science in Economics (with highest distinction) and a Bachelor in Law from Erasmus University Rotterdam.

My main interests are neuroeconomics, investor behaviour, colour nudging, financial decision making (neurofinance), and neuromarketing. The processes in the brain during decision making fascinate me. 

In the future I would very much like to focus on choice behaviour related to marketing, in other words; neuromarketing. How can you for instance choose the right marketing techniques to influence your target group, and therewith generate the desired (buying) behaviour? Also, what happens in the consumer's brain when they see a certain advertisement, and how can this be used to improve your marketing? 

The new insights provided by the rapidly upcoming field that is neuromarketing are refreshing and could significantly boost a marketing strategy. As an open-minded person, I hope that during my MSc in Human Decision Science at Maastricht University, I will be able to extend my knowledge regarding the psychological side of everyday business!"
