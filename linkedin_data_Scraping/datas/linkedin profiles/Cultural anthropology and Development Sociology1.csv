Trained as an anthropologist, I'm specialized in ethnographic research on violence, (dis)order, (prison) governance and state-(un)making, particularly in Nicaragua. Currently I also work on these topics in the city of Amsterdam, as PI on the research project ""Het Ongelijkheidsbeginsel"" (the principle of inequality), which takes a holistic approach to understand the ways in which urban inequalities (spatial, socio-economic and racial/ethnic) are mitigated and/or reproduced through criminal justice interventions.

At the same time, I continue to research practices of (para-)policing, imprisonment, state crime and organized crime in Nicaragua. In relation to the 2018 protests and their aftermath, I work with (former) political prisoners and their family members, Nicaraguan exiles and refugees, and human rights activists in doing so. I am currently working on two book projects. The first is a volume I'm editing with Hanneke Stuit and Jennifer Turner, titled ""Carceral Worlds"", which explores the expansion of carcerality in our globalized present and how this may be unsettled. The second is a book manuscript based on my doctoral thesis, which was awarded a cum laude distinction. This thesis ""Performing Prison: Power, Agency and Co-Governance in Nicaraguan Prisons"" was based on 31 months of multi-sited ethnographic research conducted between 2009 and 2016 with long and short-sentenced (former) prisoners of three Nicaraguan prison facilities.

In general, I am much interested in the day-to-day workings of prison life and the (development) of carceral/penal states, policing and other forms of non-state/extralegal surveillance and governance, always with a focus on questions of power and legitimacy, violence, gender and the body. To this end, I participate actively in a number of interdisciplinary networks on confinement and prisons research, including the Global Prisons Research Network (as a co-organizer), the EASA Anthropology of Confinement Network (former co-convener), and the Americas Prisons Research Network/Red Penitenciaria de las Americas (founding member).

“Grote dingen gebeuren niet alleen door een impuls, maar als een opeenvolging van kleine dingen die met elkaar verbonden zijn.” (van Gogh)

Ik geloof in de alledaagse kleine acties die voor de grootste impact kunnen zorgen. Dit kan een gesprek zijn met een vreemde in het park. Dit kan een autorit van een uur zijn met een persoon die je pas net hebt ontmoet. Het is een rimpel effect dat klein begint maar daarna zich alleen zal verspreiden als je het laat zijn. 

Als project manager verzorg ik de dagelijkse operaties zodat een mooi resultaat geleverd wordt. Ik ga door bij tegenslagen en vraag altijd “Hoe kan dit anders?”. Ik combineer een goede dosis van analytisch denken en het onderscheid maken tussen het essentiële en niet-essentiële. Verder neem ik altijd mijn enthousiasme en humor mee naar werk. 

Project management | Communicatief | Verbindend  | Creatief | Leergierig

""Great thing are done by a series of small things brought together"" (van Gogh) 

I believe that it is small mundane actions that can generate the biggest impact. This can be a conversation with a stranger in the park. This can be a one hour car drive with a person you just met. It is a ripple effect that starts very small but can only expand if you let it be. 

As a project manager I take care of the daily operations to create a great result. When facing challenges I ask myself the question “How can I do this differently?” I combine a good dose of analytical thinking and discerning between the essential and non-essential. Further, I always make sure I bring in enthusiasm and humor to work.
