I have obtained my bachelor's degree in chemistry at Inholland University of Applied Sciences. 

Besides chemistry, I am interested in modern languages and cultures (especially Japanese), human psychology, sports (I play volleyball and badminton), music, cooking and books. In August 2016, I went to Fukuoka, Japan on my own to study Japanese for 4 weeks. 

I enjoy helping other people, i.e. tutoring. I have spent 3 years in the programme committee representing the voices of fellow students during my bachelor's and I am currently a member of the programme committee as a master student member at the UvA/VU Amsterdam. I am someone who has learned to work hard and embraces challenges. I like trying new things as I am an open-minded person."

Currently, I am the last year of my Ph.D. in University of Amsterdam about physical chemistry, here I am using fluorescence microscopy/ spectroscopy to study the organocatalysis reaction at the single molecule level, in which some fluorescence probes/ dyes are involved. The broad research fields in physical chemistry made me have an open mind for further scientific study and career development. I really like working with a group and interested in communicating with people. In my bachelor, I worked in the student union for 4 years. During my master, I supervised more than 4 individual bachelor student projects. In my Ph.D., except for the group teaching tasks, I also supervised 10+ individual bachelor/ master student projects. I am excited at the prospect of working in R&D center of the chemical company. "

During this study several techniques (e.g. LC, GC, UV-VIS and AAS) were discussed and practiced. Further, my Bachelor’s covered also parts of Physics, Biology and Criminology. I did three projects: one major project (Comparing fluorescent dyes for quantitative DNA analysis) and two internships. During my first internship I carried out a literature study into postmortem biochemical markers and a project into body cooling & temperature measurements (published in Int J Legal Med 130(2)). My second internship was a research into decomposition of human tissue in strong inorganic acidic and basic solutions (BASc. thesis).

After finishing my Bachelor’s, I started a Master’s in Chemistry with a specialization in Analytical Science. During this Master’s I obtained knowledge on physical-chemical properties of molecules, separation, detection and data analysis (MATLAB). My Master's thesis focused on detection of veterinary drugs in canine ear tissue using liquid-liquid extraction and GC-MS (Shimadzu GCMS QP2010 Ultra).

I did my PhD in the School of Pharmacy of the University of Nottingham focussing on the use of liquid extraction surface analysis-tandem mass spectrometry (LESA-MS/MS) for high throughput quantitative analysis of proteins adsorbed onto polymer microarrays in relation to cell response. Here, I worked with different Orbitrap mass spectrometers (Exactive, Q Exactive plus, Q Exactive HF).

After, I joined the Life Science Trace Gas Facility, Radboud University Nijmegen as a postdoctoral researcher to work in the NUTRISHIELD project which involves the analysis of volatile organic molecules in relation to dietary quality of children.

Currently, I hold a researcher position in the Life Science Trace Detection Laboratory (www.ru.nl/tdlab) where I am responsible for the mass spectrometry division of our lab."
