I am particular interested in how European society in the 16th century changed as a result of the Reformation, a social movement that overthrew the Catholic Church. For example, I analyse how scholars specialised in their communication roles and why territories adopted Protestantism. A central aim of my research is to understand the driving factors of transitions, accounting for interdependencies and heterogeneities in complex social systems. This is achieved by merging analytical tools and concepts from various disciplines such as Social Network Analysis, Event History Models, Potential Outcome Model of causality, and conventional regressions."

I lead the Urban Analytics Lab at the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering. I direct the Social Urban Data Lab at the Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions as a Research Fellow. In addition, I am affiliated with the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for BOLD Cities.

My research spans the fields of city design, urban mobility, and spatial data science. I focus on measuring and evaluating urban design qualities that contribute to more walkable, sustainable, healthy, and welcoming cities for all. I am convinced that in order for cities to achieve their public health and sustainability goals, quantifiable targets and standards must be developed and consistently measured. As a result, I develop evidence-based measurable indicators, which are frequently co-created with stakeholders, to help cities transition to a healthier, fairer, and more sustainable future for all citizens. I incorporate these metrics into software tools to assist designers, planners, and policy-makers in assessing pedestrian accessibility, walkability, safety, playability, and other perceived qualities of the physical environment. To identify, represent, and prioritize the factors that ensure our urban spaces are accessible, welcoming, and healthy, I bring together approaches from urban science, public health, and systems thinking with cutting-edge mobility research and spatial data science methods. I am involved in several national, European, and international research projects about cities, mobility, environmental exposures, health, and well-being.

Before joining the IDE faculty, I was a postdoctoral researcher within the Web Information Systems (WIS) group, at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science (EEMCS), TU Delft, between 2016 and 2019.

Research

My research examines bias in digital media and methods using computational techniques and experiments. I analyze depictions of social groups and their impact on prejudice and discrimination. I also investigate how digital technologies influence biases in hiring and recruitment, focusing on implicit biases in algorithms and unconscious biases of recruiters. I am particularly interested in the consequences of algorithmic profiling for vulnerable job seekers, such as older individuals, in the digital job market. Additionally, I am exploring the content, causes, and effects of bias in computational tools, supported by an NWO Open Competition grant, specifically examining the degree to which annotation bias contributes to bias in machine learning models and its downstream implications for classification.

Impact: Digital Infrastructure and Data Science

As a lead member of various infrastructure and data science initiatives, my primary goal is to accelerate computational and data science research for SSH-researchers. I am responsible for coordinating the PDI-SSH funded project Twi-XL, which creates an infrastructure for cross-media research, and co-leading the ODISSEI-funded Media and Content Analysis Lab (MCAL), which integrates content analytical tools and communication science data into the broader SSH-infrastructure landscape. Additionally, I am the communication science representative of the Social and Behavioral Science Data Science Center of the University of Amsterdam. 

Teaching and supervision

I specialize in teaching and supervising computational social science techniques. I am passionate about sharing knowledge on big data and digital methods through seminars and courses for both undergraduate and graduate students. As a co-supervisor of several PhD candidates, I have experience guiding research projects where computational methods play a central role.

I completed my master in Cultural Sociology (Cum Laude, University of Amsterdam) with a thesis titled “The culinary order: sustainable consumer identities and new organizational forms on the alternative market for foods.”

The two studies are characterized by rather different substantive domains (dance vs sustainable food), yet they also share a connection due to their focus on how the interplay between change-seeking movements and established actors shapes processes of innovation.

I obtained a master degree in earth sciences at the ETH in Zurich with a specialization in geochemistry, mineralogy and mineral resources. My master thesis topic was the hydrothermal-magmatic origin of a porphyry Cu deposit in Argentina. The earth science department of this university was ranked best in the world in 2015 and 2016. During my curriculum, I attended a total of five universities in four different countries: The University of Amsterdam (UvA) and the University of Utrecht (UU) in the Netherlands, the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM) in Mexico, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zürich (ETH) in Switzerland and the McGill University in Canada. 

I am globally orientated and interested to be able to combine my love for both geologic science and my curiosity to get to know the many parts of the world.  I speak, read and write the Dutch, English and Spanish language and I am at a beginner level in French, German and Portuguese.
