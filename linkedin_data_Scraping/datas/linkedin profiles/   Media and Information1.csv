Driving content marketing campaigns focused on SEO optimisation, requires a high attention to details due to how time-sensitive these can be. Since joining the affiliate marketing sphere, I got extremely familiar with:

- Ad space buying on cost-per-acquisition (CPA) basis
- CRM and CSM tools
- Website audit tools and PPC campaigns 
- SEO optimisation, KPIs tracking and data analysis strategies (e.g: Screaming Frog, Ahrefs, Google Analytics, Google Search Console)
- Keyword research processes and audience forecasting
- Salesforce (identifying opportunities and support with campaign implementation)
- Social Media automation and monitoring tools (Zoho Socials, Hootsuite, Later)
- Content Creation and Design (Adobe Creative Cloud with emphasis on Premiere Pro and After Effects + Canva.com)
- Project management (Monday.com and Trello)
- Visualisation softwares such as Tableau
... plus many other tools used in various projects I have been a part of.

I'm a trilingual talent (EN/NL/ES) with a flair for big-picture thinking about language and media, a knack for translating data into creative content, and an obsession with improving processes. Whether as a freelancer or part of a team, I leverage these strengths to answer the big questions posed by communicating on and offline in the digital age.

I've spent the last six years managing multilingual websites, building links, optimizing SEO, crafting SaaS marketing content, editing literary translations, running a Mexican backpackers' hostel, living through the end of the 20th century's longest-running armed conflict, and writing tens of thousands of digital words about language, media, travel, and globalization. 

For just a few examples of how I've put this perspective to use as a writer and communicator:

• Optimizing www.animana.com to rank in top 3 search results for vital keywords in English and Dutch
• Writing top-performing posts for Transparent Language, frequently earning 5,000+ pageviews and generating brand engagement in the form of comments and social shares
• Acquiring links from government and university websites to increase domain authority for brands like Global English Editing via long-form 'ultimate guide' resource posts
• Generating stakeholder buy-in via targeted email campaigns to students, professors, and administrators at Florida State University to create new curricular undergraduate research program (UROP) that has since more than tripled in size"

Verslagen en andere registraties kunnen worden doorgestuurd naar het EPD (Elektronisch Patiënten Dossier), maar ook aan systemen voor screening, onderzoek en voor kwaliteitsregistraties.

Endoscopie, ECG’s, röntgenbeelden, digitale foto’s, oogheelkundige metingen, echo’s en OK-beelden zijn voorbeelden van informatie, die met behulp van ons product, Clinical Assistant, worden opgeslagen en toegankelijk worden gemaakt. Uniek aan Clinical Assistant is, dat het niet alleen algemeen beeldmanagement ondersteunt, maar ook een krachtige workflowondersteuning bezit. Het product biedt tevens een uitgebreide functionaliteit voor verslaglegging en registraties: onderzoeksverslagen en andere gegevens worden snel en gestructureerd vastgelegd. Ten slotte biedt Clinical Assistant de mogelijkheid om statistiek te bedrijven op de vastgelegde gegevens."
