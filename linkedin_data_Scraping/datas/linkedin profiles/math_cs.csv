I received my Diploma in Mathematics back in 2004, and then I enrolled at the Azad University of Mashhad for a B.Sc. in Computer Software Engineering. During the second half of my bachelor's degree, I was involved in teaching as a teaching assistant until I was graduated in 2009. My study followed by joining Multimedia University (MMU) for my master's degree entitled Master of Multimedia (E-learning Technologies), and I received my master's degree certificate in 2012. Thereafter, I worked as a full-time Lecturer at the Faculty of Multimedia Creativity (FMC), the Limkokwing University of Creative Technology in Malaysia. 

I am currently working as a full-time University Lecturer (and Researcher) in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science (M&CS) at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). I am mostly teaching courses in the area of programming languages, data science, and software engineering. Also, I am a researcher at the Software Engineering and Technology Research Cluster (SET). My current research at SET focuses on technology-enhanced education, blended learning, AI in education, and interactive educational systems. Before joining TU/e, I worked as a researcher at the University of Bremen and then German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI), Germany where I received my ""Dr.-Ing."" title in April 2020. During my Ph.D., I conducted research that was mostly dedicated to finding out the impacts of visual block-based programming environments on young learners' motivation to study computer science and the acquisition of programming skills in the context of smart objects and environments.

My area of research focuses on Computer Science Education (CSE), Programming Education, Technology-Enhanced Education, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Visual and Block-Based Programming, Physical Computing, Interactive Educational Systems, AI in Education, and Software Engineering. 

I am a member of ACM as well as a regular reviewer for ACM Special Interest Group on CS Education (SIGCSE). Also, I am a member of the Education Working Group at VERSEN (Dutch National Association for Software Engineering)."

Understanding the answer to this question allows us to be more effective in nearly any situation.  This awareness becomes particularly important in situations where technical information is at stake.

In the realm of formal logic, this question formed the guidance to my research, but its application is much wider.  Understanding the possibilities--and limitations -- of communication helps us understand and approach problems on a very practical level.

From my experience reconceptualizing the world through the eyes of another culture, to re-imagining a familiar concept through the perspective of a mathematics student, each interaction turns on the information exchanged.  However, but just as important, is our ability to capture that information.

This experience makes me comfortable equally in a technical, rule-based setting, as it does in a setting where that technicality must be presented in an accessible format to those less familiar.

I'm passionate about discovering and developing new ideas, and about finding the best way to share them with others.  

My background is in mathematics, logic, and philosophy of language.  I've had the opportunity to work on multiple research projects within these fields (please email for CV and more details).  However, my experience is not limited to the conceptual.  I've worked directly with students and academic administrative offices, addressing both content and student acclimation to university life.    My international experience has taught me to work with a wide variety of people. 

I'm seeking an opportunity to put this experience to work.  I enjoy learning and problem-solving, and I work hard.  Perhaps I might communicate with you?"
