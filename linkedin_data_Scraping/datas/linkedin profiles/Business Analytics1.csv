This pursuit challenges my creativity, problem solving, and analytical thinking.

Throughout my higher education I have enjoyed many opportunities to expand and test my programming capabilities in the form of practical assignments. One of my most memorable courses implemented a public leaderboard to rank each student team’s solution to a logistics scheduling problem. I was determined to find an effective solution and through persistence managed to implement the winning algorithm. 

Even in my spare time I tend to continue writing code. The focus of my home projects derives from my enjoyment of computer games, from which I garnered a curiosity to how these complex programs tick and how they could potentially be made better. Examples of such projects include the construction of an AI planner-, mesh triangulation-, and parallel pathfinding algorithms in the Unity game engine. Most recently I have been implementing an automated Machine Vision model for the detection and classification of characters in my favorite childhood game to advance my knowledge of Deep Learning in the field of Machine Vision. 

Next to my know-how in the art of programming, I have developed a pro-active attitude and fostered excellent collaborative and communicative skills. These skills were often vital in bringing group projects to completion and have greatly assisted me in navigating large scale projects such as my Bachelor’s end project and my Master’s internship.

My current roles:

● I am a lecturer in the course Inferential Statistics, which is offered to both premaster students (Feb + March) and bachelor students (April + May), respectively.

● As a data steward, I am responsible for the storage of research data (adherence to FAIR principles) and ensuring GDPR (EU privacy law) compliance in scientific research conducted at the institute.

● My research is focused on two key projects:

- Learning Analytics – I develop learning analytics to gain insights into study progress. As an example, I try to understand the learning trajectory in nongraded, formative quizzes through process variables such as duration, login time, and quiz grades.

- Psychometrics – I use simulated data to better understand how statistical models answer research questions relevant to psychological science. As an example, I simulate experience sampling method data that fits analyses with Multilevel Regression Model and with Multilevel Latent Markov Models to uncover when both analyses can best be applied.


Ambition:

I am currently seeking a PhD position starting this summer, and would be delighted to hear from anyone who feels my expertise and research interests would be a good fit for their team. Please feel free to reach out to me at your convenience.

Analytical techniques I have used and/or studied:

- Dynamic Network Models
- Discrete Latent Variable Models (e.g., Latent Class Analysis, Latent Markov Models)
- Multilevel Regression (e.g., Cross-Sectional and Repeated Measures)
- Continuous Latent Variable Models (e.g., Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis)
- Multiple Machine Learning Techniques (e.g., k-fold Cross Validation)
- Structural Equation Models
- Meta Analysis"
