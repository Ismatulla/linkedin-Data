For 30 years I wrote everything, and anything, whatever washed up on my aimless path - not even a path. More of a ruddlerless jazz-type voyage from one pit-bull of an idea to the next. These are some of the things that I wrote…

* features, interviews, news stuff, funny stuff, for a whole motley variety of magazines and websites
* Radio 4 comedy scripts
* book reviews, film reviews, toaster reviews, sex toy reviews
* dictionary definitions
* a poem about an alcoholic superfish
* a couple of suitably ironic songs about Jesus
* an online business English course for Italians
* a whole e-learning platform ... thing. I don’t know. It was a long time ago.
* a guide book for a virtual world
* a long-standing faux online identity (faux is a very nice word. Sounds sweet. Sexy almost. Much better than fake.) 
* translations for an Italian toiletries manufacturer

I also edited books and newsletters and I worked as a sub-editor for a while. Oh, and taught English for twenty years. And wrote four novels. All the while drifting like a feather. In a beautiful world. 

But as of March 2016, all that has changed. For in March 2016, I found focus. 

Now I'm catching up with the world and going online. Full immersion. Making a living from the skills I've accidentally built up over the past 30 years. Digital nomad. All that. How nomadic I'll be remains to be seen. How much of a living I'll make remains to be seen. But I've started. And I'm focused. 

What I'm doing on LinkedIn I have no idea. It just ground me down in the end. Like a bird pecking at your scalp for ten whole years. OK, OK. I'm in. Now what do you need?"
