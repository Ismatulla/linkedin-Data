My point of departure in my work is that a proper understanding of law requires a proper understanding of society. I derive this understanding from both legal theory (in the broad sense) and social theory (rather than sociology). I am inspired by modern and contemporary thinkers in these fields, such as H.L.A. Hart, Lon Fuller, John Rawls, Thomas Pogge and social theorists such as Ulrich Beck and Zygmunt Bauman. 

My understanding of society is  based upon the theory of reflexive modernization. Structural societal changes  continuously challenge us to question law (and legal theory) and whether or not to reconsider its self-evident assumptions and foundations in order to synchronise law and justice in our interdependent global world. In doing so, I contribute to the theoretical foundation of research of Ucall (Utrecht Centre for Liability and Accountability Law). 

My starting point as researcher blends in with my ideas about academic legal education, contributing to a more contextual (cross-disciplinary) approach towards studying law, tying law and its dilemma’s with society and societal developments. In doing so, I experiment with novel ways of teaching and learning, including blended learning, and am developing a pedagogy of legal education to strengthen the academic nature of legal education. (The work of for example Gert Biesta inspires me in this field). As Senior fellow, seconded to the Centre for Aacemic Teaching, Utrecht University, I have been given the possibility to explore further avenues into highre education, for example in the field of choice and self-regulation.

The wording is an accurate insight into my personal and professional passions. 

Following my undergraduate degree in Business Administration and Law from India, I pursued a Master's in International Dispute Settlement and Arbitration at Universiteit Leiden, the Netherlands.  

In hindsight, what drew my attention to the field of alternate dispute resolution was neither the research nor the process but the people involved. The Arbitrator, who showcased expertise in the subject matter of the dispute, which convinced parties of his fair decision; the Mediator, who focused on rebuilding relationships while being neutral; the Lawyers, who gave equal importance to commercial needs as legalities and who were willing to let go of the latter when circumstances demanded; and the Clients who were concerned with settlement rather than justice, were the ones to spark an interest in me, unlike any other judicial mechanism. 

Presently, I am engaged in a Fellowship Programme at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague. I hope to carve a niche for myself in the globalised field of dispute resolution through my learnings and experiences.

In my first master's at Tilburg University in International Law and Global Governance, I confronted myself with the main areas of global governance. In particular 1)international law and international relations 2)human rights and human security 3) global sustainability and environmental law. 

This multidisciplinary approach allowed me to reflect more critically on the functioning of the global system and the impact of international law in different sectors of society. Most importantly it highlighted the role of private economic actors, culture, political institutions, and civil society.

I concluded my master's with a thesis in the field of transitional justice with the title ' Emotional reconciliation and bottom-up participation for communities in transition. The objective of the thesis is to highlight the importance of having a community participating in the hearings and in truth-seeking in a transitional project. This active participation can foster emotions such as empathy and forgiveness, arguably, ways to achieve reconciliation.

In my second master's at RUG university in Public International Law  I aim to obtain relevant legal training and practical skills in the field of international law. This could be facilitated by the presence of a positivist legal approach and seminars that enhance the opportunity to become a qualified professional. High-quality legal writing and the development of ingenious legal reasoning are key aspects of the program.

With this background and qualifications in different languages, I aim to give my contribute to the international legal environment."

These grants fund my project Administrative Vulnerability which will last from 2023-2028 and  two research teams at Tilburg Law School and at Lund University. 

 My research agenda is focused on two interconnected topics: (i) regulatory policy and the advancement of innovation; (ii) the impact of digital transformations on inequality.

My work on regulation and innovation delves into regulatory performance, experimental regulations, regulatory sandboxes, sunset clauses, and future-proofing approaches to lawmaking. My current scholarship on public law and digital transformations investigates the rights of vulnerable citizens in the digital society, the impact of digital social welfare on fundamental rights, the protection of public values in the platform economy, and the design of smart cities.
