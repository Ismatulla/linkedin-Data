If my fellow students would describe me with one word, it would be curiosity. I always search for something within my academic courses and projects which sparks my curiosity to give me and my teammates drive and fulfilment. I‚Äôm interested in various topics such as cultural differences, mathematical decision-making processes and global business shifts. 
Through my fair share of education at different universities, adaption to different administrations and university cultures proved to be an essential skill to learn. By following the suggested study guidelines I wouldn't have learned the knowledge and skills I now know (luckily they are suggestions!). Throughout my studies, I maintained a red thread of striving to improve my current study programme and be in discussions with professors or academic directors. During summer vacations I stayed busy with summer jobs, voluntary work or language courses. Especially the healthcare sector attracted me by its dynamic workflow and social aspects.
Currently, I am busy expanding my knowledge in the econometric field at the VU in Amsterdam, as well as working as an external auditor for ESN Tilburg, a global student association.
In the near future, my distance towards Asia will decrease by attending SungKyunKwan University, South Korea, for an exchange semester from September 2023 onwards. My master choice lies with numbers and policy making, mainly in the business taxation or auditing field."
