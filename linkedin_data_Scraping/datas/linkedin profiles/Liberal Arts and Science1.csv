This entails honest self-exploration and self-confrontation, as well as positive transformation of key aspects of their 'inner world' (the psyche and personality) that have been 'frozen', immobile, lacking vitality and thus holding them back. Typically, these are manifest as self-limiting cognitions and self-sabotaging behaviours, and/or conflicts between personality parts, and/or unhealed emotional wounds (trauma).
   My working principles are equality, mutual respect, non-violent communication, empathy and compassion.
   In working with clients, I am inevitably confronted by my limitations, blind spots and, sometimes, false assumptions. However, I have come to realise that 'failure' is illusory: limitations, blind spots and false assumptions, once consciously realised, are just opportunities to learn and grow.
   Guiding personal change requires a client-centred approach and a therapeutic attitude of patient inquisitiveness, respect and empathy. Each individual is unique and special, so standard treatment protocols are inappropriate. For each new client, a new therapy unfolds naturally when the therapist trusts the process -- to which empathy is crucial -- and encourages the client to take ownership of, and full responsibility for, his/her problems, to set his/her own goals and to take concrete steps towards them.
  The practice is a non-judgmental listening space, because curiosity and discovery end as soon as judging starts. Judgment drives disconnection; empathy creates connnection. Each client is unique and special and deserves warm understanding, unconditional empathy and excellent care.
  
The keys to success of therapy are:
1. Seeing that each 'problem' is actually an opportunity;
2. Realising that 'negative' emotions are messengers that have come to tell us about our unmet needs;
3. Cultivating ""witnessing presence"" (as defined by Eckhart Tolle in 'The Power of Now');
4. Being ""a heart with ears"" (as envisioned by the late Dr Marshall B. Rosenberg);
5. Encouraging open, creative thinking and imagining, unconditional self-empathy, and excellent self-care;
6. Mobilising the innate wisdom and self-healing power of the human psyche.

None of this would have been possible without Hans Knibbe, Pieter van Dijk, Edwin Königel, Karen te Pas, Wim Bresser, Erik Ivo Homan, Hans van der Esch, Michelle Dusseldorp, Rita Gras & Cathelijne Veenkamp. There are no words to express my gratitude to you, my patient, empathetic, wise guides and role-models."
