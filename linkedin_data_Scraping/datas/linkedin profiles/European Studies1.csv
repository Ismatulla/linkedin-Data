Besides that, even when I am locked in my room, my mind has already reached many other places that I would never imagine. 

This has been strengthened by my previous experiences abroad. Originally from Italy, I spent part of my third academic year studying at KU Leuven in Leuven, Belgium. Leuven was a revelatory experience that showed me that I love international settings, which is to say engaging with people who have different backgrounds and adventures. 

 Upon my graduation at the University of Perugia, Italy, I spent almost two months living in Istanbul, Turkey. There, I was doing a traineeship that allowed me to work with an international group of people. It boosted my empathy, cross-cultural sensitivity and teamworking skills. Not satisfied, I moved to Brussels for another traineeship, at the Umbria Region - Brussels Office, which allowed me to enter into the 'Brussels bubble' and acquired insights of networking, policy-making process, lobby activities. For that reason, I ended up in Maastricht to study European Studies, specialisation in Global Challenges.

As a former MEP, I know that many organizations are not aware of the opportunities that the European Union offers.

I like to guide companies, public entities and non-profit organizations further in the European decision-making processes, advising them on opportunities to position themselves strategically on policies, regulations, financial support programs and knowledge networks.

In recent years I have gained extensive European experience working for various administrations (EU, national government, province and municipalities) and working at the intersection of government and business.

My passion? Making Europe work for you!
