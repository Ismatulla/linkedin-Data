I research and write about science, sustainability, technology, and culture for mission-driven organisations like Metabolic and Elsevier.

Some of my favourite topics include regenerative agriculture, sustainable industry, digital product passports, issues such as scarce metals and SU plastic, and the intersection of grassroots conservation with top-down policy. 

My innate environmental and social conscience drives an analytical mindset and a penchant for translating topical issues into palatable and useful articles, websites, white papers, and reports. My specialty lies in grasping complex topics — such as systems, academic and scientific research, current affairs, and social trends — and weaving together an engaging story that everyone can understand. I use comprehensive research, interviewing skills, and lively storytelling methods to make engaging content. 

My copywriting skills include writing news articles, reports, online content, press releases, social media and creative texts, commercial materials, and ghostwriting books for organisations and private entities. 

Having been on-camera as a reporter and announcer for CBS in the United States, I enjoy engaging an audience and know how to create content that appeals to diverse groups. New experiences, cultures, and technological advances inspire me tremendously."

That is our question.
⚡️Blue-Green Futures’ mission: weaving systems change through regenerative solutions and communities that untrash and restore our air, land and water — while pollinating economic and social well-being for all.
🌳 Forging equitable, democratic societies focused on long-term growth inspires me to address the complex issues and solutions on 🌍. I get energized through innovative teamwork that allows me to follow my passions for learning and growing while co-creating, scaling-up and evolving resilient, regenerative solutions to achieve the SDGs. I find joy and purpose in improving governance, ethics, economics, nature, technology, media, education and human rights. 
🌞 I love circularity, ecorestoration, climate restoration (GGR) and other regenerative progress in areas like the built environment, regen agriculture/aquaculture, MRV, health care, transportation and energy. Designing regenerative cultures while co-creating systems change is how we will repair our shared home and evolve together. Let’s explore how to accelerate growth for: bioregionalism, resilient communities, NbS, digital infrastructure, responsible law enforcement, leadership, policy, finance, eco-tech and human well-being.
🌚 Previously, I worked at the UN (UNICRI) Centre for AI & Robotics to advance action-oriented engagement on research, projects and governance frameworks that concentrated on the ethical, legal, social and security implications of how advanced technologies like AI are utilised by criminals, terrorists and stakeholders in security.  
🦉 Education, empathy, curiosity, culture and intrinsic motivation are what I value most. All excellent leaders and strategies that produce high-quality results require concentrating on education, human potential, ecological/human health, relationships and trust. At Leiden University, I got my master’s in International Relations and enjoyed advancing the community of classmates by leading the International Studies Student Association. 
🌍 Earlier, I followed my everlasting passion for improving education by working at Tufts University for senior leadership to manage their communications, PR and university-wide strategic planning initiatives. I also have professional media and marketing experiences, like helping the VICE Media marketing team establish their new TV Channel, VICELAND.

Join: EcoRestoration Alliance 🌍 

My passions:
- Cultures
- Empowering cultural forces for planet repair, such as art & sports
- Mother nature
- Education

In 2016 he conducted preliminary fieldwork research on same-sex lives and cultures on the island of Curaçao funded by the Sylva W. de Groot Fund and Stichting Fundatie van de Vrijvrouwe van Renswoude. 

He did his PhD at the University of Amsterdam on a Dutch national research council funded (NWO) research project. His PhD centres on the concept of sexual citizenship beyond their legal conceptualisation in Curaçao and Bonaire by analysing cultural articulations and practices such as archival collections, literature, theatre, and cultural performance. He investigates how these cultural practices and articulations grapple with recent developments about sexual and gender minority rights, tourism, the colonial relationships with the Netherlands, and their historical legacy. 

Publications include ‘Looking for kambrada: sexuality and social anxieties in the Dutch colonial archive, 1882-1923,’ Tijdschrift voor genderstudies 22 (2): 125–143. This article received an honourable mention for the Gregory Sprague Prize for an outstanding article on LGBT+ and queer history selected by the Committee on LGBT history (2020). Tectum Verlag published his first book, The Question of Dutch Politics as a Matter of Theatre: Theatre and Performance, after the 2008 Financial Crisis in 2017. His other publications focus on LGBT movements in the Netherlands and the former Netherlands Antilles, queer archives, cultural practices and post-colonial intellectuals in the Netherlands.

I believe that social media can be a positive space filled with enlightening content if more people are aware of the different encouraging ways of utilising it.

I have a special interest in social media, where I aim to pursue a career in the advertising, content management and public relations (PR) sectors. To build and prepare myself for the future, I am constructing a foundation in journalism, where I write, edit and publish academic articles for an online magazine while also working and connecting within Tilburg University. Being a student mentor and part of my faculty's Programme Committee allowed me to communicate with peers while familiarising myself with the employment sector.

Over time I have learned to be independent and found interest in providing services for clients within customer relations. As an employee, I am an active member and is continuously willing to learn new information regarding the company, the assignments or my role. I would like to work in an environment that can guide me rightfully to grow as a team member and participate in the company's development.

 Indonesia has undergone major transformation in the post-Soeharto period since 1998. A wide array of public sector reform measures have been developed and implemented to make local and/or central government levels more transparent, accountable, and effective. One of the goals has been and still is to ensure that corruption in Indonesia is eradicated as much as possible. Corruption is a serious problem that hinders economic growth and sustainability, and leads to decreasing trust in government and the rule of law. This study examines the relationship between the effect of public sector reform on the prevention and/or eradication of corruption in the Indonesian public sector. For this, public sector reform types and trajectories and theories on corruption will serve as a theoretical framework to find mechanisms potentially underlying such dynamics. In addition, this study takes into account how public sector reform can be aligned with (local) social political and administrative culture and public morality (including perceptions of public integrity) in order to prevent corruption in Indonesian public institutions. The research question of this project will be answered by focusing on an in-depth case study of public sector reform and corruption in West Kalimantan province. In many ways, this province is an interesting and telling case for Indonesia as a whole as well as similar regions across the globe. The paper for this conference will present this research plan, its question and possible theoretical and methodological approaches in more detail."

⚡️Blue-Green Futures’ mission: weaving systems change through regenerative solutions and communities that untrash and restore our air, land and water — while pollinating economic and social well-being for all.
🌳 Forging equitable, democratic societies focused on long-term growth inspires me to address the complex issues and solutions on 🌍. I get energized through innovative teamwork that allows me to follow my passions for learning and growing while co-creating, scaling-up and evolving resilient, regenerative solutions to achieve the SDGs. I find joy and purpose in improving governance, ethics, economics, nature, technology, media, education and human rights. 
🌞 I love circularity, ecorestoration, climate restoration (GGR) and other regenerative progress in areas like the built environment, regen agriculture/aquaculture, MRV, health care, transportation and energy. Designing regenerative cultures while co-creating systems change is how we will repair our shared home and evolve together. Let’s explore how to accelerate growth for: bioregionalism, resilient communities, NbS, digital infrastructure, responsible law enforcement, leadership, policy, finance, eco-tech and human well-being.
🌚 Previously, I worked at the UN (UNICRI) Centre for AI & Robotics to advance action-oriented engagement on research, projects and governance frameworks that concentrated on the ethical, legal, social and security implications of how advanced technologies like AI are utilised by criminals, terrorists and stakeholders in security.  
🦉 Education, empathy, curiosity, culture and intrinsic motivation are what I value most. All excellent leaders and strategies that produce high-quality results require concentrating on education, human potential, ecological/human health, relationships and trust. At Leiden University, I got my master’s in International Relations and enjoyed advancing the community of classmates by leading the International Studies Student Association. 
🌍 Earlier, I followed my everlasting passion for improving education by working at Tufts University for senior leadership to manage their communications, PR and university-wide strategic planning initiatives. I also have professional media and marketing experiences, like helping the VICE Media marketing team establish their new TV Channel, VICELAND.

In 2016 he conducted preliminary fieldwork research on same-sex lives and cultures on the island of Curaçao funded by the Sylva W. de Groot Fund and Stichting Fundatie van de Vrijvrouwe van Renswoude. 

He did his PhD at the University of Amsterdam on a Dutch national research council funded (NWO) research project. His PhD centres on the concept of sexual citizenship beyond their legal conceptualisation in Curaçao and Bonaire by analysing cultural articulations and practices such as archival collections, literature, theatre, and cultural performance. He investigates how these cultural practices and articulations grapple with recent developments about sexual and gender minority rights, tourism, the colonial relationships with the Netherlands, and their historical legacy. 

Publications include ‘Looking for kambrada: sexuality and social anxieties in the Dutch colonial archive, 1882-1923,’ Tijdschrift voor genderstudies 22 (2): 125–143. This article received an honourable mention for the Gregory Sprague Prize for an outstanding article on LGBT+ and queer history selected by the Committee on LGBT history (2020). Tectum Verlag published his first book, The Question of Dutch Politics as a Matter of Theatre: Theatre and Performance, after the 2008 Financial Crisis in 2017. His other publications focus on LGBT movements in the Netherlands and the former Netherlands Antilles, queer archives, cultural practices and post-colonial intellectuals in the Netherlands.

Reporting from four continents and Oceana, I've also written on health (including mental health), criminal justice, and more. My journalism has appeared in The New Yorker; New York Times Magazine, NYT Science, NYT Business, National Geographic, Scientific American, Wired, Nature, Bloomberg Businessweek, The Guardian (U.K.), Slate, Fast Company, New York, and many others. 

As an editor, my work has been recognized by the Society of Professional Journalists, Society of Environmental Journalists, Association of Health Care Journalists, Columbia University, American Society of Journalists and Authors, Folio: magazine, and the Excellence in Financial Journalism Awards. 

Currently on assignments for Bloomberg News, Hakai, UCLA, and a corporate client. 

When I'm not writing or researching, I'm listening to classic hip-hop and post-punk on vintage hi-fi, paddleboarding the canals of Amsterdam, or helping my teenage daughters realize their dreams of becoming professional perfomers.
