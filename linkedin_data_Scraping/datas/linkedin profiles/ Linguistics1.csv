After my Bachelor’s studies in English Linguistics and Literature, my passion for language and my need to contribute to society's modern demands have turned me towards Language Technology. After all, I strongly believe that (personal) reinvention is the natural outcome of the world's continuous change. My current studies have armoured me with a broad perspective and interdisciplinary skill-set, while the research aspect made be adopt an inquisitive approach to everything, asking questions and working very thoroughly towards the answers. In the course of two years, I have worked with various NLP and Text Mining tasks, such as Sentiment Analysis, Named Entity Recognition, Topic Modelling and Classification, Semantic Role Labelling, Argumentation and Opinion Mining, Coreference Resolution and Conversational Agents. I also took a number of extracurricular course in Knowledge Organization and Data Mining Techniques, where I acquired knowledge in structured databases and worked on a hotel recommender system. Through these tasks I also gained a strong Machine Learning and Deep Learning knowledge. I mostly work in the Python programming Language, but I also have basic experience in R and Java. Finally, during my studies I worked in multiple Teaching Assistant positions that deepened my skills and confidence in them. 


This challenging transition from Linguistics to NLP gave me a strong learning drive and mindset and made me a strong proponent of bridging Humanities with STEM subjects. Every day of my studies is a confirmation of how significant linguistic insight is into making automatic systems more robust, efficient, generalizable and interpretable. At the same time, I also found myself leaning towards the engineering aspect, which is what I intend to pursue careerwise and combine with my linguistic background for a well-rounded and efficient execution."

Three years later, BA in hand, I specialised by doing a master's in English Language&Linguistics. I'm mostly interested in sociolinguistics with a hint of phonology: How are words pronounced, what do people think of that, does the region they live in influence their pronunciation? But basically everything that has to do with language and linguistics sparks my interest.

Since I didn't want to go into education, I had to find different ways to use my talents. I had already tutored many individual pupils in English and I am still occassionally doing this. I've been transcribing old manuscripts for Transcribe Bentham and also for Shakespeare's World. I am proofreading and editing for a student company (AthenaSummary & AthenaCheck) and have done some translation work as well. 

I worked at a homework institute for two years and I loved helping the pupils with their homework through explanation and rehearsing. At the start of 2016, I begun with two internships at Calvijn College: research and editorial. Through both internships I've specialised in directions that I'd love to work in, gaining the experience for future jobs.

Even though I didn't want to go into education, I'm still working close to that branche. Who knows what will happen in the future? For now, I'm focusing on editorial work, but I'd be happy to have any job that concerns language and/or linguistics.
