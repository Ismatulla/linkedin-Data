Since the strength of linguistic typology depends to a large extent on the quality of the grammars which feed the databases, the group has a special interest in all aspects of fieldwork methods and descriptive linguistics from the use of software tools (PRAAT, Language Explorer 8) to standards for data collection and processing, linguistic argumentation and ethical fieldwork. 

And since Austronesian and Melanesian linguistics have a long and strong tradition of cross-disciplinary research focusing on themes shared with anthropologists, archeologists, geneticists, historians and biologists, we also have a special interest in linguistic relationships (areal, genealogical, typological, statistic) as instruments within cross-disciplinary contexts for the study of human prehistory and population movements. Our focus here is on the prehistory and migration paths of the ancestors of Austronesian, Melanesian and Papuan speech communities.

In this school, with the French and English teachers, I organised « The Book Week »

literary movements to present to other students. This experience allowed me to
understand that the process of acquiring language skills can be done in two or three
languages in parallel and effectively.

After that, I moved to France to both improve my French and develop my
teaching skills. I worked as a teacher’s assistant and as a Spanish language acquisition
teacher with students aged 10 to 20. This challenge was both difficult and deeply
rewarding. It made me more than ever an international citizen and enable me to enrich
my professional toolset, especially during the lockdown when I practised remote
teaching.

Languages are my passion and that is the reason why I studied linguistics and
why I moved from Chile to Europe, and now from France to The Netherlands. Since
September I’m following Dutch classes twice a week.

Being an empathic and reflective person, I interact well with large groups of learners and individuals. My whole life I've been working in education, mainly as a language teacher, coach, and educational developer.

Teaching languages is my professional focus and my life passion. I like to think of 'words' being my main tool - to explain, inspire, motivate and discover. I'm able to explain tricky things simply. To listen to another person and to ask the right question at the right moment. I value an individual, goal-oriented and creative approach when organizing learning processes.
 
I enjoy being part of a team, but I'm also disciplined enough to work remotely. I conduct independent research and develop learning materials and tailor-made courses. 

Currently, I'm working at a big project for a German university (Landesinstitut für Schulqualität und Lehrerbildung Sachsen-Anhalt), which will be finished soon. Looking forward to cooperating! So, don't hesitate to contact me."

I primarily work in British English, but I also accept American English assignments. I translate English - Dutch and Dutch - English. Even though I am a Dutch native, I've started learning English from a very early age and have mastered the language at a native speaker level. I am actively looking for freelance assignments or employment as a translator and editor. 

Actively looking for:
- Copy, line, and developmental editing, proofreading assignments of academic English.
- Copy, line, and developmental editing, proofreading assignments of English literary texts.
- Copy, line, and developmental editing, proofreading assignments of English commercial texts.
- Translation assignments of academic texts, English-Dutch or Dutch-English
- Translation assignments of literary texts, English-Dutch or Dutch-English
- Translation assignments of commercial texts, English-Dutch or Dutch-English

I accept copy editing, line editing, developmental editing, and proofread assignments of academic English texts within the humanities. Developmental editing includes support with the understanding of complex primary and secondary literature, improving the argumentation and overall readability of the text. I work with texts according to the MLA, CMS, and APA style guides. 

I accept copy editing, line editing, developmental editing, and proofread assignments of English fiction of all genres. With fiction, developmental editing includes support with plot structure, character arcs, the overall readability and flow of the story, whether your foreshadowing pays off or is too obvious, and whether you hook the reader sufficiently for them to keep reading between chapters. I also accept texts that aren't strictly fiction, such as blog posts, websites, letters, etc. 

I accept translation assignments in the above criteria, both Dutch to English and English to Dutch. 

I am an avid reader of both classical and genre fiction. I also hope to someday publish my own novel. While I spend my days of filling page upon page with my own stories, in my professional life I support writers of novels or writers who write about novels, history, philosophy, and language within the humanities, or I help people like yourself find that perfect book in their local library or aid in the conservation of historical texts in research libraries or archives.  In this manner, my whole life can be captured between the pages of a book. "
