Radboud University Nijmegen. Title PhD thesis: 'The Rise of the Professional Author: The Life and Work of Sir Walter Besant' 
Now available via Amazon.co.uk

Apart from being a prolific author, historian, philanthropist and critic, Sir Walter Besant (1836-1901) was a major force in the professionalisation of authorship. In 1884 he founded the ‚ÄòSociety of Authors‚Äô, and six years later he launched the monthly periodical The Author, the organ of this society. Although nowadays largely forgotten or marginalised, Besant played a central role in late Victorian literary life. He was indefatigable in his campaigns for the improvement of the position of authors, but also habitually took part in the many great literary debates of his time. It should be emphasised, however, that this thesis is far more than a mere life story; it can best be described as a meta-biography: through the focus on the life of this literary figure this study describes the infrastructure of the late-Victorian literary world at a time of dramatic change. Against the backdrop of the explosively expanding book trade of the second half of the nineteenth century it studies the literary field and the relations between authors, publishers and--new on the scene--literary agents. It analyses the literary, artistic and political networks that shaped the discourses of the final two decades of the nineteenth century, thereby combining various research strategies from archival research (manuscripts and ego-documents), historical contextualisation and theoretical perspectives."

In june 2017 I finished two (post) Master programs to become a qualified higher level high school teacher (eerstegraads bevoegdheid) in both economics (Economie) and business economics (M&O). I enjoy working with and helping young people on the subjects which I enjoy.

My goals are:
- To sparkle enthusiasm amongst others
- To learn new things, as well as to share my own knowledge and ideas
- To keep challenging myself and my environment

Interests
I am a former board member of debating society T.D.V. Cicero (Treasurer, Dutch: Penningmeester). Debating is a skill that grants many tools to excel in clear communication and public speaking.
Whatever the subject, the critical-thinking skills and deliberative process inherent in debate are valuable for learning and personal growth.

As a board member, I was involved with multiple events. I facilitated the Dutch Debating Winter School, the Cicero-tournament and Women's Open tournament. These events attracted international attention.
I was one of the main organizers of the Groot Tilburg Scholieren Debat (GTSD). I enjoyed this specifically because it lies at the intersection of two of my interests: high school teaching and debating.

As of now I am working at a high school called 'Het Norbertusgertrudislyceum', in which I teach economics to students aged 16 - 19.

Besides that, I like being active in sports. I play football and visit the gym regularly. Next to that, I enjoy reading. I believe that reading offers great opportunity to learn and grow, as books often contain messages from people with a lifetime experience within specific fields.

I PRACTICE TRANSFORMATION DESIGN

Transformation design seeks to create desirable and sustainable changes in behavior and form ‚Äì of individuals, systems and organizations. It is a multi-stage, iterative process of applying design principles to large and complex systems.

In the past 20 years, I have gained broad expertise on topics such as transformation design, digital society, UX, human(ity) and life centered design. I believe in the creation of a 'global learning society' to ignite transformation towards a better world.  

CO-FOUNDER DIGITAL SOCIETY SCHOOL & GLOBAL GOALS JAM

I have co-founded and currently co-direct Digital Society School (25 staff, 100 trainees/year) within Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. I co-initiated the widely used Design Method Toolkit, the global Design Across Cultures programme and the growing social movement of the Global Goals Jam. The latter with the United Nations Development Programme: 90+ cities and over 5000 design activists that use their creative skills for the benefit of the SDG's and society. 

EDUCATOR & ACTiVE COMMUNITY MEMBER

I am a Community Liaison for the World Design Organization, advocating life-long learning and promoting design for the SDG's. I am also a proud advisory board member for DOT in Spain and visiting professor at IE University in Madrid. 

KEYNOTE SPEAKER and MODERATOR

I have addressed and engaged diverse audiences on stages large and small around the world, such as in Spain, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Germany, UK, Chile, Mexico, the US, S. Korea, Japan, China, South Africa, Rwanda and many more.

DESIGNER FOR EXPERIENCES/ EMOTIONS
