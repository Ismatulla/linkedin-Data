Over the years I realized how immensely easy I am to communicate and I started my life as a temporary soccer team voluntary guide in 2009.

Later I worked as a receptionist and waitress at the counter / table, where the daily contact with the public is necessary.
 To broaden my range of professional experience, I decided to work as a collaborator in the stores Calzedonia and Parfois. I learned marketing techniques - persuasion and manipulation - that are very useful in the communications field. Mastering the art of rhetoric is essential to manipulate and persuade customers. Team spirit was also an acquired core competency and facilitates daily interpersonal relationships.

 Inter-cultural awareness and pedagogical skills in the EAP classroom, specifically focusing on Chinese academic degree-seekers in Anglophone programs and academies.

Since 2010, following from my ancillary university focus on Chinese language and culture, I and my colleagues Dr. Mark Vitullo and Dr. Yao (Amy) Hsiao have been involved in several projects relating to Chinese exchange students and their English language acquisition and production skills within the Anglophone academic environment (specifically EAP writing/oral skills at Tilburg University). We are currently exploring the practical English language acquisition and production difficulties with which these students struggle and which hinder their success in Anglophone programs. 

Our goal is twofold:
1)	 To offer EAP (English for academic purposes) university teachers information about certain Chinese (Mandarin) language characteristics, Chinese rhetorical essay structures and logical conventions of idea development that Chinese exchange students learn in China. This information should enable the EAP teacher to identity and modify potential interference patterns during EAP courses.
2)	To develop practical classroom methods to support and coach Chinese exchange students more efficiently and effectively so that they can acquire the academic English skills they need to succeed in the global, primarily Anglophone, academic environment. 
My academic interest in this has its root in my Bachelor‚Äôs education in Asian Studies, as well as my current work with Chinese PhD candidates at Tilburg University.

During my undergraduate education, I took several courses in Mandarin Chinese. I have now resumed Mandarin language classes to gain a better insight into basic Mandarin  structures and pronunciation.

Knowing that the things I do, whether this is at work or in private life, directly or indirectly contribute something positive to others and society, makes my sincerely happy. 
In my field of study this is translated to a desire to improve and maintain good (intercultural) communication between people and businesses (or communication within businesses). Both my English and Intercultural Communication studies gave me a strong theoretical foundation to work from. This theoretical foundation is enriched with practical experience: during my stay abroad in Cambridge I had the role of mediator between international professors and students, and during my internship I had the role of consultant for communication and diversity policy. Also, I am currently working as a communication advisor for Stichting Present Den Haag, where I handle both external (website, social media, ads, flyers, newsletter etc) and internal communication. 

I am inquisitive, socially conscious and I take on every challenge with an enthousiastic hands-on mentality. My work experience with colleagues and children demanded flexibility and being creative; working in a dynamic environment therefore, isn't new to me. Furthermore, I am quite the perfectionist, which results in both accuracy and success.

I was one of the main organizers of the 2017 conference ‚ÄòLook both ways: narrative and metaphor in education‚Äô (an edited volume stemming from this conference was published with Routledge) and the ALA2018 conference ‚ÄòTowards Language Aware Citizenship‚Äô.
