Attention to the patient’s history belongs in this context. What did it mean to be ill in Graeco-Roman Antiquity? How did patients and doctors communicate? How can we grasp the different rationalities that were active in ancient medicine? I am also interested in the history of ideas. Medical anatomical and and physiological concepts, ideas and terminology play an important role as they ‘dripped down’ into literature and society up to the Early Modern Era. My main research project is patient’s history in a comparative perspective: „Seeing Patients“.

Specialties: History of Ancient Medicine

Having spent a year at KU Leuven University on an Erasmus scholarship during the initial stages of my education, I decided to return to Leuven for a master's degree in Linguistics, which I obtained with a specialization in Diachronic and Comparative Linguistics in 2016. Subsequently, I joined the Friedrich-Schiller-Universität (Jena) as a Marie Curie Early Stage Researcher in the DComm project, studying for a PhD degree under the supervision of prof. Holger Diessel. In my thesis, which focused on demonstratives, I combined a typological investigation of demonstrative systems worldwide with a more in-depth study of the Latin demonstratives. Having finished my thesis, I joined the University of Amsterdam in September 2019 as a postdoctoral researcher in the Anchoring Innovation project, focusing on Latin. In my work, I aim to combine my knowledge of general linguistics and pragmatics with my passion for Ancient Greek and Latin literature."
