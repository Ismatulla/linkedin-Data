I am almost thirty and still don't really know what I want to do. I've tried many jobs and gigs and found a plethora of passions. I currently live in The Netherlands with my partner, but my Dutch is coming along slowly. I am looking for remote or volunteer positions. I plan to move back to America in roughly a year. 

A quick synopsis: I graduated  Cal Poly with a BA in Political Science (Psychology Minor).I worked at my university's Disability Resource Center for six years during and after college. I was a capable employee and had many responsibilities and positions (see resume). 

Most of my experience involves human services and education. I have seven years of experience working and volunteering with people with disabilities. I've also taught for six years in Minnesota, California, and Japan. I currently tutor Chinese children online. It's been said that I am good with children (and dogs). 

Some concrete metrics for you: Graduated Summa Cum Laude, DRC Employee of the Year,  2,000 Uber rides with a 4.92 rating. 1,000 hours of online tutoring with a perfect rating, hundreds of dogs watched with a perfect rating (plus lots of joy), and 300,000 ''energy points'' on Kahn Academy. 

Strengths: I have experience with many different communities. I love learning, teaching, and communicating. I'm probably not the hardest working person ever, but I am dedicated, dependable, and strive to overcome challenges. I take commitments very seriously. I have a good education in politics, finance, history, and psychology. I have been a good to excellent employee for every company that I've worked for. I've also never been fired.

Weaknesses: indecision (see resume). Anxiety, particular with public speaking. I have negative physical responses to speaking publicly such as sweaty hands and dry mouth. I've generally been able to overcome this and have given presentations to hundreds of people. However, I do not naturally inspire confidence as a public speaker (yet). This can also be an annoying barrier in interviews.  

Values: honesty, efficiency, communication, resilience, and humor. 

Goals: I would like to consume less, learn more, encourage healthy relationships, and help a company that 
helps people. 

Thank you for reading if you've made it this far! I hope that you found this sincere and not glib or disrespectful. I promise that I can be respectful and professional."

After having completed some time at Wilmington University I decided to stop and move to Florence, Italy. It was 2012 and I wanted to study so that I could teach English as a foreign language.
My first teaching experiences were in Rome, Italy, where I taught English to childen, as well as business English to adults, for a little over four years. I taught in language centers and was also contracted out to public schools as well as business offices. In my free time I explored and photographed the city, while taking in all the history and wine I could. In my later years in Rome I was able to become a tour guide for a travel bus tour that visited different important historical locations in the city. In 2016 I moved to the Netherlands, where I worked with the Dutch catering company Vermaat, at one point becoming assistant manager at Vermaat's McKinsey & Company location. I spent a year in Holland before deciding that I wanted to go back to teaching English, so I set out to Beijing, China. In my one year there I taught English at Pumpkin Pie Kindergarten, and then left to help my friends and colleagues set up and start their own English school, Lighthouse English. 
I am currently the manager for the online English school connected with Lighthouse English School, and am responsible for all things relating to the English teaching staff.
Over my years of experience I believe that I have developed skills which enable me to give educational courses with a level of comfort and fun that helps the students to relax and enjoy the process of learning, rather than stress it.

Before I started teaching as a profession - and before realizing that this is my true passion - I had worked as a temp in different positions at one of the most prestigious multinational companies of the time in Hungary while doing my university studies. I am extremely grateful for these years as I gained a tremendous amount of experience in very diverse fields such as HR (training and recruitment), payroll, secretarial jobs, customer care, and even warehouse work. It armed me with adaptability, flexibility, and a skill set that is applicable in any job. However, after having graduated I decided to leave corporate culture and start teaching English as a foreign language.

As a teacher, I have always been proactive and innovative inside and outside the classroom to see how either the learning process or the learning environment can be developed and to make learning more effective and more fun. I never do routine classes and engage my students in the work so that they can reach the clearly defined goals we set together.

As I have encountered hundreds and hundreds of different students during the course of my work, all with different needs, I had to become some sort of a jack of all trades (and hopefully a master of some).  I helped many trainers and training companies translate, compile, and present training sessions and have acquired a great deal of knowledge in the field in the meantime. I believe that having taught outside the traditional school setting has a beneficial effect on my school classes as well because I am constantly aware of what language knowledge the market requires. At the same time, I also enjoy taking a scholarly approach to language learning and deal with English literature, linguistics or history.

Around 15 years ago I shifted my focus to special needs teaching and tried to see where the opportunities lie in using special needs methodologies in language teaching. In 2012 I decided to establish a language center with my best friend, where we focused on learners who cannot excel in the traditional group or classroom setting. Although this enterprise proved to be the most rewarding and most successful thing I had ever done, I had to give it up when we decided to start a new life in The Hague in August 2019. 

Now it seems I will have to start building everything up from scratch, but who doesn't like some good old-fashioned challenge?"

After having lived abroad for 18 years, as an expat in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Israel and Italy, I returned to my home country in 2008. Because I completed a History Master before leaving, I came up with the idea of becoming a history teacher. But while I was studying for my teacher’s degree, I saw  the opportunity to start working as a teacher of Dutch as a second language, to people from abroad. I enjoyed it so much, that I decided to give it my full 100%.
I became a certified professional, started my own business in Dutch language training, and gained lots of experience in teaching different target groups at all levels. I worked at Jules (mostly University students), at Vluchtelingenwerk and Speak and Connect (refugees) and at ROC Leeuwenborgh (mixed migrants). I did literacy and integration programs, all levels from A0 to B2. For my own business I trained managers and expats in companies.
I worked with volunteers, trainees and coached new teachers. I made new teaching materials, developed tests, did intakes, coordinated and organized courses, took care of customer service, finance, marketing, public relations, website management and social media.
Now I am ready for a job as an advisor in NT2 teaching, a senior teacher, an intercultural coach or a leading position in a small language school.

A reliable, authentic and open but also eager to learn about new methods and techniques of teaching person.
As a professional, I had a chance to work with various types of students, including ones with disabilities. My aim was to help both students achieve their goals by creating an inclusive and encouraging learning environment that was full of interaction and positive energy. I taught students of all ages. Starting from three years old children to working with adults attempting to pass language certificates or school leaving exams. Currently, I am working as a high school teacher in a school for kids with special sporting talents. 
Working with sports teenage students is very challenging. In many cases I have to adjust the teaching programme and methods to their needs but at the same time I try to help them to achieve the highest results at “Matura”- Polish school leaving exam (equivalent of the A-levels). I have participated in a lot of school projects.
I keep myself updated with current technologies and teaching methods, so when covid-19 pandemic appeared, I started teaching online instantly with positive feedback from my students. In addition, I learned how to use various teaching platforms and how to prepare online tests, at the same time maintaining the highest levels of integration during the classes. I use google platform classroom and Microsoft Teams in online education, as well as Zoom and WebEx.
I’m a certified examiner of A-level English exam as well as “egzamin ósmoklasisty”, which is the equivalent of the British GCSE English exam. I prepared a number of reports concerning the results of secondary and primary school leaving exams and I took part in a number of trainings and workshops.
In addition to my job as a high school teacher, in October 2007 I started my own company after discovering a great teaching method for toddlers called “The land of fairy tales”  The programme consists of four levels and four books. Children aged 2 until 5 or 6 can learn English through a set of popular and specially adapted fairy tales. Children learn vocabulary from colourful flashcards, which helps attracting their attention. The flashcard had a word drawn, written on them so from the early age they realize that written and spoken English differs. The new vocabulary is also revised in context via songs, poems and finger games with loads of rhymes to stimulate kids’ memory.

⋙ Being a teacher means 𝙘𝙤𝙣𝙣𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙞𝙣𝙜: you need to create a solid bond with your students so that the needs of both parties are satisfied.
⋙ Being a teacher also means 𝙚𝙣𝙩𝙚𝙧𝙩𝙖𝙞𝙣𝙞𝙣𝙜: you are the person who translates knowledge that already appears in books. Your students are there watching 𝘠𝘖𝘜, listening to 𝘠𝘖𝘜. Therefore, they deserve that you present this knowledge putting all your desire, your energy and your passion to give your best show. Each class is like a play and you are a key part of the performance.

So for me the most important thing about being a teacher is not just accumulating degrees and knowledge to explain and show students how much we know. In fact, for me that is the base, a necessary percentage but not the main thing. The magic is in the 𝗛𝗢𝗪. How do you explain it?  How do you do it? How do you connect? How do you entertain?

The subjects that we explain will always be similar, but every day is different because each student is different, unique and special. That is the real challenge and that is why I 𝘭𝘰𝘷𝘦 being a teacher. I can't imagine working on anything else: 𝘴𝘩𝘰𝘸 𝘮𝘶𝘴𝘵 𝘨𝘰 𝘰𝘯."

I grew up in a standard low-middle-class family. We had to tighten our belts for all the small things. But not for books. My parents were factory workers and believed in education. I don’t remember any lavish holidays, but I can still recall the smell of an old encyclopedia my mother had bought in installments.

Learning changed my life for the better. My hometown was a boring place in the middle of nowhere, tarnished by several economic crises. People had dull jobs, not particularly skilled, for all their life. I strived for more. This attitude helped me to achieve my educational goals and shape my current job.

Resilience is something different. It is a process of trial and error: you get it through life experiences. In 2008, the global financial crisis propelled budget cuts at my university and I had to change my educational path. I had enrolled to become an IT expert and educator in Digital Forensics and the cuts transformed it in a standard Law course with glimpses of general programming.

After having earned my Bachelor's in Legal informatics, it was time to change everything: I started to travel more, learned new languages; moved to another city, and started a new Bachelor’s in Foreign Languages. I wanted to be a Linguist and a Language Teacher. And I did it. 👨🏻‍🏫

But, as I stressed before, resilience is a tangible skill. You learn it on the field. My latest field was the pandemic in March 2020. I was a University Lecturer in Russia when everything was shut down, including my job. I had to rearrange it, if I wanted to keep my career. I learned to communicate online, and more about sales and marketing to become a full-time online language tutor, creating my own business.

I survived thanks to my resilience, but my drive to learn new things led me to another career: Data Analyst 📈. Why?  Because I’ve always loved data analysis: from my first BA in IT and Law to my internship as an accountant, to my research in Applied Linguistics. Understanding data is another way to educate myself and spread knowledge, as I’ve always done.

Over the past 6 months, I got more and more expert in Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau. I earned many certificates, including Start2Impact University’s Master's. In other words, I got hooked.

I’m an extravert, enthusiastic guide/interpreter/presenter( in 5 languages) and language teacher, who learned a lot from various international job experiences (mainly in communication) and from people with various nationalities from various social backgrounds.

One of my favourite roles so far was the one at the prestigious champagnehouse Moët et Chandon in France, where I was a guide/interpreter in the chic setting of the champagnehouse. I enjoyed informing the overall attentive international audience about the house, its region and the elaboration process of champagne in 4/5 languages. Another great role was the one as a presenter for a radio station where I established several contacts with hotels, organisations and shops. 

Some of my work experiences are not mentioned on this Linkedin CV as they were of temporary duration.

Feel free to write me in order to discuss good  and honest work opportunities. Honesty, inegrity and the willingness to help others grow by advising them, are important values to me and I would be happy if we could work together properly in such a setting.

My hobbies are: Discovering new cultures, music ( I play saxophone)  and sports.

I would like to end with my slogan: Keep up the good work, improve yourself every day!
Best Regards,
Bjorn"

After three years I took a year out to travel in South East Asia before securing a teaching position as a primary school teacher at Dulwich College Suzhou in China. After two years there, I started a company in Shanghai teaching mindfulness in international schools as well as working as a private ESL tutor. In 2020, I moved to The Netherlands where I am currently self-employed teaching ESL and children's mindfulness part-time whilst looking after my toddler twins. Very recently, I also completed a masters in Character Education from the University of Birmingham.

Over the years my interest in moral education has grown. I am interested in the questions: How can we help young people to learn wisdom so that they can become resilient and ethical decision makers?  How can we live well together in a pluralist world? How can we develop character and wellbeing in an ever-demanding education system? My masters in Character Education has set me on a path of findings the answers to these questions so that I can help schools adjust their teaching and learning through research informed development approaches.

I am now looking for part-time employment in training or consultancy so that I can pass on all the expertise I've gained from my masters. I would be very interested to hear from schools or educational organisations with whom I can work to help develop wellbeing and character programmes and curricula."
