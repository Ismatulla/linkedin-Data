During my PhD at Aarhus University, I investigated how Arctic soil microbiomes react to the ongoing climate change in terms of rising temperatures, changed precipitation patterns and soil profile disruptions through thermokarsts through next-generation sequencing, thermally controlled incubations and gas flux observations. Furthermore I engage in scientific outreach such as for Greenland Ecosystem Monitoring.

Formerly I graduated in EMBC+: European Master of Marine Biodiversity and Conservation, within which my Master thesis focused on transcriptomic analysis of thermally stressed Arctic copepods. Since then, genetic tools became the baseline and main goal of my research.

I am passionate about creating collaborations across disciplines and with that foster more connection among scientists. As such, I was a representative of APECS Denmark, as well as part of the EGU and APECS Mental Health Project groups. I started the ""Mindful Scientist"" blog (https://mindfulscientistblog.wordpress.com/) to promote the discussion about mental health in academia and also led a ""Mindful Hour"" session and talk during the vEGU 2021.

Communicating science engagingly is exciting and needed, so I joined the EGU Cryosphere blog team first as author (https://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/cr/2021/10/22/its-getting-hot-in-here-ancient-microbes-in-thawing-permafrost/), then editor and now temporary chief-editor."

My current research interests are agricultural economies, archaeobotany (the study of human-plant relationships in the past), crop selection, ethnographic studies of traditional food practices, and food security of both the present day and in the past.

I am a very curious person. I love learning, especially new practical skills. ""A jack of all trades and a master of none..."". That is a quote I lived by for a long time - but people usually forget about the rest of this quote: ""...is still better than a master of one"". 
I figured out what I want to be the true master of: The master of using all my different skills in a creative and innovative way to bring on new perspectives and solutions. And making science understandable and more approachable for people. 
If I do not know how to do something, I learn it. And that has brought me to a place where it is easier for me to see connections and pick up new skills. My dad was an engineer and my mother a psychologist so they both taught me since a young age to keep an open mind and try different approaches to problems.

Besides studying towards the Bachelor's degree and two very demanding Master programmes, I have also worked as a teacher of both Greek and Dutch for 3 years. This experience filled me with even greater enthusiasm for the field of language in general, but also with a special intellectual inquisitiveness and passion for pursuing a career in education.

Since the beginning of 2016, I have been working as a Classics teacher at secondary schools in the Netherlands, where I teach Ancient Greek and Latin language and culture to high-school students (in Dutch). This experience increased my passion for education even more, for I realized I have the ability to inspire young learners about the Classical world the way I was inspired in high-school. Furthermore, I came to realize that working with young adults means so much more than teaching, for it involves guidance, understanding, inspiration and encouragement, as well as recognition of every student's capabilities, talents, and achievements.

As an education professional my ambition is to contribute to youth development with a focus on character formation. I enjoy helping young adults to envision their future and to develop a plan in order to realize their vision. 

My most important aspiration is to be given the opportunity to offer my enthusiasm and passion for 
helping and guiding students in their study choices and support them towards a successful academic path.
