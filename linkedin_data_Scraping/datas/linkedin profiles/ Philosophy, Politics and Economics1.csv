I like to apply complex state-of-the-art techniques, but I ensure that the simple solution is not overlooked, which might give the same or better results. That is what counts for me: the result.

In my work, I put much consideration in the social aspects of data. On the surface, data might look objective and the analysis thereof seems pure mathematics. However, as people are the topic of the data most of the time, there is more psychology in data than you might think. The story behind the data becomes clearer when taking this into account. 

Finally, I like being involved with data ethics, for example GDPR or how to apply responsible AI. This way, I combine my background in econometrics, psychology and philosophy in my work as Data Scientist."
