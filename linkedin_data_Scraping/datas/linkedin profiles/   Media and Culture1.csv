I realized that this is what I want to be and began to specialize in being exactly that, a generalist. I am someone who can help you with many different aspects of communication. I love a challenge and always give everything. Because of this, I make sure that I turn any challenge or adventure that I step into a success.

I am a communication professional with different specializations in communication. For example, I graduated in communication science in July 2022, from Radboud University Nijmegen. Before that, I obtained my communication bachelor's degree at Fontys Hogeschool in Eindhoven. I learned to master the various psychological and practical aspects of communication during my studies. This ranges from setting up a social media campaign or creating a brand strategy, and understanding customer mindsets to positioning and branding a company, writing a communication plan for a new business, or dealing with cross-cultural relationships. These are also some of my favorite things within communications.

During my studies, I had experiences in Mexico and the United States. These experiences taught me how to become more aware of cultural differences and how to respond to them as a communication professional. Here I also learned how to work in a hectic environment, partly by graduating during the COVID-19 pandemic in a foreign country and completing a master's degree in uncertain times. This has ensured that I know how to handle stress and chaos, and still deliver a quality product. I am proud of this because it shows my perseverance and eye for detail.

During my studies, I worked as a social media manager, and I still do today. Here I help companies set up a comprehensive, executable social media plan with which they can achieve business goals. These goals can vary from more brand awareness to more customers or a better connection with regular customers. I also work as a copywriter where I help businesses write blogs, newsletters, website copy, and other textual content.

SUMMARY: I have a broad experience with all aspects of marketing communication: from brand positioning to campaign management. Online and offline, ATL and BTL. And I worked in tv and media, arts and publishing. 
 
What I love to do? I love to help brands breaking through the clutter. I believe brands should strain to disrupt and conquer in communications using both standard and unconventional methods across media channels. Successfull communication does not stop at a tv commercial, print ad or Instastory, it’s just the starting point. All the way to the CTA-button, Happy to welcome you-email and further proof of your brand idea. With all the tech available today, be it in media channels or in the UX/UI of an app, the possibilities are nearly limitless to make an impact. Even without throwing lots of money in marketing campaigns. 

And further? Making an impact for the underdog. I’m very much result oriented. What’s the uptake in visitors, in sales, in landing page views, etc.?  But also seeing people (including myself) grow and develop, becoming better every day. Trying to deliver the best they (and I) can.

What kind of manager am I? I believe in engagement at work. That is what I’m striving for to realize in my teams. By making people responsible, energizing them, by helping and supporting them and by celebrating their successes. But I’m also not afraid for a though and frank discussion.

 What do I bring as a colleague? I bring along a high level of energy and drive. And humor (but off course that’s a matter of taste ;)). I am a responsible gal, for the business, for my projects, for my colleagues and for my team.  What’s perfect small talk to use when meeting me? I love arts. A good movie or a music album. A funny meme. A picture, video or just a story about puppy dogs."
