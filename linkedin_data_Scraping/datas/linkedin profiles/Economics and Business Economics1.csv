Having lived in Greece, the US, the Netherlands, and Switzerland has deepened this interest, as I have observed the effects of the economy on the standards of living and human behavior in general.

My focus on healthcare started while I studied in Canada for a semester, I followed an introductory course in Health Economics and set out to focus on that field of study. This is why I started my master in Health Economics at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam in September 2021. I kept asking myself the question: What would a transparent healthcare system look like? 

To learn more about the field of healthcare and what it is like to work in a hospital, I worked at the CWZ hospital in Nijmegen, on topics such as e-health, patient satisfaction and user friendly patient portals. 

Next to healthcare, economics is a topic close to my heart. Because of this, I was a member of Rethinking Economics NL. Here, I hosted the Rethinking Podcast, which you can find on the website of Rethinking Economics NL, where I got to talk to experts in the economic field that can change your perspective, if you’re willing to listen. These experts were from many fields and all over the world, with interesting topics for everyone. 

Another organization I closely worked with is Our New Economy, a for-purpose organization that wants to propel forward into the new economy, and put the wellbeing of citizens at the centre of the economy. With them I worked on creating educational material and an online workshop about the New Economy. 

Around all this is my love for reading and my curiosity for people. I would like to finish with the fact that I like to listen. If you want to link and chat, or if you are up for a cup of tea, let's share stories and learn from one another. I am a village girl who is living in the city, if you look me in the eyes, I will say Hi, because that is the kind of person I am.

In my work on climate change adaptation, I examine the relationship between financial constraints and optimal adaptation to physical climate risk at the household level.  I study the dynamic consequences on housing, income, and wealth inequality, and evaluate the design and political feasibility of policies aimed at alleviating the effects associated with financial constraints.
As financial factors shape the transition to a sustainable and low-carbon economy, I also study the interaction between financial frictions and climate transition risk at the corporate level. I examine how these frictions affect the pace of the green transition and explore the impact on the pricing and ownership dynamics of corporate bonds.

I hold an MPhil in Economics from Tinbergen Institute (with distinction), a Bachelor of Science in Economics (with highest distinction) and a Bachelor in Law from Erasmus University Rotterdam.

My friends and colleagues describe me as proactive, creative, and trustworthy. In my relationship with others, integrity, openness, and joy are of great importance to me. 

 If I may paraphrase Barack Obama, it does not matter to me what wealth, status, power, or fame we have, what truly matters is how well we have loved and what small part we play in making the lives of other people better. With that in mind, not only will we thrive, but it will bring everyone's #wellbeing, and that of the planet, to a liveable standard for generations to come. 

Ever since I can remember, I enjoy solving puzzles, and that is exactly what I do. Whether it is connecting people with people across different networks and organisations at Wellbeing Economy Alliance Nederland or connecting the dots in complex business data flows at cpmview, I love creating synergies and insights that previously did not exist, bringing a collective vision to collective action. 

I want companies to transition to better #sustainablebusinessmanagement. But how can they do that, with all these time-consuming manual reporting processes, affecting the integrity of their financial and sustainability data? Not being able to make reliable strategic decisions? 

With the changing regulatory landscape for reporting processes, companies face many challenges regarding #datagovernance. Integrating financial and #sustainabilityreporting, and streamlining reporting processes for two equally important drivers of business performance, will prevent disconnected processes, saving both time and money. Ultimately, leading to more confident and satisfied employees. It allows them to trust their data and gain better insights into their business operation and performance, leading to #sustainablebusinessmanagement."
