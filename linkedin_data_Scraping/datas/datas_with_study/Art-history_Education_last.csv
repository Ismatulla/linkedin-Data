Are you an innovative, experienced and inspiring scholar in the field of the history of art and architecture between 500-1500? Do your research and teaching explore cross-cultural connections and expand or complicate the geographical and cultural boundaries of the 'medieval'? As a full professor at Radboud University, you will join and lead a diverse group of dedicated scholars, shape the field of art and architectural history, and flourish in a friendly and vibrant academic community.

The History of Art section at Radboud University is looking for a Full Professor of History of Art and Architecture between 500-1500 CE (1,0 FTE). The position builds on the section's existing strengths, which includes visual and material culture of Europe after 1500 CE, architecture, and global modern and contemporary art.
You are an art historian whose research explores cross-cultural connections and links historical research to contemporary issues and practices, such as cultural heritage. Our section is especially interested in scholars whose research and teaching expand or complicate the geographical and cultural boundaries of the 'medieval', who incorporate new methodologies, and whose interests include Islamic Art and Architecture, materiality and craft (including modern material-technical research), or the social uses and sensory experiences of works of art.

As a Professor of History of Art and Architecture at Radboud University, you will build on your robust and innovative research agenda, track record of outstanding scholarly publications, and other academic achievements on an international level. You will develop cross-disciplinary collaborations through innovative teaching and research, mentoring, and forging links with students and faculty across the university and beyond.

At Radboud University, you will take on a leadership role in your field of expertise and present a strong vision of its future development. You will play a dynamic and proactive role in the Radboud Institute for Culture and History (RICH), one of the Faculty's research institutes, contributing to its mission and research programme by participating in and further stimulating its research activities, publishing in high-impact journals and other research outlets, recruiting and supervising PhD candidates, mentoring junior faculty members, and applying for grants.

The professorship is part of the Department of History, Art History and Classics, one of three departments comprising the Faculty of Arts. You will represent the Art History section within the university and beyond, serve as its head in a rotating fashion with one other full professor, and work in close connection with its staff members and with the Department as a whole. You will be joining a university with expertise in Mediterranean Studies (both in the Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of Philosophy, Theology and Religious Studies). You will be expected to serve as a standard bearer for student recruitment, and take on a crucial role in the promotion and visibility of medieval visual and material cultures, both nationally and internationally.

FTE: 0,8 - 1
Job description
The Department of Philosophy at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam has a vacancy for a PhD researcher on a project related to “Cooperation and Rationality”.


Possible projects: in many situations, agents often have reasons both for and against cooperating. What makes cooperation nevertheless successful? This question can be approached both descriptively and normatively. In the descriptive realm, empirical research has looked at investigating the factors that foster cooperation. In the normative domain, philosophical work has been dedicated to discussing various conceptions of rationality. We invite projects situated at the interface of these two fields, which raises questions such as: Which conception(s) of rationality are actually at work in empirical studies of cooperation? And which ones would be best suited for understanding cooperation?


The PhD project will be carried out in close collaboration with and will be supervised by dr. Jelle de Boer, dr. Lisa Bastian and prof. dr. Lieven Decock.

Requirements
the candidate has a (preferably Research) Master degree in Philosophy or Economics/Behavioral Science, attained before September 1, 2023
the candidate has a Master degree or a Bachelor degree in Philosophy or in PPE
the candidate has affinity with analytic philosophy, decision/game theory, and empirical studies of cooperation (as shown in grade transcripts, final thesis, and curriculum vitae)
excellent spoken and written English as well as strong academic writing skills are essential
What are we offering?
A challenging position in a socially involved organization. The salary will be in accordance with university regulations for academic personnel and amounts € 2,541 (PhD) per month during the first year and increases to € 3,247 (PhD) per month during the fourth year, based on a full-time employment. The job profile is based on the university job ranking system and is vacant for at least 0.8 FTE.


The appointment will initially be for 1 year. After a satisfactory evaluation of the initial appointment, the contract will be extended for a total duration of 4 years (or 5 years in case of a 0.8 FTE contract).


Additionally, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam offers excellent fringe benefits and various schemes and regulations to promote a good work/life balance, such as:

Moreover, they will be teaching in a dynamic context in which new methods are being developed. Art and Culture Studies at UvA is a large and highly successful academic department that connects research and teaching in Art History, Cultural Studies, Theater Studies, Music Studies, Heritage and Memory Studies, and Museum Studies.

Tasks and responsibilities:
designing and conducting independent research in the area of Cultural Economy within the University of Amsterdam;

The successful candidate’s teaching portfolio should complement and add to the existing courses, while also responding to growing student interest in Cultural Economy.
Your publications show broad, critical knowledge of the cultural and creative sectors, and the role played by the economy and financial cultural and arts practices, and vice versa.

The Faculty of Humanities, Leiden Institute for Area Studies (LIAS) is looking for a postdoctoral researcher to focus on the influence of the Purāṇas on the literary and material cultures of Southeast Asia for the ERC Advanced Grant project “PURANA – Mythical Discourse and Religious Agency in the Puranic Ecumene” (grant number 101054849).
Project Description
The Purāṇas constitute the most voluminous and enduring genre of Sanskrit literature. While many important Purāṇas were first recorded and circulated in the first millennium CE, the genre has remained a living tradition through the colonial period until the present day. Despite the tradition’s centrality for cultural production in South Asia, we know very little about their historical embeddedness. PURANA makes a critical intervention in the field by tracing the composition, transmission, translation, and agency of the Purāṇas as a transregional and transhistorical process involving multiple actors, audiences, and geographic contexts. Adopting a longue durée perspective, we argue that the Purāṇas’ mythical discourse underlies and unites the religio-political culture of the Sanskrit Cosmopolis—establishing what we call a ‘Puranic Ecumene’: a vast part of the inhabited premodern world united by a distinctive mythical discourse, a hegemonic vision of the integration of society and cosmos, and a remarkable way of anchoring the present in the continuing ancient past.
Key Responsibilities
The postdoctoral researcher will carry out research on the reception and re-creation of Indic Puranic narratives in Southeast Asian literary and material culture. While the Old Javanese Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa appears to be a unique case of direct translation of a known Sanskrit Purāṇa into Old Javanese, court poetry (Kakawin) in general attests to the massive impact of the Purāṇas on Javanese religion and society. Reception of Puranic narratives is also attested in epigraphic sources, temple arts, and iconographic programmes. The ideal candidate would make use of the large collection of Old Javanese manuscripts and Southeast Asian archival materials in the Leiden University Library special collections and the museums of the Netherlands. In addition to doing research, the candidate will have the opportunity to teach within the LIAS.
Selection Criteria
PhD in a relevant field (South and Southeast Asian Studies, Religious Studies, Art History).
Prior experience in conducting historical research with primary literary and/or material sources.
Excellent command of English as well as command of a relevant Southeast Asian language. Reading knowledge of Sanskrit is preferred as well.
Interested in working collaboratively with a multidisciplinary team exploring primary sources and their broader socio-historical contexts.

Are you a Roman archaeologist passionate about marrying empirical detail to large-scale socioeconomic questions? The Roman Archaeology expertise group at the Radboud Institute for Culture and History is looking for a postdoctoral researcher to work closely with the group's Chair on developing a project on Roman failure. You will collect and analyse archaeological data to investigate what happened when investments did not pay off as expected.

In this position for two years you will contribute to a larger developing project that aims to take a case study-based approach to investigate the causes of and responses to failure in the Late Republican and Early Imperial Roman world. Failure is here defined as instances when risk caught up with plans. The Roman world was a high-risk environment, but this risk and its consequences were not equally distributed. A focus on failure favours socioeconomic processes of boom and bust at the expense of narratives of smooth growth and success. Overarching questions include whether failure was tied to a particular vision of the future; how failure intersects with precarity and privilege (who could fail; who could bounce back; who was marked as a failure); and whether and when failure triggered increased investment and fuelled growth.

As a postdoctoral researcher, you will collect data from published and unpublished excavation reports of Late Republican and Early Imperial Roman sites with evidence of investments that were abandoned, short-lived, or reoriented. These might include settlements, agricultural installations, infrastructure, or crafts and industries. Preference will be given to projects focusing on Roman Italy, but proposals on other areas of the Roman Empire will also be considered. You will build a database cross-referenced with a GIS platform in order to detect chronological, spatial, and organisational patterns, and carry out quantitative and/or qualitative analyses responding to some of the overarching questions as set out above.

You will be asked to propose and develop your own study, responding to the overarching questions.

Your main tasks will be to:

Compile a database and linked GIS platform.
Present the research results in at least one peer-reviewed article in an international scientific journal.
Organise an international conference on Roman failure in consultation with the Chair.
Work closely with the Chair in developing a framework for a larger funding bid.
Profile
You have completed a PhD in Archaeology, Anthropology, Classics, or Art History with solid knowledge of Roman archaeology.
You have an excellent research and publication record in relation to the career stage.
You have an excellent command of spoken and written English.

You are competent in GIS or willing to acquire this competency.
You have evidence of engagement with questions regarding Roman socioeconomics and the ability to think conceptually.
You are committed to team science within an international context.

Opleidingsniveau: Gepromoveerd
Functie type: Wetenschappelijk Personeel
Sluitingsdatum: 26 April 2023
Vacaturenummer: 11325
The Faculty of Humanities employs just under 1,000 employees, and approximately 8,000 students study there. The faculty consists of eight departments: Philosophy, Dutch Studies, Media Studies, Art and Cultural Studies, History, European Studies and Religious Studies, Amsterdam Centre for Ancient Studies and Archaeology, Modern Foreign Languages and Cultures, and Literature and Linguistics. Each department is composed of capacity groups, which consist of one or more professors and a number of employees who work in the relevant field.

The Department of Art and Cultural Studies has a vacancy for a full professorship in:

Architectural and Urban History 1,0 FTE (permanent position)

What will you do?

Context of the chair
The Professor of Architectural and Urban History is affiliated with the Amsterdam School of Historical Studies (ASH) and the Arts and Culture department (more specifically the Art History chair group). The basis for the chair is the historical approach of architecture from an art history perspective: this is of fundamental importance in order to ensure the necessary broad Humanities outlook for interdisciplinary research and teaching within and outside the UvA. In addition, the perspective will be broadened to include urban history, with special attention in the research dedicated to the experience of the urban environment; a more international interpretation that does not yet exist in the Netherlands. The new colleague to be appointed will therefore have architectural history experience with an added focus on contemporary urban history and urban design history, as well as the interplay between the built and natural environment, in which environmental history experience (the role of the historical city in its natural environment) is extremely desirable. The focus in this regard will be on a historical perspective that can be linked to modern-day problems of the urban and architectural living environment. This means that expertise in various approaches to the built environment, for example based on experience of the living environment (perception of the environment) will be expected.
The professor will be responsible, in particular, for teaching in the Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Art History, as well as in the Bachelor in Global Arts, Culture and Politics. The professor will play a significant role in both the teaching for the Master’s track Stadsgeschiedenis (Urban History) within the department of History, European Studies and Religious Studies and for various other degree programmes. In addition, the new professor is expected to undertake administrative tasks.

The chair will provide a strong starting point for the aforementioned collaborations within the University, but also with researchers and external institutions, such as Arcam, Het Nieuwe Instituut, the Cultural Heritage Agency, urban authorities and NGOs. The professor is expected to play a leading role in these types of collaborations.

Teaching
The professor will first be responsible for the Architectural History components within the Art History capacity group (capaciteitsgroep Kunstgeschiedenis). Architectural History is one of the four chair groups within the Art History capacity group, in addition to Medieval Art History (Middeleeuwse kunstgeschiedenis), Art History of the Early Modern Period (Kunstgeschiedenis van de nieuwere tijd), and Modern and Contemporary Art History (Moderne en hedendaagse kunstgeschiedenis). Approximately a quarter of the compulsory curriculum of the BA is therefore provided by the Architectural History chair group. In addition to these components, Architectural History also provides three successful BA specialisations, which can also be taken as electives (see also Minor): Ontwerpen voor de moderne stad (Designing for the Modern City); Dit is Amsterdam: identiteit en beeldvorming in kunst en architectuur (This is Amsterdam: identity and perception in art and architecture) and Reparatie en imitatie. Over het gebouwde erfgoed in het ‘eigentijdse’ Amsterdam. Over het gebouwde erfgoed in het 'eigentijdse' Amsterdam. (Repair and imitation. About the built heritage in ‘contemporary Amsterdam).

Secondly, the professor will make an important contribution to the minor Architectuur en Stedenbouw (minor in Architecture and Urban Planning). This is taken annually by approx. 20 students (mostly Human Geography, Urban and Regional Planning, and Geography students, in addition to students from other studies, including English, Economics, Communication Science, Philosophy, Sociology and Anthropology). The minor also provides a basis for the interdisciplinary Master’s track Stadsgeschiedenis (Urban History, department of History, European Studies and Religious Studies: approx. 5 minor students move on to this track annually. Finally, the professor will play an important role in the BA programme Global Arts, Culture and Politics, particularly the major in Sustainability).

Research
The professor will conduct research within the research school Amsterdam School of Historical Studies (ASH). It is important for the research school that the professor’s research ties in with the new methodological and theoretical developments within architectural history that also considers, in addition to the built environment, the urban perception of the environment from a social perspective and sensory experience. An additional expertise in the interplay between the built and natural environment is desirable. The new professor will take a central position within the Centre for Urban History within ASH. This centre has developed into an important pillar within ASH for interdisciplinary research into the history of the city from antiquity to the present day, with approximately 35 staff members from various disciplines. The professor is expected to assume a connecting and guiding role within this centre. In addition, the professor will be responsible for setting up broad interdisciplinary collaborations with researchers within the Faculty of Humanities (FGw) and the University of Amsterdam (UvA), for example with Urban Studies within the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences (FMG), leading to individual or group applications for research financing (ERC, NWO, NWA, etc.). In addition, an international orientation (with corresponding network) is desirable in order to guarantee the leading role of the chair in Amsterdam within a field that is increasingly globally oriented.
The newly appointed professor is further expected to have knowledge of contemporary, innovative and digital research methods, which provide insight into issues about the digital built environment, the digital city (also an important theme within the MA track Urban History) and the living environment, and to collaborate with researchers in Creative Amsterdam: An E-Humanities perspective, and the 4D-Research Lab.

It is expected that the professor to be appointed will be able to enthuse and mentor young researchers; that the professor will have experience in PhD supervision and be able to contribute to creating a safe and stimulating environment for PhD candidates. The professor will also bear responsibility for actively recruiting PhD candidates by means of submitting grant applications in the Netherlands and abroad.

Leadership
The professor to be appointed will preside over the Architectural History chair group with five staff members, which will include two lecturers, a professor by special appointment and two assistant professors, and will have to perform administrative duties at the level of the educational administration (programme director BA of MA), research organisation (e.g. research director of ASH or the national research school for art history) and/or at departmental level (capacity group chair Art History, departmental chair Arts and Culture). Expansion of the administrative capacity is needed within these various levels. Given the desire to create an environment for employees and students that is safe and inclusive, it is of vital importance that the professor to be appointed possesses organisational sensitivity and exercises leadership that is appropriate in this regard.

Your tasks and responsibilities:
teaching Architectural and Urban History, including supervising Bachelor’s and Master’s theses;
contributing to innovation and improvement of the curriculum in the field of Architectural and Urban History;
addressing research themes and projects within the chair group and research groups;
actively pursuing external funding for research, notably funding from research councils, on national as well as European level;
carrying out HR responsibilities within the Architectural History chair group;
carrying out administrative and management tasks within the Department and Faculty.

What expertise do we require of you?

Successful candidates for the position are expected to meet the following requirements.
You:
hold a PhD in Architectural History or a related academic field;
have an excellent international academic reputation and publication profile, which match the research themes of ASH;
have an affinity with inclusive, polyphonous historical scholarship and digital methods;
are an experienced and engaged teacher at all levels of academic training;
have expertise in developing and renewing teaching programmes at Bachelor’s and Master’s levels;
can show a track record of applying for/acquiring external research funding;

The Faculty of Humanities at Leiden University invites applications for a fulltime PhD position in Buddhist Studies. The PhD candidate will carry out research in the framework of the European Research Council (ERC) funded project ""Locating Literature, Lived Religion, and Lives in the Himalayas: The Van Manen Collection"" led by dr. Berthe Jansen. This project offers a study of an important collection of Himalayan texts and artifacts collected between 1920 and 1940 in Kalimpong and Tibet. It aims to provide a view of the Van Manen collection through a study of its rare manuscripts, the material objects, undocumented marginal writings, and the unique Tibetan language autobiographies by ordinary Himalayan people commissioned by Van Manen.

The project's goal is the examination of the van Manen Collection as a whole using historical, ethnographic and philological methods, and by employing Digital Humanities methods through which the origins of the texts and artifacts can be traced, mapped, and be made available, linking them to other editions in online databases as well as to local Tibetan archives. The main aim is to get an understanding of the proliferation, usage, and presence of religious and ritual literature and artifacts in the greater Darjeeling area in the first half of the 20th century and, by extension, their religious milieus.
The PhD candidate will work mainly with the rare and unusual Tibetan language manuscripts in the collection. S/he will make an inventory of the manuscripts that are either rare or unique and try to trace the geographical and textual origins of these manuscripts with the help of the PI. This will be done through 1) an examination of the ephemera that discuss the methods Van Manen’s assistants used to collect manuscripts 2) fieldwork: interviewing households that still own similar manuscripts in the greater Kalimpong area to retrieve information on the context of these ritual texts, and 3) locating similar manuscripts in existing databases such as that of the BDRC. Under the guidance of the PI, the PhD candidate will select particularly important Tibetan language texts, analyze, contextualize, and (as appropriate) translate them.

The PhD candidate will be based in Leiden where s/he will join a research team that will consist of four members: one PhD candidate, two post-doctoral researchers, and the project leader. S/he will participate in regular teammeetings and present his/her research findings at scholarly venues, as well as in field trips to India.
Requirements
An MA degree in Buddhist Studies, Tibetan Studies, Religious Studies or comparable. Candidates near completion of the degree will be considered
Excellent command of written Tibetan, both classical and modern
Fluency in spoken and written English
Broad knowledge of Tibetan religious and cultural history
Knowledge of (or willingness to learn) spoken Tibetan, Nepalese or Lepcha will be considered an asset
Some experience in working with Tibetan religious texts
Demonstrable interest in manuscript culture and literary production in culturally Tibetan regions
Willingness to work in an international research environment
Willingness to spend a limited amount of time teaching in the 2nd and 3rd year of the 4-year PhD trajectory
Willingness to help organize the yearly workshops
Ability to work independently and as part of and in support of a larger team

 Apply Now
Develop data-enabled system and control co-design algorithms, synergizing control theory with novel machine learning techniques, to reinforce the performance of future-engineered systems.
Job description
In the last decades, the classical control theory has proven its effectiveness in terms of analysis and control (design) methodologies. Control theory has been a key enabler in the realization of complex systems. However, increasing system complexity leads to an increasingly indirect relationship between linear to practically meaningful performance. Moreover, the intricate requirements for system performance complicate controller design through the sole use of the classical control theory. Synergizing established fundamental control with promising data-enabled machine-learning techniques could effectively solve these present-day design challenges.

You will develop algorithms to effectuate efficient data-enabled systems and control co-design approaches. Therefore, you will tightly synergize the established control theory with novel data-enabled techniques from the fields of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). This allows for the design and efficient calibration of the system and controller in unison.

The algorithms that you develop will be applied to wind turbines, both in simulation and experimentally on lab-scale wind tunnel set-ups. The application area is highly relevant, as wind turbines see a rapid increase in system complexity. Next-generation large-scale wind turbines are becoming ever larger with increasing performance demands to satisfy the net-zero emission targets. This size increase leads to greater complexity through dynamic interactions. The exponential growth of data from wind turbines motivates the development and application of novel co-design techniques to achieve next-level performance, ultimately lowering the costs of renewable energy.

You will join our data-driven control research group, which is part of the department of Delft Center for Systems and Control (DCSC) of the faculty of Mechanical, Maritime, and Materials Engineering (3mE). At the DCSC, our mission is to conduct fundamental research in systems dynamics and control, involving dynamic modeling, advanced control theory, and optimization. Our group has a strong history in control for wind energy, with a strong impact through practical applicability.

Techniques that are actively used in our group are classical control theory (i.e., observer/control design, frequency domain analysis, loop-shaping), machine learning (including Gaussian processes and neural networks), (first principles) system modeling, adaptive and learning control, system identification, and multivariable control.
Requirements
This position is perfect for you if you possess profound knowledge of system modeling, system analysis, and (classical) control engineering, and when you have experience with or special interest in ML/AI techniques.

You will have ample space to display your auto-didactic skills and independently conduct ground-breaking research. You have a strong research-oriented attitude, good communication skills, and the ability to transfer knowledge and effectively present your challenges and results. Also, you are willing to grow as a positive (graduate) student supervisor. Working from elsewhere is permitted, however, there is a requirement for being present at least four days per week at the TU Delft faculty.

You also have:

An MSc in systems and control (control engineering), mechatronics, mechanical engineering, aeroelastics, machine learning, or a related field.
Excellent programming skills in MATLAB/Simulink.
Excellent command of the English language.

Make sure to apply when this position does spark excitement in you. If you do not tick all the boxes but are in possession of a profound understanding of control engineering, we’d definitely like to get to know you!

Doing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and a final thesis. For more details please check the Graduate Schools Admission Requirements.
Conditions of employment
Doctoral candidates will be offered a 4-year period of employment in principle, but in the form of 2 employment contracts. An initial 1,5 year contract with an official go/no go progress assessment within 15 months. Followed by an additional contract for the remaining 2,5 years assuming everything goes well and performance requirements are met.

Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities, increasing from € 2541 per month in the first year to € 3247 in the fourth year. As a PhD candidate you will be enrolled in the TU Delft Graduate School. The TU Delft Graduate School provides an inspiring research environment with an excellent team of supervisors, academic staff and a mentor.

Professor of Contemporary Performing Arts,"University of Groningen
Since its foundation in 1614, the University of Groningen has established an international reputation as a dynamic and innovative university offering high quality teaching and research. Its 37,000 students are encouraged to develop their individual talents through challenging study and career paths. The University of Groningen is an international centre of knowledge: it belongs to the best research universities in Europe, and is allied with prestigious partner universities and networks worldwide. For additional information, see this link: https://www.rug.nl/about-ug/work-with-us/new-staff/. The University of Groningen has a strong commitment to the principles and practices of diversity and inclusion throughout the University community and welcomes candidates who enhance that diversity.

Faculty of Arts
The Faculty of Arts is building on a longstanding tradition of four centuries. Its mission is to be an ambitious top-ranking faculty in terms of both education and high-quality research, with a strong international orientation, firmly rooted in the North of the Netherlands. The faculty creates and shares knowledge through outstanding education and high-quality research, benefitting society.

Arts, Culture and Media
The ACM program is unique in the Netherlands with its doubly interdisciplinary structure: it combines a variety of theoretical and methodological perspectives with a broad range of art disciplines where students choose two art forms in their BA studies from music, theatre, film, literature or the visual arts. This rich interdisciplinary and inter-art setting calls for a scholar with openness to interdisciplinarity. Some of the overarching questions studied by the ACM staff are: How do we define the arts and what are their functions? Which roles do the arts play in the lives of individuals, for specific social groups and within society as a whole? How do related media impact the experiences and evaluation of the arts, and how do contemporary and newly emerging art forms relate to each other and the evolution and history of the arts? How have developments such as intermedial art, participatory art, digital art, performance art, sound art, or new media art transformed the arts in recent years? How do these new and emerging forms of arts deal with questions of climate disaster, post-colonialism, gender inequality? Related to this broad range of questions the new chair should also show commitment to thinking about historical changes in discussions about the arts and share a strong commitment to studying how the arts contribute to societal values and individual worldviews.

The Faculty of Arts in the University of Groningen invites applications for the position of Full Professor of Contemporary Performing Arts (Theatre/Music/Dance). This is a full-time and permanent post.

The successful candidate has an excellent, proven track record in the field of Contemporary Performing Arts, both in research and teaching, and has excellent leadership and mentorship qualities. The new professor comes with a rich and varied experience of working in multidisciplinary teams and is able to work in different fields. The chair holder is expected to lead a dynamic team of researchers with varied research interests and disciplinary backgrounds, and to promote and serve the long-term interests of the team and its members within the Faculty of Arts and beyond.

Research
The research task of the professor covers 40% of the appointment. Research in the field of Arts, Culture and Media (ACM) is housed in the Groningen Research Institute for the Study of Culture (ICOG) and, within this, in the Research Center for Arts in Society with theme groups such as ‘Music, Sound and Culture,’ ‘Film and Contemporary Audiovisual Media,’ and ‘Arts, Culture and Cognition.’ Furthermore, members of the Department of Arts, Culture and Media participate in various national research schools, such as the Research School for Media Studies (RMeS) or the Netherlands Institute of Cultural Analysis (NICA). The new chair will actively contribute to at least one of them. The new professor is expected to secure funding for research projects through research proposals in cooperation with academic or non-academic institutions within and outside the Netherlands. The candidate should therefore have experience in setting up national and international research programmes and obtaining funding. An extensive national and international network is essential.
The new chair will also actively seek PhDs students and explore new ways for joint or double degrees.

Teaching
Teaching covers 60% of the appointment (minus compensated management tasks), and the candidate is expected to teach and lead development of courses at all levels in the department. The ACM department provides education at the Bachelor level in the form of the international BA Arts, Culture and Media, the four minors and pre-master programmes, four MA tracks and two Research Master tracks. The new chair will be teaching in the BA program and in one or more of the four MA tracks in ‘Arts & Culture’: ‘Music, Theatre and Performance Studies’, ‘Arts, Cognition and Criticism’, ‘Arts, Policy and Cultural Entrepreneurship’, and ‘Film and Contemporary Audiovisual Media’, as well as the Research MA ‘Arts & Culture’ with its two tracks ‘Arts, Media and Literary Studies’ and ‘Cultural Leadership.’ Which courses the candidate will be teaching will depend on the profile of the candidate and needs of the program.

Management
The new professor leads the chair group Contemporary Performing Arts (Theatre/Music/Dance) and performs service and administrative tasks within and outside the Faculty of Arts. The new chair holder will play an active role in promoting the regional, national and international prestige of the chair group by initiating and contributing to existing societal and networking activities and will represent the chair group through their contacts with academic institutions and societal partners in the Netherlands and abroad.
