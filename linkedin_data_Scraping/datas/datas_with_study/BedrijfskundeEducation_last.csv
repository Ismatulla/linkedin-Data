PhD in Network Statistics and Machine Learning,"PhD in Network Statistics and Machine Learning
Faculteit/Dienst: Faculteit Economie & Bedrijfskunde
Opleidingsniveau: Master
Functie type: Wetenschappelijk Personeel
Sluitingsdatum: 1 May 2023
Vacaturenummer: 11265
Are you interested in studying networks and using methodology at the cross-section of business analytics, econometrics and computer science? The Business Analytics section at the University of Amsterdam Business School invites applications for a PhD position in Network Statistics and Machine Learning. We are looking for candidates with the ambition to work and succeed at the highest international academic level.

The main topic of research is network analysis and modelling using statistical and machine learning tools. Network data are ubiquitous in finance, social media, the economy, and business. Social networks play an increasingly important role in society. For example, the Reddit community WallStreetBets hyped the stock of GameStop (GME), causing a short squeeze and extremely volatile stock prices in early 2021. Similarly, statements made on social networks such as Twitter have been shown to impact public and voter opinions. Exemplifying how social networks directly affect the economy, this project focusses on studying network data with a specific interest in modelling and understanding how networks change over time. Change detection in an online fashion is a challenging task in networks of large size, a common property of social networks.

In this research, the candidate will first investigate and develop interpretable network analysis approaches using statistical models and test them on real-life data. Then geometric deep learning approaches for the tasks like node classification, link prediction and graph classification will be developed with change detection ability. In the final phase of the project, the candidate should bring together two families of methods and design an optimized algorithm that is both interpretable and yields a high performance in network change detection.

The PhD student will work in close collaboration with the supervisory team and other faculty on the tasks.
The supervisory team will consist of dr. Inez Zwetsloot (ABS), dr. Simon Trimborn (ASE) and dr. Stevan Rudinac (ABS).

What are you going to do?

Develop novel interpretable statistical models for network analysis;
develop novel deep-learning approaches for node classification, link prediction, and community detection in network data;
create open data and software tools for the envisioned network analysis tasks;
present research findings at international conferences;
write up findings for publication in international journals;
pursue and complete a PhD thesis within the appointed duration of four years;
attend classes and seminars (including those offered at other universities) to develop thinking and research skills further;
participate in and contribute to departmental research functions (PhD Day, research seminars, and research meetings);
assist in knowledge dissemination activities;
participate in teaching-related activities (to a limited degree), including undergraduate tutorials and the supervision of MSc and/or BSc thesis projects.

What do we require?

Formal requirements:
Masters’ degree in Statistics, Econometrics, Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Mathematics, or a related field (expected to finish by September 2023)

Task-related requirements:
Excellent communication skills in English, both oral and written, ideally with experience writing for a scientific audience;

The challenge
The Nyenrode Career & Personal Development (CPD) team plays an important role in the development and growth of our students, working closely with all students of the full- and part-time MBA, MSc in Management and BSc in Business Administration programs on an individual basis and in a variety of mandatory CPD courses. In alignment with Nyenrode’s personal approach, we strive to focus on students’ personal development questions on a more individual basis. Together with students, we work on their personal and career development challenges, to help them understand their strengths and define and articulate their ambitions. We guide students in their job search and in outlining their further career steps after graduation. The department also provides support, expertise, and guidance to Nyenrode alumni.

As Coordinator, Career & Personal Development, you enjoy interaction with current and former students and provide career advice and support, such as providing feedback on CVs and cover letters. Maintenance and continuous improvement of CPD resources and tools, for instance the LinkedIn groups and Nyenrode career platform that are key to our students’ development, will be a key responsibility. Working together with the CPD advisors, you support events such as student-alumni networking sessions and the annual Nyenrode Career Event, some of which may take place on evenings and/or weekends. With the CPD advisors, you are a first point of contact for organizations wishing to reach out to students, and you support the communication between CPD and the corporate community and co-coordinate job postings and content for other publications of CPD materials. The CPD team works with students across different programs, and a role of the Coordinator is to remain in regular contact with diverse groups of colleagues across the university.

Project descriptions
This PhD position deals with digitalization and focuses on technological innovation implementation, digital twins, and standardization. Much research has been conducted about the technical sides of digitalization. However, in the practice, even the technical solutions are ready and mature, these pilot projects are still yet to receive a large-scale implementation due to legal and organizational considerations. Also, the interoperability of various systems remains a key challenge. This project is to identify the bottlenecks and solutions, and in sequence collaborate with the corresponding stakeholders to jointly establish a technical and governance framework for the selected use cases.

The training and supervision plan will be made based on the expectation from the PhD project, as well as the mutual agreement with the supervisors and the graduate school. During the first year, the PhD candidate will already start work on the PhD project. At the same time, the candidate will receive the training in theory and methods by taking several PhD-level courses. For the remaining three years, 70% of the position’s time will be dedicated to the completion of your PhD education and research, and 30% to the acquisition of academic skills through teaching courses and supervising master/bachelor theses within the department. To be trained as an independent scholar, the selected candidate is also expected to participate in grant writing and contribute to the research group accordingly. There is also a good travel budget for attending summer schools, working visits and conferences.

The appointed PhD candidate will be an employee of Tilburg University. The starting gross salary is
€ 2,541 per month (for a full-time appointment) in the first year, up to € 3,247 in the final year. There is a holiday allowance (8% in May), and end-of-year bonus (8.3% in December).

Business IT Consultant voor de ondersteunende diensten,"Ben jij die business IT consultant die gek is op werk, maar net zo gek op je privéleven?

Dan gaan we graag met jou in gesprek om te kijken of we samen de Hogeschool Utrecht naar het next level kunnen brengen.

Kort door de bocht? Jij vertaalt informatiebehoeften naar IT-oplossingen. En wat minder kort door de bocht? Aan de hand van jouw business- en informatieanalyse bij de opstart en tijdens projecten, schrijf je business cases en doe je projectvoorstellen. Jouw analyses raken zowel het tactisch als strategisch niveau: we zijn nu bijvoorbeeld aan het nadenken over de vervanging van een kennissysteem. Daar is een informatiebehoefte, er moet worden bepaald waar we nu staan en waar we op termijn willen staan. Jij weet vanuit de (functionele) mogelijkheden van een geïntegreerd applicatielandschap, keuzes te maken voor oplossingsrichtingen. Samen met de klant, een instituut of dienst, kijk je welke projecten op welk moment gestart moeten gaan worden. Daarvoor stel jij een roadmap op. Voor een project als onboarding wordt bijvoorbeeld gekeken naar wat onboarding bij de HU inhoudt en op welke manier dat vanuit IT wordt ondersteund: welke pakketten zijn er beschikbaar en welke keuzes moet je maken. Samen met de klant maak je afwegingen en kom je tot oplossingen, waarna jij een juist advies kan bieden. Andere elementen in jouw nieuwe baan zijn het inrichten van de governance en het inrichten van technisch en functioneel beheer en soms pak jij de coördinatie bij de uitvoering van projecten.

Wat extra aansprekend is aan deze functie? Jij kunt jij jouw ervaring in de begeleiding bij aanbestedingen inzetten: vanuit jouw rol schrijf je mee aan het programma van eisen, dat in samenwerking met de afdeling Inkoop en de klant wordt opgesteld.

Wat bieden we jou?

The Department of Business Administration at the Nijmegen School of Management is offering a PhD position on a contract for 4-5 years, starting at the candidate's earliest convenience.

You will investigate entrepreneurship from a dynamic perspective, with a possible focus on start-ups in the platform economy. Even though the entrepreneurship literature strongly calls for process-oriented research, insights over time into entrepreneurial processes are still less frequent - partly due to a lack of suitable data sets. To address this gap and provide novel insights into entrepreneurial processes, you will be given access to the Perfect Timing (PT) Database and a panel dataset on platform entrepreneurs. In addition, you are also invited to collect your own dataset, e.g. through web-scraping or surveys. Possible analyses of the respective data include, but are not limited to, advanced regression techniques, survival analyses, sequence analyses, or Heckman models.

You will be supervised by Prof. Andrea M. Herrmann in collaboration with colleagues providing expert knowledge to the project, most notably Associate Prof. Anna Nadolska and Associate Prof. Matthias Weiss.

Your teaching load will be up to 10% of your working time. All teaching duties will be organised in consultation with you and in a way that will facilitate your thesis progress.
Profile
You have an MSc degree in one or more of the following disciplines: business and management studies, political economy, sociology, economics, innovation studies, or a related discipline.
You have a proven scientific interest in entrepreneurship research.
You have completed at least one year of your higher education at a university providing thorough training in Western research standards (this is typically the case for universities located in Europe or North America).
You have knowledge of and an interest in institutional theories, and you have strong analytical skills and a background in quantitative methods.
You have a proven ability to work with statistical software, such as R, Stata and SPSS.
You have high proficiency in English and, ideally, also in Dutch. Fluency in German would be an additional advantage.
You have excellent scientific writing skills, as evidenced by your Master's thesis.
You have strong skills in project management, flexibility and a proactive behaviour, making you a team player and pleasant collaboration partner.

PhD on Integrated Front-End for High Sensitivity Radio Receivers,"Job description
This PhD project will be conducted in close collaboration with ASTRON, the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (www.astron.nl). ASTRON develops and operates highly sensitive radio telescopes to capture and process radio signals that originate from space. These signals can, for example, originate from various celestial objects that emit radiation in the radio frequency (RF) spectrum.
As most of these signals are extremely weak, high sensitivity radio receivers are required, i.e. their equivalent noise temperature must be very low. Moreover, as the RF spectrum is getting increasingly crowded, these receivers must also be able to handle large interference signals. This can be partly accomplished by the use of filters that block parts of the spectrum with (known) interference sources. However, typical complex filters increase the equivalent noise temperature of the receiver significantly and not all interferes can be suppressed. Therefore, the receiver must be designed to also exhibit a large dynamic range in order to avoid non-linear effects that disturb the quality of the signals of interest.
The goal of this PhD research is to develop innovative concepts for the design of fully integrated receiver front-ends, from antenna to ADC, that exhibit high sensitivity. Through the collaboration with ASTRON and the rest of the MID4automotive consortium (see below), a variety of promising integration technology platforms are available for this.
Embedding of the PhD project in the MID4automotive project
The PhD project is funded through the European project MID4automotive with partner from the Netherlands and Germany. This project will address the integration challenges of the application domains automotive radar and connectivity by the use of 3D-MID technology. 3D-MID is a packaging and integration technology that allows for three-dimensional arrangements of components and great flexibility in the shape of the final module. The consortium includes world-leading European companies, research institutes and universities among which are the end users, technology providers, component and (sub-)system manufacturers as well as system test specialists. Together, they are targeting international markets worth billions of euros and where this project is a key enabling collaboration effort to achieve their business goals.
The PhD project is part of the connectivity work package of MID4automotive. While the research is strongly focussed on ASTRON’s radio astronomy use case, which is not the primary scope of MID4automotive, the targeted innovations are also in line with the wireless connectivity market, where especially NXP has indicated an interest.

Job requirements
Applicants should have, or expect to receive, a Master of Science degree or equivalent in a relevant electrical engineering or applied physics discipline.
The selection is based on the candidates’ application documents in combination with their performance during the interviews and possible assignments.
Besides good subject knowledge, emphasis will be placed on creative thinking, motivation, ability to work in a team, initiative to work independently and personal suitability for research training.
An educational background in the areas of antennas, filters, and other microwave engineering components, and/or wireless signal processing is required. Practical experience is considered beneficial.
Proficiency in using scientific and engineering software packages such as Matlab, ADS, CST etc. are advantageous.
Fluency in spoken and written English is essential.
Conditions of employment
A meaningful job in a dynamic and ambitious university, in an interdisciplinary setting and within an international network. You will work on a beautiful, green campus within walking distance of the central train station. In addition, we offer you:
Full-time employment for four years, with an intermediate evaluation (go/no-go) after nine months. You will spend 10% of your employment on teaching tasks.
Salary and benefits (such as a pension scheme, paid pregnancy and maternity leave, partially paid parental leave) in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities.
A year-end bonus of 8.3% and annual vacation pay of 8%.
High-quality training programs and other support to grow into a self-aware, autonomous scientific researcher. At TU/e we challenge you to take charge of your own learning process.
An excellent technical infrastructure, on-campus children's day care and sports facilities.
An allowance for commuting, working from home and internet costs.
A Staff Immigration Team and a tax compensation scheme (the 30% facility) for international candidates.

Beschrijving:
Wij zijn op zoek naar een aantal docenten voor de opleiding Bedrijfskunde

Breed inzetbare docenten voor de opleiding Bedrijfskunde 0,6 – 1,0 FTE

Wie zijn wij?
Bij de opleiding Bedrijfskunde geven wij met ongeveer 90 collega’s les aan 1600 studenten op de HvA campus aan de Wibautstraat en in het Corry Tendeloohuis in Amsterdam Zuid-Oost. Onze studenten zijn na HAVO/VWO of MBO opleiding (soms na 1 of meer tussenjaren) begonnen aan hun HBO opleiding.

Ons onderwijsprogramma heeft de volgende opbouw: in jaar 1 en 2 geven we les in verschillende vakken. Drie daarvan komen terug in alle jaren van de opleiding: Operations Management, Informatie Management en Organisatiekunde. In het tweede jaar bieden we de vakken Recht en Ethiek aan. Ook geven we veel projectonderwijs en ontwikkelen studenten tijdens trainingen verschillende vaardigheden. In jaar 3 kiezen studenten een stage en een minor. En in jaar 4 werken zij aan opdrachten voor externe opdrachtgevers, o.a. in de vorm van een afstudeeropdracht.

Wij werken in kleine onderwijsteams (4 tot 8 medewerkers). De leden van zo’n team zijn samen verantwoordelijk voor de voorbereiding, uitvoering en verbetering van het onderwijs.
Onze kijk op onderwijs:
Onze studenten leren vooral door te doen en te ervaren. Daarom werken we zo veel mogelijk met echte opdrachten en opdrachtgevers. We willen de studenten zelf de regie geven over hun leerproces. Dat doen we bijvoorbeeld door in jaar 2 een aantal keuzevakken aan te bieden. In alle jaren gaan studenten zelf op zoek naar externe opdrachtgevers waar ze bedrijfskundige opdrachten voor uitvoeren. Op deze manier worden onze studenten de slimme, wendbare doeners waar organisaties behoefte aan hebben.
We zijn vanwege groei en het vertrek van een aantal collega’s per 1 augustus op zoek naar breed inzetbare docent(en), vooral voor de volgende rollen en vakken:
Coach van studenten in jaar 1 en 2;
docent in jaar 1 en 2, met name voor projectonderwijs en de vakgebieden operations, informatiemanagement en strategisch management;
zakelijk schrijven;
afstudeerbegeleiding.

We werken het liefst met breed inzetbare docenten, dat wil zeggen dat je een aantal van deze rollen kunt combineren.
Wie zoeken we
Je hebt een relevante academische opleiding en werkervaring, die maken dat je de verbinding tussen onderwijs en praktijk gemakkelijk maakt. Je werkt als docent veel samen met collega’s, daarom vinden we het belangrijk dat je een teamspeler bent die graag initiatief en verantwoordelijkheid neemt. Je draagt actief bij aan de teams waar je deel van uitmaakt, bijvoorbeeld door onderwijs te ontwikkelen en toetsen te maken. Je vindt het leuk om met studenten te werken en je kunt je goed in hen verplaatsen. Je stimuleert de studenten om te leren, om samen te werken aan echte bedrijfsopdrachten en om nieuwsgierig en onderzoekend te zijn. Ervaring met onderwijs is welkom, maar zeker geen must. De HvA biedt je de mogelijkheid om je didactische bevoegdheid te behalen, en je bent ook bereid deze te behalen.
Verder:
Beschik je over uitstekende digitale vaardigheden en je leert snel omgaan met nieuwe (software) systemen;
ben je minimaal drie dagen in de week beschikbaar, waaronder in ieder geval de vrijdag.

Wat bieden we?
Een mooie, uitdagende baan met veel ruimte om je eigen invulling te geven aan je werk;
een fijn, divers en gemotiveerd team van docenten;
een dienstverband voor in eerste instantie 1 jaar (met uitzicht op verlenging) in de functie van docent/onderzoeker 2 met een brutosalaris van minimaal € 3.380,- en maximaal € 5.330,- bij een fulltime dienstverband (schaal 11, cao hbo). Verlenging van het dienstverband is afhankelijk van gebleken geschiktheid, formatieruimte en de toestroom van nieuwe studenten;
een uitgebreid pakket secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden, waaronder een ruime verlofregeling, vakantieregeling, een 13e maand, uitstekende studie- en ontwikkelingsmogelijkheden, en aandacht voor vitaliteit (gratis sporten etc).

You're also
A detailed doer – You have a track record of getting things done. You're organized and responsive. You take ownership of every idea you touch and execute it to a fine level of detail, setting targets, engaging others, and doing whatever it takes to get the job done. You can multi-task dozens of such projects at once and never lose sight of the details. Likely, you have some experience in a start-up or other rapid-growth company.
A creative problem-solver – Growing any business from scratch comes with massive and constant challenges. On top of that, NewGlobe works in often fragile, sometimes volatile low-resource communities and with complex government systems. You need to be flexible and ready to get everything done effectively, quickly, and affordably with the materials at hand.
A relentless advocate –The children we serve and teachers we empower never leave your mind. You know them, get them, have shared a meal with them (or would be happy to in the future). You would never shrink back from shaking a parent's hand or picking up a crying child, no matter what the person was wearing or looked like. Every decision you make considers their benefit, experience,

and value.
A malleable learner –You believe you can always do better. You welcome constructive criticism and provide it freely to others. You know you only get better tomorrow when others point out where you've missed things or failed today.
A data-driven decision-maker – When making decisions, you don't rely on your intuition alone. You collect data, you analyze it and make decisions with clear justifications.
A curious investigator – You ask why a lot. You don't just take what you see and accept it. You wonder why it is that way, and are aware that the world we see is created by human choices and actions – and it could be different. You wonder, and see the world as wonderful even when you want to change a part of it that is unjust.
