Are you an innovative, experienced and inspiring scholar in the field of the history of art and architecture between 500-1500? Do your research and teaching explore cross-cultural connections and expand or complicate the geographical and cultural boundaries of the 'medieval'? As a full professor at Radboud University, you will join and lead a diverse group of dedicated scholars, shape the field of art and architectural history, and flourish in a friendly and vibrant academic community.

The History of Art section at Radboud University is looking for a Full Professor of History of Art and Architecture between 500-1500 CE (1,0 FTE). The position builds on the section's existing strengths, which includes visual and material culture of Europe after 1500 CE, architecture, and global modern and contemporary art.
You are an art historian whose research explores cross-cultural connections and links historical research to contemporary issues and practices, such as cultural heritage. Our section is especially interested in scholars whose research and teaching expand or complicate the geographical and cultural boundaries of the 'medieval', who incorporate new methodologies, and whose interests include Islamic Art and Architecture, materiality and craft (including modern material-technical research), or the social uses and sensory experiences of works of art.

As a Professor of History of Art and Architecture at Radboud University, you will build on your robust and innovative research agenda, track record of outstanding scholarly publications, and other academic achievements on an international level.

You will represent the Art History section within the university and beyond, serve as its head in a rotating fashion with one other full professor, and work in close connection with its staff members and with the Department as a whole. You will be joining a university with expertise in Mediterranean Studies (both in the Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of Philosophy, Theology and Religious Studies). You will be expected to serve as a standard bearer for student recruitment, and take on a crucial role in the promotion and visibility of medieval visual and material cultures, both nationally and internationally.

Assistant Professor (career track) in Transdisciplinary Science & Technology Studies,"The position

At the Athena Institute of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam we invite applications for a full-time permanent appointment as assistant professor in Transdisciplinary Science & Technology Studies, specializing in material approaches for transformation.


LOCATION: Amsterdam

FTE: 1

Job description
Within STS there is increasing attention for transdisciplinary scholarship that explores new forms of knowledge production, expression, and travel in relation to technoscience. This development happens under several related headings, such as STS Making & Doing, Situated Intervention, Material Participation and Experimental Collaborations. These approaches share that scholars adopt active roles in the co-shaping of knowledge practices and technologies. Scholarship in this domain requires entwining normative commitments with experimental, co-constructive theory-method packages that extend beyond discursive interventions.


Your duties

In this position you need to empirically study and experimentally shape practices of technology development and/or knowledge production. Your research approach should primarily be experimental and collaborative, with the aim of addressing societal challenges regarding participation in science and technology, broadly defined. Your profile should display specific attention to questions of equity. Research at the Athena Institute includes approaches such as STS Making & Doing; Interactive Learning and Action; Reflexive monitoring in action (RMA); and Situated Intervention, that share that issue-articulation and the exploration of solutions are developed in collaboration with a wide range of actors/stakeholders. Although there are no specific requirements regarding topical areas of specialization, candidates need to relate their work to the five research themes of the Athena Institute; Emerging science and technology; (Global) health and well-being; Nature, agriculture and environment; Competency development in inter- and transdisciplinary research; and History of knowledge. The successful candidate is expected to collaborate with different colleagues in projects across these research themes.
Requirements
A completed PhD in science, technology & society studies, participatory design, innovation studies, or a related (inter)discipline; an additional background in the sciences is a plus;
Proven experience with experimental methods for the transdisciplinary study of public issues/challenges;
Experience with participatory research methods that co-shape technologies and knowledge practices to address societal challenges in an equitable way;
Proven ability to be a strong collaborator within interdisciplinary teams (listening, flexible, adaptive, pro-active);
Strong and relevant publication track-record, commensurate with the candidate’s career stage and complementing and extending the Athena Institute’s research portfolio;
Experience with applying for research grants and externally funded projects and ability to meet deadlines and produce deliverables;
Excellent teaching skills and the ability to inspire students (demonstrated through a.o. positive student evaluations);
A teaching qualification (in Dutch BKO);
An (inter)national network relevant to the position;
Good command of Dutch (preferred) and excellent command of English.
Faculty criteria for appointment at the level of assistant professor are available upon request but minimally include having completed a PhD and having approximately 10 international peer reviewed publications.


Given the extensive collaboration with both international as well as Dutch partners, a good command of Dutch language is required for the position. Since this appointment is intended to result in a tenured position, strong candidates who can convincingly argue that they will be able to master a good working level of Dutch in a relatively short period of time (e.g. through having lived/worked/studied in the Netherlands or having mastered a similar foreign language before) are welcome to apply.
What are we offering?
A challenging career track position from Assistant Professor 2 to Assistant Professor 1 in a socially involved organization. On full-time basis the remuneration amounts to a minimum gross monthly salary of €3,974 (scale 11) and a maximum €5,439 (scale 11), depending on your education and experience. The job profile: Assistant Professor 2 is based on the university job ranking system and is vacant for at least 0.8 FTE.


We offer 2 types of contracts. For candidates already living in the Netherlands, we offer a permanent position after 18 months, after a successful evaluation in your 15th month. After a successful evaluation, a path will be outlined for future academic development.

To candidates that will relocate from abroad we offer a second option next to the previous one. This will be a first (temporary) contract for the duration of 6 years. After 2 and 4 years the performance will be evaluated in terms of teaching, publication record, and acquisition of project funding (in addition to the annual assessment with your supervisor). After a successful evaluation permanent employment will be granted after 6 years and a path will be outlined for future academic development.


Additionally, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam offers excellent fringe benefits and various schemes and regulations to promote a good work/life balance, such as:
a maximum of 41 days of annual leave based on full-time employment,
8% holiday allowance and
8.3% end-of-year bonus,
solid pension scheme (ABP),
possibility to save holiday hours, for sabbatical leave,
child daycare facilities available on campus

You will build and maintain external relationships that may help forward research on responsible innovation and entrepreneurship. This requires a clear understanding of what drives academic researchers, as well as a certain sensitivity to the needs of professionals in the field who stimulate or develop innovations. Your ambition is to act as a linking pin between academic research and practice. An important responsibility will be to support a newly established PhD project on the Responsible Innovation Scan, setting up the network contacts required for developing and validating this Scan, as well as support the data collection and analysis in this project. As part of the Responsible Innovation Scan team, you will develop the infrastructure needed to continue data collection for the scan after this project has been concluded, thus providing a long-lasting asset for the hotspot.

Furthermore, you will be expected to engage the hotspot researchers in projects on responsible innovation and explore possibilities for additional research projects and publications based on data from the Responsible Innovation Scan. You will therefore identify relevant calls for research on responsible innovation and entrepreneurship, and match them to hotspot researchers in cooperation with grant advisors from the interdisciplinary Institute for Management Research (IMR). In addition, you will coordinate an annual event that links academic research to practice. Finally, you will establish a hotspot research council consisting of representatives from non-academic research partners. You will have a small teaching load of up to 10 percent of your working time.

Under the motto 'Creating Knowledge for Society', IMR focuses on academic research into the development, design and effectiveness of the public and private structures that regulate, govern or manage human interactions.

The Department of Business Administration is responsible for the BSc programmes in Business Administration (including a full track offered in English, and a track in International Business Administration) as well as eight specialisations within the MSc programme in Business Administration (all in English). The Department's interdisciplinary research programme is called Responsible Organisation and addresses the multiple values underlying responsibility, the conditions required to realise those values, and the interventions geared to the transition of organisations towards responsible organisations. The Department of Business Administration co-creates knowledge with multiple stakeholders in the wider community to ensure the impact of its academic work.

The Hotspot Responsible Innovation & Entrepreneurship is an interdisciplinary research group that makes its knowledge of responsible innovation available to entrepreneurs, innovative firms and policy makers. The researchers share a business ecosystem perspective, while having varied disciplinary backgrounds. This provides these researchers with a better and more holistic understanding of innovation and entrepreneurship in the 21st century. Members of this hotspot focus on the responsibility aspects of innovation and entrepreneurship such as adoption of green innovations, market creation for sustainable innovations, open innovation, and green product development. They have published in high-impact journals such as Journal of Marketing, Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, Journal of Product Innovation Management, Academy of Management Journal, Research Policy, Journal of Economic Geography, and Regional Studies.

As an academic relationship builder / postdoctoral researcher, you will be embedded in the hotspot 'Responsible Innovation and Entrepreneurship'. You will work closely together with the coordinators of this research hotspot (Dr Driessen and Prof. Hillebrand) and will be part of the Responsible Innovation Scan project team, consisting of a doctoral candidate and a doctoral supervision team. Formally, you will be a member of the Marketing Chair group, which is part of the Department of Business Administration.

Are you a highly motivated aspiring junior researcher? Do you have a background in the history of philosophy, logic and science in the later middle ages? Do you want to develop your own innovative research ideas as a key member of a research team? The Center for the History of Philosophy and Science (CHPS) of the Faculty of Philosophy, Theology and Religious Studies is looking to appoint a PhD candidate for the duration of four years, to conduct research on 'Marsilius of Inghen on imagination and impossibility in logic and metaphysics'.

You will join Dr Ciola's research team and work closely with her, another PhD candidate and a postdoctoral researcher, contributing to the ERC Starting Grant project 'The Impossible and the Imaginable: Late-Medieval Semantics of Impossibility and the Roots of Complex Mathematics'. You can find a description of the project here.

You will produce original research on Marsilius of Inghen's views on possibility, impossibility and imaginability, in the form of a doctoral dissertation and several scientific articles. You will work on technical theories in late medieval semantics, such as supposition and ampliation, and assess how Marsilius's views on empty terms play out across his logical, metaphysical and scientific works. You will also explore 'big ideas' (the possible, the impossible, the imaginable) and broader intellectual movements, contextualising Marsilius's own commitment to impossibilia and assessing it against the views of 14th-century philosophers in the same intellectual tradition, such as John Buridan, Albert of Saxony, Nicole Oresme and Peter of Ailly. You will bring your own interests, skills and particular expertise to enrich your project and the work of the team as a whole. You will collaborate with the other members of the team in various research, dissemination and outreach activities, and you will actively participate to the CHPS's analogous initiatives. The Center has a very cohesive research group. Its members gather daily in a friendly, informal and intellectually lively environment. They share their research in work-in-progress meetings, and they co-teach, co-publish, and co-organise conferences. PhD supervision is of high quality, not at the least because of the daily presence of supervisors and supervisees at the department.

This research position carries no teaching obligations.
Profile
You hold a Master's degree in the History of Philosophy, the History of Science, or in Logic.
You have a strong background in medieval philosophy, and are well acquainted with scholastic terminology.
You have strong conceptual skills.
Your written and spoken English skills are excellent.
You possess excellent reading skills in Latin.
You are acquainted with the basic techniques and fundamental issues in contemporary logic, the philosophy of logic, and the philosophy of language, at least on the issues most relevant for the project.
You are an autonomous researcher, who also likes to work in a team and who has excellent communication and organisational skills.
Knowledge of some paleography and experience handling late-medieval manuscripts would be an advantage.

About the project

Parental involvement in a child's education, including talking and reading to them, has been linked to better academic performance. However, it is unclear whether this association is causal or due to other factors such as genetics. To identify the causal effects of the home learning environment, we need to control for genetics. The InterGen project aims to discover which aspects of the home learning environment causally impact children's language, reading, and math development. In the InterGen project, we will use a variety of innovative observational and experimental designs to study gene-environment interplay in children's educational development, like the children-of-twin design and a randomized controlled study. The InterGen project is funded by an ERC Starting Grant.

Are you interested in how higher education institutes (HEIs) can create an environment that promotes student well-being and learning? Are you interested in how university programmes can play their part in current planetary crises through education for sustainability? We have an opening for a PhD candidate devoted to transcending the disciplinary boundaries between transformative learning theories, the philosophy of social sciences and education for sustainability. Are you ready to play your part?


For decades, debates have stressed the various crises HEIs are currently facing. On the one hand, student well-being has come under pressure, as recent reports show that many students experience stress, academic pressure, and little attention for personal development. On the other, there is a vast discrepancy between knowledge building and building of wisdom or action, the so-called knowledge-action gap, particularly in the field of sustainability. While transformative education approaches have been designed to meet these challenges, they are often implemented outside of the regular programmes of HEIs and based on project funding, limiting their long-lasting potential.


This PhD project focuses on the design, implementation and impact on students of transformative education practices for sustainability at HEIs. In these practices, learning is conceptualised as action, taking place in context, and conducted together. In this project you will conceptualise and co-create learning environments by putting transformative theories of education for sustainability into regular academic practice. You will use both quantitative and qualitative methods. A more elaborate description of this project can be requested from Petrie or Saskia (see contact details below).


You will be employed at the Behavioural Science Institute (BSI), embedded in the Learning & Plasticity research programme. As a PhD candidate, you will work together with four researchers who have diverse disciplinary backgrounds (sustainability pedagogy, philosophy of behavioural sciences, student success and diversity in higher education, educational sciences). You will be asked to bridge these paradigms and you will have ample opportunity to further design your own PhD project.


As a PhD candidate, you will initiate, develop and execute several studies. You will write a PhD thesis to complete your project. You will participate in supervision meetings as well as staff meetings of the Learning & Plasticity department and other relevant research meetings. As part of the BSI Graduate School PhD programme, you will be expected to complete several courses related to the basic professional skills of scientific researchers such as presentation skills, scientific integrity, and data management. We will also encourage you to attend and present your work at relevant workshops and conferences. As part of your PhD position, you will have a 10% teaching load and the opportunity to work towards a university teaching qualification.
Profile
You hold a Master's or Research Master's degree in behavioural science, educational sciences, pedagogical sciences, philosophy of behavioural sciences, biology, or a related field.
You are able to critically reflect on theories in the field of social sciences and you are strong in conceptualisation.
You have an affinity for various research methods.
You have an affinity for interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary problems/work.
You are familiar with or would like to become familiar with research in higher education, transformative education and education for sustainability, student well-being and diversity.
You are a team player with good social skills, but are also able to work independently and proactively.
You have excellent written and spoken English language skills (required for scientific publishing).

You will join the Learning and Plasticity group. The Learning and Plasticity group conducts fundamental and applied research on individual differences in the learning and development of children, teenagers and adolescents.

Individual differences lie at the heart of our research. We study variations between and within homogeneous age samples in order to describe, predict and explain how people learn and develop. We focus on both typically developing groups and samples with an atypical development in one or more areas (e.g. attention deficits, visual impairment, coordination disorder, giftedness).

Our research relates individual differences in learning and development to characteristics of the individual, the knowledge and skills they have to acquire and the context in which their learning and development takes place.

The outer ring of the doughnut chart represents the main application areas of our research. Each area comes with specific themes, which are prompted by either academic or societal relevance and shape the research questions we seek to answer. Examples include differentiated forms of teaching, learning, treatment and intervention, adaptive and dynamic assessments, and policy measures regarding equal opportunities and inclusive education.

The Learning and Plasticity group is part of the Behavioural Science Institute (BSI). BSI is a multidisciplinary research institute and one of three research institutes in the Faculty of Social Sciences at Radboud University.

Our researchers collaborate across the boundaries of psychology, educational science, and communication science. Our mission is to strengthen people through understanding the foundations of human behaviour, by creating synergy between different paradigms and by facilitating craftsmanship, curiosity and connection in academic research.

In English, 'uptalk' (the use of pitch rises at the end of statements) can evoke strong reactions; e.g. uptalk is seen as a marker of insecurity and hesitance used primarily by young women. As a PhD candidate, you will critically evaluate the existing literature on British English uptalk and carry out production studies and perception experiments to understand the phonetic forms uptalk can take, its pragmatic functions, and its social evaluation.

We are looking for a PhD candidate in sociophonetics, focusing on the study of prosody, for a project on uptalk in British English. Uptalk is defined as the use of pitch rises (instead of falls) at the end of statements. Stereotypically, uptalk is said to indicate speaker insecurity or a cooperative attitude, while its use has been associated with younger women who are often said to talk as if they are asking questions.

There are, however, many issues with these stereotypes about uptalk. First, there are many varieties of British English (e.g. in Bristol, Liverpool, and Tyneside) in which rises are used by default at the end of statements. These rises are not considered instances of uptalk on the grounds that they do not convey some special meaning. This implies that uptalk carries such special meaning, but speakers of varieties said to have uptalk (e.g. varieties in New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and California) do not assign special meaning to all instances of uptalk. This begs the question of what counts as uptalk and what criteria can be used to determine if uptalk is a feature of a given linguistic variety. Further, research in uptalking varieties of English suggests that uptalk has diverse uses and that different forms of uptalk may be associated with different pragmatic functions. Finally, these studies also suggest that uptalk is not used exclusively by certain demographic groups, such as young women; in turn, this indicates that uptalk may be wider spread but noticeable only when used by speakers of certain groups because the stereotypes of the listeners lead them to expect uptalk only from these groups.

Given the above uncertainties, the aim of this project is to critically evaluate the existing research on uptalk from phonetic, pragmatic, and sociolinguistic perspectives, focusing on British English uses and users of uptalk. The goals of the project include a thorough documentation of the forms that uptalk can take, a better understanding of the pragmatics associated with it and of the social evaluation that it leads to, depending on the demographics of the users.

For this project, you will be supervised by a team of researchers consisting of Prof. Amalia Arvaniti (Chair), Dr Stefan Gronderlaers and Dr Jarret Geenen (co-supervisors). Though the scope of the project is indicated above, it is expected that the final research plan will be developed in collaboration with you to reflect your research interests as well as those of the PhD committee.

Your teaching load will be up to 10% of your working time.

Profile
You hold a Master's degree in linguistics.
You have demonstrable grounding in at least two of the following: phonetics, sociolinguistics, pragmatics.
You have an excellent command of written and spoken English.
You have an understanding of socially related variation in British English or a sufficient background in the study of variation to quickly acquire the background necessary for this project.
You have a good understanding of either corpus-based or experimental methods in linguistics preferably demonstrated by work experience, publications, or a relevant Master's thesis.
Demonstrable interest in the study of prosody will be a strong advantage.
We are

As a PhD candidate, you will be affiliated with Radboud's Centre for Language Studies (CLS).

Are you an aspiring scientist in the field of cognitive neuroscience, looking to start your academic career off right? Then join the world-renowned Donders Institute as a PhD candidate and work with top-notch experimental equipment to build computational models of body representation, both somatosensory and multisensory.

We are looking for a motivated PhD candidate with interest and expertise in building computational models of body representation, both somatosensory and multisensory.

You will be part of the ERC funded project 'The Body Positioning System: A GPS for somatosensory space'. The goal of the project is to uncover how the brain localises touch on a body whose three-dimensional posture changes from moment to moment (The Body Positioning System). How does the brain transform sensory input on the skin to a full-fledged three-dimensional body representation? To make headway on this fundamental question, we will use a variety of neuroscientific approaches, such as behavioural and M/EEG experiments that employ novel virtual reality and robot-based paradigms. We will also leverage several analytical tools, such as computational modelling and machine learning.

As a PhD candidate, you will design novel, real-world behavioural paradigms to measure tactile localisation in three-dimensional space. Importantly, you will then use computational modelling to characterise and identify the mechanisms underlying the localization behaviour. The goal of these models is to understand the transformations used by the Body Positioning System. Your work is likely to involve close collaboration with fellow members of the team, including colleagues from other departments at the Donders Institute. Project management, mentoring BSc and MSc students, and teaching-related tasks will also be part of your responsibilities.

Profile

PhD candidate in GUTS consortium, Data Science for Interdisciplinary Research (1,0FTE)
Vacancy number 13587
Are you interested in interdisciplinary research investigating the factors that contribute to optimal conditions for youth development? Consider joining the Growing Up Together in Society (GUTS) consortium as a PhD student and gain the skills and knowledge to conduct cutting-edge research on data science as part of a dynamic interdisciplinary team.
Applications are invited for a four-year PhD position under the supervision of prof. Mark de Rooij (Methodology and Statistics Unit), prof. Hilde Huizinga (Uva), and dr. Marjolein Fokkema in the Growing Up Together in Society (GUTS) consortium, a collaboration among seven Dutch universities. We are looking for an enthusiastic student who would like to develop their career in the field of data science in an interdisciplinary environment.

Project description
How can young people navigate the challenges of a complex society and become engaged, contributing citizens? This is the central question of the Growing Up Together in Society (GUTS) consortium, a collaboration among seven Dutch universities. In the consortium, this central question is approached from different perspectives: a brain development perspective, a genetic perspective, a social environment perspective, and a personality perspective. Your PhD project will focus on bringing the results from these different perspectives into one overall interdisciplinary, umbrella theory.
This PhD position on Data Science for Interdisciplinary Research aims to set up, test, and apply a new Ensemble Methodology to bring together disciplinary theory into an overarching interdisciplinary, umbrella theory. The new methodology, called Stacked Domain Learning, has three advantages compared to simply concatenating the data together and using an existing method: first, it acknowledges scientific reasoning and progress so far; second, it gives information on which domain is important for accurate prediction; third, it takes into account the different (measurement) properties of the domains.
If you are passionate about getting usable knowledge from complex data and communicating your efforts to developmental, neuroscience, genetic, and social researchers, then we encourage you to apply for this exciting opportunity to be part of the GUTS consortium. You will have the chance to develop your research skills, work with a dynamic team, and make a valuable contribution to science.
The qualifications needed for this position include:
A completed (research) master's degree in statistics, data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, or a related field;
Experience in R programming (or a similar language), Monte Carlo simulation studies, and data analysis;
A passion for interdisciplinary scientific research;
A collaborative mindset, openness to learning new skills, and willingness to share knowledge;
Excitement about setting up a large study with fellow PhD students, attention to detail, and clear communication skills.

Faculty Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science
The Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS) brings together three scientific disciplines. Combined, they reinforce each other and are the driving force behind the technology we all use in our daily lives. Technology such as the electricity grid, which our faculty is helping to make completely sustainable and future-proof. At the same time, we are developing the chips and sensors of the future, whilst also setting the foundations for the software technologies to run on this new generation of equipment – which of course includes AI. Meanwhile we are pushing the limits of applied mathematics, for example mapping out disease processes using single cell data, and using mathematics to simulate gigantic ash plumes after a volcanic eruption. In other words: there is plenty of room at the faculty for ground-breaking research. We educate innovative engineers and have excellent labs and facilities that underline our strong international position. In total, more than 1000 employees and 4,000 students work and study in this innovative environment.

Additional information
Education and Students Affairs (ESA) department

You will work in the Education and Students Affairs (ESA) department. Working at the EEMCS faculty, you start the working day with a nice coffee and go over the to-list of your week with your partner Official Secretary. Together you look after 3 Bachelor's and 5 master's programmes. You don't do that alone; the ESA team consists of academic counsellors, programme coordinators, the international office, Assessment Advisor and management assistants. The team is characterised by driven, flexible and social colleagues with a heart for education and people. Personal contact with students, lecturers and colleagues is of paramount importance. Your colleagues will therefore welcome you with open arms. Regarding the work of the Board of Examiners, you are the first point of contact for staff, students and guests. The work field is very varied and every day is different. On one working day, for example, you might be making graduate students happy with a diploma, point teachers to legal education rules and guidelines, support in handling an appeal case and inform students about the graduation procedure. On the other day, you deal with fraud cases, advise a programme coordinator on exam regulations and walk to another building for a meeting with one of your sub-Boards. And in between, have a nice lunch with your colleagues.

The ESA team considers a working environment in which everyone feels welcome and appreciated very important. A working environment in which attention is paid to people and individual qualities regardless of religion, origin, age and gender. Together, we strive for a working environment where we embrace differences. We therefore like to invite candidates who can contribute to this through their background and experience.

The Board of Examiners

In a nutshell, the Official Secretary is the operational manager and advisor of the Board of Examiners of the faculty of EEMCS. The main task of a Board of Examiners is to ensure the quality of examinations. Among other things, the Board of Examiners determines whether a student meets the learning outcomes of programme and can graduate, decides on exemptions, approving courses from other universities and personal request from students
