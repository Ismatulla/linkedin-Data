Consultant Energy Markets & Strategy,"Local Unit & Position Description:

Do you want to be involved and make a difference in the realization of the energy transition? Do you want to support our customers develop and deliver successful strategies as part of the journey to a green, smart and secure energy system? Then you may find the role as a Consultant - Energy Markets & Strategy (EMS) in DNV to be a great next step in your career.
Our Energy Markets and Strategy (EMS) team based in Arnhem (NL) is looking for a Consultant to support its fast-growing business. The team is made up of an international group of young, ambitious and talented consultants, all working on challenging projects in energy market and system development, business case analysis and strategic advisory services.
Typical clients will vary and include utilities across the energy supply chain: energy companies, network operators, investors, regulators and governments. Country markets served from our northern European teams include the Benelux, the Nordic countries, Germany and Eastern Europe. Besides these markets, the team often cooperates closely with similar teams in the UK, southern Europe, the US, South America, the Middle East and Asia-Pacific.
ABOUT THE ENERGY MARKETS AND STRATEGY DEPARTMENT (EMS)
EMS combines deep expertise of energy markets and regulations, renewable energy technologies, gas and electricity networks, and (new) business models to advise stakeholders in the energy transition. Our clients span the full energy value chain and include manufacturers, utilities, investors, regulators and governments. Our services involve techno-economic assessment, research and innovation, strategy and management consulting, as well as policy and regulatory advice. Our overall objective is to help the energy sector to develop viable and economic solutions to support the transition to a clean, affordable and secure energy system as part of the route to Net Zero.
ROLE & KEY RESPONSIBILITIES
The role as consultant focusses on supporting our clients with economic, strategic and/ or regulatory advice to help find the best way through the Energy Transition, often in alignment with colleagues from more technical departments that harbor experts in specific technologies, such as renewables, storage, grids or hydrogen. You will help our customers understand and overcome strategic and regulatory challenges, assess the technical and commercial viability of innovative technologies/solutions and business models, and help to understand and manage the risks around investment and policy decisions. This can mean an optimized return for investors from an electrolyzer for green hydrogen production, optimizing the dispatch of a large-scale battery by acting on different wholesale and ancillary services markets, or working out least-cost solutions for an entire country to secure long-term clean energy supply. Projects are typically executed in teams of 2-5 people, offering lots of opportunity to learn from experienced senior and principal colleagues.
As a consultant, your goals will be composed of a mix of project work, contributions to sales and team development, and (development of your) soft skills.
