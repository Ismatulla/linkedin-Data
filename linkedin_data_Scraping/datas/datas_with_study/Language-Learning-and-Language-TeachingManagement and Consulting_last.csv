KYC analyst,"Ever thought about combatting financial crime for a living? As a KYC analyst (KYC stands for ‘Know Your Client’) you’re on the crossroads of reviewing client documentation and doing behavioural analysis. The prevalence of financial crime is a substantial threat to the development of global economies, that’s exactly why we’re looking for people who want to make a positive impact.
As a KYC analyst, you’ll primarily review documentation for new customer accounts, evaluate high-risk accounts and analyse new customer processes and policies. There’s also a strong focus on keeping up to date with market trends and observing customer behaviour patterns within the organization.
But there’s no need to worry, as soon as you start, you’ll be part of an in-depth programme, teaching you all the skills you need to become the best possible version of yourself. This programme will primarily focus on:
1. Data: Without data there is no way you can detect financial crime. That’s why you will learn how to maximize the value of databases and write in SQL.
2. Financial crime: Getting a good understanding of how the financial chain actually works.
3. Soft skills: Besides the theory, we’ll also guide you when it comes to the people-side of things.
Want to know more about this track and how you can be in charge of what you want to focus on? Simply apply and we’ll happily tell you all about it!

Next to being a team player with a passion for data who’s not scared to step out of their comfort zone, you also:

Have an academic background in Business, Finance and/or Criminology (at least bachelor level)
Are motivated to build a career in the financial sector
Fluently speak Dutch & English. Other languages definitely are a plus.
Are a critical and analytical thinker
Highly value integrity
