Planning and Scheduling Officer,"Are you looking for a new opportunity in a fast-moving global company with a family feel? A job where you could have an impact?

On behalf of ESA, we are looking for a Planning and Scheduling Officer to work at ESTEC’s premises in Noordwijk, The Netherlands.

In this role the key individual will report to the Mars Project Control Team Leader and work on a daily basis with the project controllers and project teams of the ExoMars Rosalind Franklin Mission, the Earth Return Orbiter and the Sample Transfer Arm projects.

About the client and location

ESA missions are at the forefront of human exploration. Building on a strong heritage in human spaceflight and the successful ISS and ATV programmes, ESA in collaboration with its international partners have turned their gaze to deep space and have laid the foundations for the journey to Mars. The first exciting step on this journey is returning humans to the Moon and establishing a sustainable human presence in deep space, which will be achieved through the Artemis Programme. The European Service Module (ESM) is ESA’s contribution to the Orion vehicle, which will shuttle humans to and from the Moon. It will dock with a new space station known as the Gateway, the portal through which humans can access different landing sites on the Moon. It is also a safe haven, a facility for science and robotic surface operations as well as refuelling depot for lunar landers. ESA is providing the I-HAB module, which is the habitat housing four crew for up to six months, and the ESPRIT module, which provides vital communications and the refuelling capabilities. Overall, this infrastructure will provide repeated access to the surface of the moon, both for astronauts and rovers. Initial goal is to re-take lunar scientific exploration with much newer means and instrumentation, but the final goal is to build the experience and confidence to eventually send humans to the surface of Mars.
