The central question of this project is how we can conceptualize the moral role of technological products and systems, and what implications this conceptualization may have for ethical analysis. The aim is to develop new theories and approaches for analyzing the moral role of technology.

One of the key challenges of ethical analysis in the context of technology is the question of whether technological products are only instruments that modify human moral action, or whether they can be characterized as moral agents or co-agents in their own right. For instance, what is the moral role of guns in causing harm? While humans ultimately pull the trigger, guns have affordances that make killing much easier, with less risk for the shooter. Similarly, what is the role of self-driving cars in causing harm or violating rights? Here, a human operator is not even directly involved. Should we therefore assign moral responsibility to self-driving cars? And how should ethical analysis proceed? Current approaches in ethics of technology often do not have good answers to these questions.

In addition to analyzing individual technological products with individual users, this project will also focus on larger systems with multiple technological components and human operators. Such systems include both sociotechnical systems – predominantly technical systems with human operators and enablers, such as electricity networks, industrial production systems, and the Internet – and technosocial systems – predominantly social systems that rely on technology, such as modern organizations and associations. The project will investigate how we can describe the moral role of these systems, how they produce moral outcomes, and how we can attribute causal and moral responsibility to humans and machines in them.

To achieve these goals, the project will study existing approaches in ethics, especially ethics of technology, to make explicit what roles are assigned to technology and to assess the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches. Existing conceptualizations of technological products can also be explored, in the fields of philosophy of technology, science and technology studies (STS), technology assessment, and/or impact assessment.

The project will be mostly theoretical, but it will also involve a number of case studies of particular technologies that are to be selected by the PhD student, in consultation with supervisors, for example of autonomous vehicles, Internet-of-Things, human enhancement technologies, or any others that are deemed useful for the study.

This project is funded by the ESDiT research program and will be located within the Department of Philosophy at the University of Twente. For description of both, see below. It will be supervised by Prof. dr. Philip Brey and dr. Adam Henschke at the Department of Philosophy of the University of Twente.

The Institute of Public Administration at Leiden University is for a
PhD Candidate for the research project “Administrative Attention amidst Political Failure”
Project description
Amidst an affluence of societal challenges and an abundance of information, political processes increasingly result in unclear and inconsistent policy objectives. Amidst such “political failure”, public managers rely on performance information to define how societal problems and causal origins should be understood and which policy solution should be selected to remedy the problem. Public managers possess historically unrivaled information about the many societal challenges that government seeks to address. Paradoxically, this abundance of information leads to an ever-increasing scarcity of attention, as the available information greatly exceeds managers’ information-processing capacities.
The Institute of Public Administration seeks to recruit a PhD Candidate to contribute to the broader NWO Vidi project “Administrative Attention amidst Political Failure” by conducting a PhD research project. The focus of the PhD research project is to provide further theoretical and practical understanding of public managers’ search behavior in response to societal and organizational challenges. Search behavior concerns the processing of information to define the relevant characteristics and causal origins (problem-definition search), as well as to identify and generate the potential policy solutions (solution-generating search).
As part of the broader project team, the successful applicant will utilize experimental research methods (for instance survey experiments, lab-in-the-field experiments) to empirically analyze and evaluate these search behaviors. In particular, the PhD candidate will seek to inform the occurrence (i.e. when do public managers search?), locus (i.e. where do public managers search?), and sequence (i.e. in what order to managers search for problem and solution-related information?) of search behavior. The PhD candidate will also design and conduct research to examine how the dynamics of search behavior are dependent on the presence of political failure.
Tasks and responsibilities
The PhD candidate is expected
To design and implement scientific research on the information processing behavior of public managers. In line with the broader project, the research methodology will consist of experimental designs and methods to inform public managers’ attention allocation as information processing behavior.
To disseminate research findings by publishing scientific articles in international peer-reviewed journals and presenting research at academic conferences.
To communicate scientific findings to evidence for practice, for instance through publications in practitioner-oriented journals or websites, the development of trainings and/or interventions for practice, and participation in practice-oriented debates about public management and decision-making.
To participate in and support the research and dissemination activities of the broader research project.
To take part in relevant disciplinary and/or research methods courses, based on an individual training and supervision plan (approximately 10% of the appointment).
To contribute to the teaching programs of the Institute of Public Administration (approximately 10% of the appointment), with the opportunity to obtain the Basic Teaching Qualification (BKO).
Selection criteria
A (research) master’s degree in social sciences with excellent study results, including public administration and/or public management, political science, public policy, general or business management, organizational sciences, economics, sociology, or (organizational) psychology. Students who will obtain their master’s degree before the start date of 1 September 2023 are encouraged to apply;
Experience with quantitative analysis and an interest in (survey) experimental research design;
Interest in and affinity with communicating scientific insights to practice.
Excellent spoken and written proficiency in English. Proficiency in Dutch can be considered an asset, yet international candidates are strongly encouraged to apply;
Experience with software for statistical analysis (for instance r/rstudio, stata) and survey research (for instance Qualtrics);
The capacity to work both independently as well as collaboratively with the project team;
Good organizational and communicative skills;
The capacity to work in a creative and curiosity-driven way, with a good eye for detail.
The Faculty and Institute
Science for and about society is the domain of the Faculty of Governance and Global Affairs (FGGA). FGGA provides high-quality interdisciplinary education and research on social and governance issues such as terrorism, organization of public administration, climate change and economic crises.
Contemporary issues are approached from an administrative, political, economic, legal and sociological perspective. This interdisciplinary approach gives the faculty's education and research a cross-border character.
The Faculty of Governance and Global Affairs (FGGA) is one of the seven faculties of Leiden University and is based in The Hague.

It employs around 80 people and provides education to 1200 students. The successful candidate will be a member of the research group on Public Management and Leadership.
Terms and conditions
We offer a full-time appointment of initially one year. After a positive evaluation of the progress of the research, teaching evaluations, personal capabilities and compatibility, the appointment will be extended for another three years. Salary range starts from € 2.541,- gross per month up to € 3.247,- gross per month (salary scale P in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities).
Leiden University offers an attractive benefits package with additional holiday (8%) and end-of-year bonuses (8.3 %), training and career development and sabbatical leave. Our individual choices model gives you some freedom to assemble your own set of terms and conditions. For international spouses we have set up a dual career programme.

Director of Finance & Control,"Job description
TU/e
Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) is an internationally prominent university of technology that educates engineers of the future. TU/e is a young university that has grown to global significance in a relatively short time. The university is known for its high scientific impact and the development of technological innovations and applications that provide solutions to complex social issues.
Brainport Eindhoven
TU/e is located in the center of one of the most powerful technology hubs in the world: Brainport Eindhoven. The Brainport Eindhoven region is home to a multitude of technological knowledge institutes and high-tech companies, from renowned multinationals such as ASML, Philips, NXP and VDL to innovative small and medium-sized enterprises and groundbreaking start-ups and spin-offs. The university of technology is part of Brainport Eindhoven. The campus is an attractive and lively hotspot where students, researchers, entrepreneurs and high-tech companies can meet and collaborate.
Brainport is considered a core economic region of national significance. To enable further prosperity, the Dutch cabinet has drawn up a strategic growth agenda together with the Brainport region. The intended growth requires substantially more students and engineering graduates in the region. This compels the university to accelerate its growth. TU/e’s ambition is now to double the number of master’s graduates by 2032.
Organization
TU/e is a public university financed largely by public funds. At the end of 2022, TU/e had a balance sheet total of around 600 m euros with income of over 475 m euros. The university has a multi-year investment budget of nearly 600 m euros in challenging programs for the TU/e Campus, laboratories and digitization, with a special focus on sustainability and (cyber)security. Over 13,000 students and about 2,000 PhD students and designers study at TU/e and there are over 4,000 employees.
The Executive Board is responsible for the management of TU/e while the Supervisory Board oversees the supervision. The university is organized into nine departments, four research institutes and various collaborative units in the field of education, and ten services that support the primary process. Each service is headed by a director. A new director is now being sought for the Finance & Control service.
THE FINANCE & CONTROL SERVICE
The Finance & Control service department is responsible for the development of the financial strategy and policy, as well as finance operations. The service department manages activities in the fields of procurement, financial administration, reporting, corporate control, and business and project control. It does this for a multitude of units within TU/e: departments, institutes, services, and various partnerships and participations. The service department provides targeted support for the realization of several thousand research and education projects and investment programs. In total, Finance & Control employs over 120 people. They help boards, departments, management and divisions to realize their ambitions in education, research and valorization in an efficient and transparent manner.
The service department is in a state of flux. During the recent period, we identified how the financial position is increasingly changing and what this requires of the service department and of the development of the financial professional. In addition, SQUAD (Support Quality Drive) was started: an intensive multi-year improvement program aimed at sustainably optimizing the quality and efficiency of the (integral) service provision of all support services. This includes a more service-oriented way of working that is in line with the entrepreneurship of the university. In the process, a new ERP environment for finance and procurement will be implemented in 2024. Although the various initiatives were started in parallel and at different times, they are simultaneously closely intertwined and mutually reinforcing. Meanwhile, good insights have now been gained into what is needed in the coming period in order to realize a more customer-geared service that is future-oriented and in which the right quality and competencies are represented so that education and research can be optimally served. The service is ready for the next step towards implementation.
We are now seeking for an authoritative and unifying director who will further guide the development task and realize a solid and future-proof F&C service, thereby helping to enable the ambitions of TU/e.

THE POSITION AND THE CHALLENGE
The Director of Finance & Control is ultimately responsible for the functioning of the service and is therefore ultimately responsible for the development of the financial strategy and policy and for the finance operations. The director manages the five-member Management Team (MT) of the service department. In addition, the director is the strategic advisor to the Executive Board. The director reports to the portfolio holder in the Executive Board and has a functional line to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board.
Leadership
TU/e is a young university and has grown rapidly and significantly in size and diversity in recent years. Against this background and in light of the growth ambitions, there is continuous reflection on the best possible set-up and steering of the organization, and the leadership to match. Directors and deans are now being asked to think strategically about the development of TU/e and to operate according to an integral and shared responsibility. For the new director, this is a good moment to step in and help build a strong TU/e brand based on his or her own experiences, vision and personality.
Strategic recommendations
The Director of F&C is a very important strategic advisor to the Executive Board. Based on the financial portfolio, the director is expected to provide the Executive Board with solicited and unsolicited recommendations on developments, opportunities and (the management of) risks surrounding the university's strategic themes in relation to, for example, the multi-year budget and to offer professional countervailing power when necessary. To this end, the director has financial expertise, a broad business perspective and orientation, and is able to look beyond the boundaries of the financial position.
Development task
The service department’s transition was initiated via several tracks. The development of the financial position, the SQUAD program and the implementation of the new ERP system are closely intertwined but have different starting points and speeds, and run alongside the going concern work. As a result, the workload is felt to be high. A director is sought who recognizes the changing financial field, as well as the demand for a service approach that supports the university’s entrepreneurship. You have the ability to channel the work and the perception surrounding initiatives and provide a more unified direction. You know how to chart a clear dot on the horizon and guide people towards it. You have vision, provide frameworks and structure, and stay on course. As a result, you provide calm and stability, as well as momentum towards results. You encourage proactive, creative and flexible thinking within the frameworks and increasing complexity of financing and accountability in the educational environment. The MT is formed of substantively strong professionals with ambitions and the drive to continuously learn and be successful. They look forward to a director who will further strengthen them as a team.
You explicitly seek out collaboration with your fellow service department directors, the deans and the directors of business operations of the departments for whom you are the figurehead and point of contact for the service, authoritatively fulfilling the role of advisor and collaboration/sparring partner. You are able to translate financial topics in a comprehensible manner according to the (needs of the) broad and more generalized administrative layers of the organization. You have experience in demanding and demand-driven environments with autonomous, highly educated professionals in the public field and understand the dynamics of change in such environments.
Stakeholders
The Director of Finance & Control has a broad range of stakeholders. You work closely with the Executive Board, the deans and directors of business operations of the departments, and the directors of your fellow support service departments. In addition, you maintain contact with the various (research) institutes, special programs and joint ventures and, as Director of F&C of the TU/e group, you are also indirectly responsible for/have a collaborative role with TU/e Participations BV, which includes 60 participations. Naturally, you are an important interlocutor in the relationship with banks and accountants. Furthermore, you maintain a network with other regional and national (collaboration) partners and you have an important role in the representation of TU/e in national partnerships such as UNL. Within this framework, a director is sought who has a good understanding of the various roles and responsibilities within this position and who will handle them in a professional manner.
Investment task
In order to finance the university’s continued growth and the intended extensive programs in areas such as ICT and campus development, the investment task for the coming years will be a point of attention in the short term. The F&C service department and the director play a prominent and active role in this regard. In relation to this, the director works closely with the directors of the ICT, Real Estate and Facility Center services, among others. In addition, the envisioned scale jump requires specific attention. The director fulfills a key role in this when it comes, among other things, to (financial) substantiation and collaboration in the Brainport context and with the government. Ideally, the new director will have previous concrete experience with major investment projects and will have gained relevant expertise in financial steering and risk management.
In summary, the new director is assigned a marvelous task within the dynamic interplay of education, research and valorization in TU/e’s ambitious environment. A fantastic environment for someone who understands the task of further professionalization and is able to channel the ongoing initiatives to this end, thereby creating a smooth F&C service department operation which is customer-oriented and compliant. We are looking for a director who brings both calm and drive.
The ideal Director of F&C has a university business economics or business administration degree and a broad business and managerial background. You have experience in a large and complex public or semi-public organization, preferably in a knowledge-intensive environment. You have ideally led multiple complex change projects in different organizations and understand the dynamics in changing environments. You are an inspiring leader and know how to stimulate people and professionals to grow within these dynamics. You know how to set and follow a course within the interplay. You have an excellent antenna for mutual relationships and interests, and you are diplomatic. You can advise a board at a strategic level, transcending the financial position, in a solicited and unsolicited manner. You do this in a unifying manner and have authority.

Technology such as the electricity grid, which our faculty is helping to make completely sustainable and future-proof. At the same time, we are developing the chips and sensors of the future, whilst also setting the foundations for the software technologies to run on this new generation of equipment – which of course includes AI. Meanwhile we are pushing the limits of applied mathematics, for example mapping out disease processes using single cell data, and using mathematics to simulate gigantic ash plumes after a volcanic eruption. In other words: there is plenty of room at the faculty for ground-breaking research. We educate innovative engineers and have excellent labs and facilities that underline our strong international position. In total, more than 1000 employees and 4,000 students work and study in this innovative environment.

Developing organizational arrangements for artificial intelligence in public surveillance
Job description
We are looking for an enthusiastic PhD candidate with a background in the field of policy analysis, public administration, policy sciences or a related field to study and develop organizational implementation arrangements for Artificial Intelligence (AI) for regulatory surveillance. The position is a for 4-year PhD track, financed by the Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management, department of Multi-Actor Systems in close collaboration with regulatory agencies.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly used in regulatory processes. No wonder, AI promises a more effective regulatory supervision process, in which inspectors on the floor are advised on the basis of AI-generated risk analysis. Technically there are still many development possibilities. However, whether AI can be applied effectively and responsibly also raises organizational issues, such as:
Professionalism of the inspectors. Risk analyses were conducted before the AI era. These often took place in the minds of professional inspectors and/or during work meetings. In other words: not only data, but also inspectors are an important source of knowledge about risks. Their knowledge is often implicit and based on years of experience. Application of AI can count on resistance from professionals. Not only that: too aggressive application of AI can come at the expense of their valuable knowledge.
Data pollution. Too much risk-based supervision can lead to data pollution: data mainly comes in from those under supervision who have previously been identified as being high-risk. Other people under supervision can thus remain out of sight. They can change their behaviour. There will therefore always be a demand for risk-based random supervision, in which random samples are also used for supervision. Within an organization there are different ideas about the right ratio.
Ethical issues. There is a lot of discussion about bias, protection of vulnerable individuals, transparency and privacy. Of course, these discussions also exist internally. This means that those involved – data scientists, inspectors, managers – make trade-offs between values. Many decisions about data and algorithms can be leading for the outcomes. These decisions increasingly seem to be made 'at the front', the data experts. This presents challenges with regard to the management of the data experts.

Based on these signals, we conclude that further development of AI has both technical and organizational dimensions. Successful development and implementation of AI will therefore have to be linked to the organization of supervisory practices.

How are technical development of AI and the supervisory organization connected and how can this connection be improved? Much literature on AI focuses on technical possibilities, while other literature deals with ethical concerns. Far less literature discusses the actual implementation and use of AI in organizational practice. A study into this subject should have two characteristics:
The research is interdisciplinary. It has both innovative-technical aspects and social-scientific aspects. The question is about the interplay between the two.
Connected to practice. We are looking for the application of AI in the context of practice. That is why we want to conduct empirical research, using one or more cases. The research will be carried out in close collaboration with the Dutch Food and Product Safety Authority (NVWA).
Requirements
In this project you will study and develop arrangements that bring together the world of AI and managements of surveillance.

This requires understanding of AI (data science, machine learning, programming) and more intangible processes of organization, including organization structures, informal coordination and organizational politics. It includes both analysis and design efforts. It will involve conducting case studies at NVWA

We are looking for someone who:
has a Master's degree and a background in policy analysis, public administration or a related field
has affinity (and preferably also demonstratable experience) with AI
has affinity (and preferably also experience) with organizational science
has the ability and interest to cross disciplinary boundaries
is fluent in English, both written and orally
has pro-active communication skills and is able to work well in a team

Doing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and a final thesis. For more details please check the Graduate Schools Admission Requirements.

Since the project is developed in close cooperation with a Dutch inspection agency (NVWA) that mostly communicates in Dutch, a candidate that speaks Dutch or is willing to learn the Dutch language is preferred.
Conditions of employment
Doctoral candidates will be offered a 4-year period of employment in principle, but in the form of 2 employment contracts. An initial 1,5 year contract with an official go/no go progress assessment within 15 months. Followed by an additional contract for the remaining 2,5 years assuming everything goes well and performance requirements are met.

Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities, increasing from € 2541 per month in the first year to € 3247 in the fourth year. As a PhD candidate you will be enrolled in the TU Delft Graduate School. The TU Delft Graduate School provides an inspiring research environment with an excellent team of supervisors, academic staff and a mentor. The Doctoral Education Programme is aimed at developing your transferable, discipline-related and research skills.

The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance and sport memberships, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged. For international applicants we offer the Coming to Delft Service and Partner Career Advice to assist you with your relocation.

Corporations are increasingly being challenged to reflect on their purpose. Indeed, the relentless pursuit of profit as the raison d’être for corporations has had detrimental implications for our planet, society, and even shareholders – calling corporations to identify with a purpose that enables sustainable development. Accordingly, an ever-louder chorus of industry leaders have been questioning the shareholder-centric approach to business conduct. For example, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, called on firms to serve a broader societal purpose and shared value creation, and leading business consultants are increasingly advising firms to pursue a purpose that helps to cultivate a deeper connection with employees, customers, and communities. Earlier research has shown that firms are responsive to this development as they are rolling out new purpose-driven strategies and implementing changes within their organizations. However, firms that are particularly challenged by this development are those operating in contested industries including, for example, energy, aviation, and fast food. For these firms, pursuing a purpose requires fundamentally rethinking their core business activities, revenue models, and strategy.

Therefore, this PhD project seeks to perform an in-depth, longitudinal study of how firms in contested industries engage in purpose-driven strategic renewal. The objective of this project is to identify and theorize about the challenges, practices, and consequences of implementing such renewal. We envision this project to draw from, and contribute to, the literature on stakeholder management, strategic renewal, and organizational change. An elaborate description of the project, including a brief literature review, and outline of methodology and societal relevance can be found here.
