Student project: Modeling of urine flow in a sensor for advanced urine sensing in a toilet,"Student project: Modeling of urine flow in a sensor for advanced urine sensing in a toilet
Research & development - Wageningen | More than two weeks ago
This project aims to validate and improve the design of the urine sensing prototype by modeling the flow and temperature changes through the prototype.
What you will do
What if we were able to diagnose patients at an early stage and with completely non-invasive methods? At OnePlanet Research Center we are working on BioSensing@Home as part of the Smart Bathroom program; aiming to develop a variety of advanced sensors for measuring health, integrated in and around the toilet.
Urine is an interesting fluid that contains many compounds that can be used to track someone’s health. As such, we have developed a prototype that allows the automatic analysis of urine in a non-invasive way. This prototype can be hung in a toilet to collect the urine and guide it past sensors.


In this project, we aim to validate and improve the design of this prototype using computational simulations with COMSOL. More specific, can we validate and improve the urine flow past the sensors. In addition, our prototype contains a temperature sensor. We will investigate by simulations if we can predict a user’s core temperature by measuring the urine temperature with our prototype. Besides computational simulations, the results of the simulations can be strengthened, or validated with experiments in the lab.


Note: in this project you don’t have to work with urine! Experiments in the lab can be performed with water.
Simulate fluid flow past sensors of the designed prototype.
Investigate the influence of different situations; flow rates, amount of fluid, incident angle etc..
Evaluate the design of current prototype and come up with suggestions for improvements.
Simulate temperature changes of the urine from the point of excretion to the sensor and investigate the possibility to predict the user’s core temperature.
Perform experiments in the lab to strengthen the results of the simulations.
What we do for you
We offer a challenging and international environment at the forefront of technology. OnePlanet is a young collaboration of 3 renowned and globally respected research institutes/universities: Wageningen University & Research, Radboud University, Radboud UMC, and imec. By joining the OnePlanet team, you will be part of a team of world changers, disruptive innovators, and practical thinkers. Here, your ideas will have an impact on our future lives.
Who you are
You are a MSc student in Physics, Biomedical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Technical Medicine or similar field.
You are available for a (minimal) period of 6 months.
You have a strong interest in computational simulations.
Knowledge of fluid dynamics is a plus.
Knowledge of computation simulation software (e.g. COMSOL) is a plus.
An interest in biomedical research is a plus.
Motivated student eager to expand knowledge in the field.
Good written and verbal English skills.
Entitled to do an internship in the Netherlands. This means that you are either an EU/EEA citizen, or a non-EU/EEA citizen who is studying at a Dutch university and need to do an internship as part of your studies.

Intern or Graduate Building Physics,"As an international student you have come to study in the Netherlands. But wouldn’t it be nice to experience the practice as well before your choose the topic of your Master thesis? Would you also like to discover what we do? We are happy to share our knowledge with you.
About DGMR
It is our conviction that people are most successful in a sustainable, safe and healthy environment. Every day we challenge ourselves to come up with creative solutions. Effective for society. Innovative for clients. Crucial to the comfortable living environment of today and tomorrow.
In 1980, engineers Van Dalfsen, Gies, Meerdink and Van Rangelrooij started a new and independent engineering and consultancy agency: DGMR. Because they wanted to connect quality to creativity. To seek out the boundaries of possibilities, off the beaten path. To think along with clients in order to surprise them with optimal and integrated solutions.
We provide advice on building physics, sustainability and fire safety for New Babylon in The Hague, the Timmerhuis in Rotterdam, Pulse in Delft, Naturalis in Leiden or the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. Valued advice in versatile and high-profile projects.
Next to projects we think that sharing and developing knowledge is really important to stay a frontrunner in our working field. We had quite a lot of interns and graduation students over the past fifteen years, both Dutch and international students, and they were all very happy at doing so. Subjects were for example climate adaptation, big data on NZEB buildings, parametric design of Active House, fire safety of car parks and biobased facades. We also joined the MOR team from TU Delft in 2019 as a coach on building physics.
We are looking for you
We are looking for inquisitive and enthusiastic students who are currently following HBO or TU Architecture, Civil Engineering, Building Physics, Mechanical Engineering, Climate & Management or equivalent. Do you have a passion for building physics & sustainability, facade technology or fire safety and affinity with both construction and installation technology, then we have various options for you.
More about this vacancy
What will you do in an Internship?
You participate in projects to discover what it means to work at a consultancy. You work on challenging projects together with a project manager. We ensure that you get to see as many aspects of the profession as possible and that you can perform as much as possible yourself. This includes carrying out inspections on the building, carrying out building physical or facade measurements (sound, infrared, airtightness) and calculations (thermal bridges, energy performance, daylight, room acoustics, ventilation), calculations for fire spread and clearance time, checking against the Building Decree, BREEAM, WELL or coming up with equivalences.

Personal quote

Before my internship in DGMR, I had some doubts about my future career. Through this internship, I have seen what elements of the Building Physics interest me the most and could be the future working options. This way I think I will contribute most to society and sustainability in the built environment.

What will you do for Graduate?
Together with the unit manager of the field in which you want to graduate, you determine a good research question. We always have a number of actuel topics that we would like to discuss with you, but we do think that is important that it fits you as well. You carry out a graduation project fairly independently, supervised by an experienced project leader and with around 250 collagues at hand with a lot of practical knowledge. You regularly meet with your supervisor and you discuss the progress of your research. In this way we keep a finger on the pulse and we can support you if necessary.
What do we offer you as an Intern or Graduate Building Physics?
A challenging internship or graduation research, which looks good on your CV.
An internship allowance.
Good guidance from our experienced colleagues.
You will work for an organization where you can be yourself. We value the diversity of our people and strive for an inclusive culture. Everyone should feel involved and valued, despite the differences in backgrounds and areas of focus. Simply because diversity leads to the best solutions.
An informal working atmosphere, with creative and passionate colleagues, where you are challenged and where you can grow.
A workplace where you quickly feel at home. The location from which you work can be our office in the dynamic center of The Hague, our office in the center of Arnhem or our sustainable and energy-efficient location in Drachten. The location where you will work depends on where you live. All locations are easily accessible by public transport.
Personal quote

Along with work, there is always room for fun, relaxing time, celebration, and sports. Start of every month DGMR has a company meeting. After that, everyone met in the cafeteria to have a piece of cake. During this time, people from different departments interact with each other, which is important for exchange of knowledge across departments. Every day there is a lunch walk around the city center where people share things about their personal life. Which differs greatly from my experience in India. I find this Dutch culture essential because it brings social aspects. People get to know each other, grow trust and friendship.
