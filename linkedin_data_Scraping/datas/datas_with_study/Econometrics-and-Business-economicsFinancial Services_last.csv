Senior Economic Consultant Scenarios and Asset Valuation,"Would you like to join a dynamic company that provides advisory services to a diverse, international client base comprised of pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, banks, and asset managers? Are you passionate about simplifying and solving complex problems, while delivering exceptional client service? Are you interested in building your consulting expertise in the exciting fields of economic scenarios and asset valuation? Do you stay up-to-date with global economic developments and financial news? If you answered yes to these questions, we invite you to consider joining us as our Senior Economic Consultant for Scenarios and Asset Valuation.
What do we have to offer?
As a senior economic consultant, our clients see you as their trusted advisor on our scenario-based risk and return expectations and their positioning against the current macroeconomic environment. The quantitative economic scenarios that you will be advising on are a crucial input in the financial decision making for many applications such as ALM, risk management, and financial planning. Example applications include analyzing exposure to which asset classes fits best with investment goals, and whether investment goals are attainable with the current strategic asset allocation.

As a project leader, you are responsible for the management of sales and client servicing projects. Examples are running trials of our scenarios for potential new clients, the onboarding and implementation of new clients, and projects that improve the services that we provide to our global client base, such as rolling out a new stress testing suite. In doing so, you have the opportunity develop yourself technically, economically, and financially, since our quantitative scenarios cover every asset class that typically is part of the portfolios of our global client base.
In your role, you coach other consultants and build relationships with key clients to work on a long-term partnership. This involves personal responsibility for one or more client accounts. You ensure that our clients are satisfied with the products and services that we provide. To do so, you will work closely with other consultants and our quantitative analysts to help our clients understand and use our quantitative economic scenarios as well as the software that our clients use to work with these.

We offer you plenty of room and autonomy to fully apply your talents and highly value an enterprising spirit. You will be given responsibilities immediately and you will be personally and actively mentored in the process.

The Scenarios and Asset Valuation Solution
You will be part of our Scenarios and Asset Valuation (SAV) Solution, which is a group of about 25 persons with an academic background. SAV is an innovative multidisciplinary group with Consultants, Quantitative Financial Analysts, and Quantitative Developers as well as Software Developers.

We provide both real-world and risk-neutral economic scenarios to enable our clients to manage the complexity of investment decision making. Our real-world scenarios provide risk and return projections that dynamically adjust to the latest economic and financial market circumstances. This includes the effects of ‘externalities’ such as central bank interventions or the Covid-19 pandemic and has a global coverage of asset classes for many different regions. We achieve this by integrating characteristics of realistic market behavior (“stylized facts”) into forward-looking asset prices, yield curves, and volatilities as well as into the broader macro-economic environment. Our risk-neutral scenarios enable actuaries and finance professionals to perform market-consistent valuations of optionality in insurance liabilities and of financial contingent claims more generally.
For a flavor of what we do, please refer to our introduction video, quarterly webinars or Insights.
What’s in it for you?
We offer you a challenging and rewarding role in a growing company, while being part of an inspirational global business with a lot of opportunities for personal and professional career development.

The salary range is € 77.000 - € 120.000 on a yearly basis (including variable pay, 13th month, holiday allowance), dependent on your role, competencies, and experience.

Unique and challenging position for a credit risk expert in on-site banking supervision at DNB.
Jij hebt impact
Make an impact!
Working at DNB, you will have direct impact on financial stability and sustainable prosperity. As a credit risk expert you help achieve these goals by participating in targeted on-site inspections at banks and providing expertise to colleagues.
You will supervise all aspects of the credit risk process, from origination to monitoring to provisioning, and for a wide range of assets; from mortgages and SME loans to complex corporate financing structures. Your expertise helps to ensure that banks are safe and sound and can continue to support households, businesses and projects through their lending. In other words, you will have a direct impact on society!
This is what you will be doing as a credit risk expert at DNB
You will conduct inspections on the set-up and practical effectiveness of credit risk management in specific portfolios of Dutch and international banks. You conduct these inspections on-site, at the banks’ premises, as well as in a more hybrid form.
Key issues that will require attention in the period ahead are the determination of provisioning in line with new international accounting standards (IFRS9), the increasing use of complex algorithms in credit models, and the impact of geopolitical challenges, inflationary pressures and climate risks on the quality of credit portfolios.
This is what your job involves:
Assessing the management of credit risks at banks during inspections based on interviews, quantitative risk analyses, policy reviews and individual credit files. You will share your observations with the relevant account supervisors and advise them on the appropriate supervisory strategy.
Conducting complex, in-depth quantitative analyses, contributing to benchmarking studies, developing analytical tooling and research methods, at DNB as well as in international working groups.
Advising DNB's account supervisors, SSM supervisors and DNB's Executive Board on credit risk-related matters and the necessary follow-up.
Sharing your knowledge and observations with your DNB and SSM colleagues, to improve the effectiveness of Dutch and European credit risk supervision.
Hier doe je dat
This is where you will be working
You will work in a team of 14 colleagues within the Credit Risk (CR) department. CR is part of the On-Site Supervision and Banking Expertise (OSBE) Division, which carries out inspections and supports other banking supervision divisions with its expertise. The OSBE Division employs around 100 committed professionals with various backgrounds and nationalities.
The inspections that you will be involved in are project-based. The project teams are of varying composition, comprising DNB colleagues and other supervisors within the European Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM).
DNB forms part of the SSM of the ECB and the national competent authorities of the 20 euro area countries. Working for the SSM means that you will have the opportunity to travel abroad for training, on-site inspections and other activities from time to time.
Dit breng je mee
What do we need from you?
At DNB you will work with other experts of a high professional standard. Against this background, we are looking for candidates with strong problem-solving and analytical skills and sharp judgment. Your analyses demonstrate a keen awareness of both current and emerging risks.
You have proven affinity with data and complex quantitative analyses. You enjoy a ‘hands-on’ approach towards challenging a bank’s reporting, models and risk assumptions.
You always remain critical, continue to ask questions and are able to hold your ground in difficult discussions.
You are able to articulate your observations and opinions in a clear, well-argumented and transparent manner.
You are excited to contribute to financial stability and sustainable prosperity.
Last but not least, you are a team player and you are willing to contribute to a positive working atmosphere in the department.

What other characteristics are we looking for?
You have a university Master's degree in econometrics, finance, risk management, business administration, accountancy or another field with a strong analytical and quantitative component.
You have at least 3-5 years of experience in credit risk management at a bank, supervisory authority or credit risk consultancy firm.
You have experience with the development or assessment of models, stress testing, statistical analysis, scenario planning and/or dashboard development. You are proficient with programming languages such as R and Python.
Prior experience with model-based (IRB/IFRS9/Stress testing) aspects of credit risk at a bank, supervisory authority or credit risk consultancy firm is considered a strong asset.
You have knowledge of relevant prudential laws and regulations, such as CRR/CRD and relevant EBA Guidelines. This includes the translation of credit risk into capital requirements.
You have excellent written and verbal communication skills in English and (willingness to learn) Dutch. A good command of one or more other European languages is considered an asset.
You have no objection to travelling to other SSM member states from time to time.

It provides realistic stochastic risk and return scenarios for all relevant time horizons and balance-sheet-level applications in a single calibration, bringing consistency and efficiency to enterprise-wide investment decision-making and risk management. Fueled by the ever-growing demand from our clients and regulators for clear (macro-economic) intuition and assumptions, the next generation OFS must be able to provide more intuition and to integrate climate change, while keeping the OFS’s unique strengths such as scalability and its frequency domain approach.The development of the next generation OFS is a challenging task and requires research for multiple years. In the first year, you get to develop a multi-year research program, containing measurable deliverables and be validated with a few clients. To support the development of this research program, you should lay the necessary fundament in the first year, by understanding the OFS model set-up, the use cases of our clients, and figuring out when clients find the additional intuitiveness of the model sufficient for their purposes. If time allows, a first topic could already be explored in the first year if the research program is ready quickly. Given the applied nature of this research and the focus on generating client-ready innovations, writing publications will not be part of the plan or research goals.

The real-world economic scenario generator is the Ortec Finance Scenario set (OFS) which provides the valuations and risks of various asset classes in the present and future. The OFS creates real-world stochastic scenarios with a worldwide asset class coverage and provides the financial risk and return expectations for more than 600 risk-drivers for a short-, medium- and long-term horizon. The OFS is calibrated and analyzed with our Dynamic Scenario Generator (DSG) software. The risk-neutral economic scenario generator (RN-scenarios) enables actuaries and finance professionals to perform market-consistent valuations of optionality in insurance liabilities and of financial contingent claims more generally. The OFS, DSG and RN-scenarios are a cornerstone in the advisory services Ortec Finance provides to its clients and serves as a crucial input in the financial decision making for applications such as ALM and risk management for pension funds, insurance companies, asset managers, sovereign wealth funds and private wealth management all over the world.
