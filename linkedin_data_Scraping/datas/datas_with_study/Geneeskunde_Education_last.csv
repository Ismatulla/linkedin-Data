At the Athena Institute of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam we invite applications for a full-time permanent appointment as assistant professor in Transdisciplinary Science & Technology Studies, specializing in material approaches for transformation.


LOCATION: Amsterdam

FTE: 1

Job description
Within STS there is increasing attention for transdisciplinary scholarship that explores new forms of knowledge production, expression, and travel in relation to technoscience. This development happens under several related headings, such as STS Making & Doing, Situated Intervention, Material Participation and Experimental Collaborations. These approaches share that scholars adopt active roles in the co-shaping of knowledge practices and technologies. Scholarship in this domain requires entwining normative commitments with experimental, co-constructive theory-method packages that extend beyond discursive interventions.


Your duties

In this position you need to empirically study and experimentally shape practices of technology development and/or knowledge production. Your research approach should primarily be experimental and collaborative, with the aim of addressing societal challenges regarding participation in science and technology, broadly defined. Your profile should display specific attention to questions of equity. Research at the Athena Institute includes approaches such as STS Making & Doing; Interactive Learning and Action; Reflexive monitoring in action (RMA); and Situated Intervention, that share that issue-articulation and the exploration of solutions are developed in collaboration with a wide range of actors/stakeholders. Although there are no specific requirements regarding topical areas of specialization, candidates need to relate their work to the five research themes of the Athena Institute; Emerging science and technology; (Global) health and well-being; Nature, agriculture and environment; Competency development in inter- and transdisciplinary research; and History of knowledge. The successful candidate is expected to collaborate with different colleagues in projects across these research themes.
Requirements
A completed PhD in science, technology & society studies, participatory design, innovation studies, or a related (inter)discipline; an additional background in the sciences is a plus;
Proven experience with experimental methods for the transdisciplinary study of public issues/challenges;
Experience with participatory research methods that co-shape technologies and knowledge practices to address societal challenges in an equitable way;
Proven ability to be a strong collaborator within interdisciplinary teams (listening, flexible, adaptive, pro-active);
Strong and relevant publication track-record, commensurate with the candidate’s career stage and complementing and extending the Athena Institute’s research portfolio;
Experience with applying for research grants and externally funded projects and ability to meet deadlines and produce deliverables;
Excellent teaching skills and the ability to inspire students (demonstrated through a.o. positive student evaluations);
A teaching qualification (in Dutch BKO);
An (inter)national network relevant to the position;
Good command of Dutch (preferred) and excellent command of English.
Faculty criteria for appointment at the level of assistant professor are available upon request but minimally include having completed a PhD and having approximately 10 international peer reviewed publications.


Given the extensive collaboration with both international as well as Dutch partners, a good command of Dutch language is required for the position. Since this appointment is intended to result in a tenured position, strong candidates who can convincingly argue that they will be able to master a good working level of Dutch in a relatively short period of time (e.g. through having lived/worked/studied in the Netherlands or having mastered a similar foreign language before) are welcome to apply.
What are we offering?
A challenging career track position from Assistant Professor 2 to Assistant Professor 1 in a socially involved organization. On full-time basis the remuneration amounts to a minimum gross monthly salary of €3,974 (scale 11) and a maximum €5,439 (scale 11), depending on your education and experience. The job profile: Assistant Professor 2 is based on the university job ranking system and is vacant for at least 0.8 FTE.


We offer 2 types of contracts. For candidates already living in the Netherlands, we offer a permanent position after 18 months, after a successful evaluation in your 15th month. After a successful evaluation, a path will be outlined for future academic development.

To candidates that will relocate from abroad we offer a second option next to the previous one. This will be a first (temporary) contract for the duration of 6 years. After 2 and 4 years the performance will be evaluated in terms of teaching, publication record, and acquisition of project funding (in addition to the annual assessment with your supervisor). After a successful evaluation permanent employment will be granted after 6 years and a path will be outlined for future academic development.

PhD vacancy: Network communication platform for transmural care teams,"About the project
Care for chronic patients, for instance vulnerable elderly patients, diabetes patients or orthopaedic patients, is provided by multiple care teams working for different care organisations, e.g. hospitals, general practice and long term community care services. Each of these care domains not only has its own organisational structure, but also its own information infrastructure. This makes it hard to communicate information to obtain a complete picture of the patient situation when care needs to be provided by displaced teams.
In the Amsterdam region a network communication platform is currently implemented to support transmural teamwork. The purpose of this project is to further develop, test and implement a digital network communication platform to support transmural care provided by care teams, consisting of professionals in primary and secondary care, the patient and his/her informal care givers.

About the role
To achieve the goals of this project we will: (1) Investigate the needs, values, facilitators and barriers of stakeholders involved; (2) Explore specific contextual challenges for transmural team functioning and identify specific design opportunities using human-centered design research techniques (i.e. a sociotechnical system perspective including stakeholder mapping, context mapping and patient journey mapping); (3) Iteratively design (extensions of) the information integration platform with support for transmural teams; (4) Identify and understand cross-national differences in contextual challenges and use of transmural support tools for transmural care teams; and (5) Evaluate the impact of a tailored integration information platform to support transmural care teams.
The studies will result in a review of contextual challenges and information needs of transmural care teams, a tailored information integration platform to support transmural care teams and guidance for end-users and policy makers.

Profile
You should have:
an undergraduate degree in medicine, design, human factors, psychology or health sciences;
hold, or nearing completion of, a Masters degree in medicine, design, psychology or health sciences;
evidence of experience in quantitative and qualitative research methods;
prior paid or voluntary work experience;
evidence of excellent communication and organisational skills; and
prior experience in conducting implementation research in health care would also be an advantage.

"Junior scientist (post-doc) in cellular neuroscience (cell biology, life cell imaging) for four years* (1.0fte)","Project: Mechanisms of neuropeptide trafficking and secretion in human and mouse neurons


Location : Amsterdam

FTE: 0,8 -1
Job description
Neuropeptides are by far the largest group of chemical signals in the brain, playing a vital role in a wide range of brain functions, from sleep to cognition. Yet, the way these signals are produced, packaged, transported, and secreted by brain cells is still poorly understood. Furthermore, dysregulation of neuropeptide signalling is implicated in numerous brain disorders (e.g., autism, mental retardation) and neuropeptides are used treatment for many of these, including epilepsy. Neurons secrete neuropeptides from dense core vesicles (DCVs) and the aim of this project is to unravel the mechanisms of DCV trafficking and secretion in neurons with a specific focus on the initial stages of this secretory pathway. This project uses life cell imaging (2-photon and confocal microscopy) in human iPSC-derived neurons and intact rodent tissue (brain slices, in vivo), and genetically encoded reporters to detect DCV trafficking and fusion. We have previously established detection of DCV secretion in neurons with single vesicle resolution and characterized several molecular factors that regulate secretion. In this project we will exploit these tools and methods to gain deeper understanding of the secretory pathway and its dysregulation in disease.

You will be part of international research networks and exploit a variety of other analysis tools available here. You will be appointed in Amsterdam and work primarily in Amsterdam with regular visits to the other labs. All the necessary methodology, equipment, analysis software, viral vectors, and mutant iPSCs and mice will be available from the start of the project.

Morerover, the research environment in Amsterdam and the strong international collaborations provide excellent opportunities for professional growth, with the work in this project serving as a springboard to establish an independent research team and pursue an independent scientific career
Requirements
We are looking for scientists with the following qualifications
a successful PhD in biomedical sciences or biophysics with neuroscience specialization
hand-on experience with molecular/cellular neuroscience, especially the methods listed above
hands-on experience with bioinformatics is an advantage
a strong motivation to pursue a career in science.
What are we offering?
A challenging position in a socially involved organization.

The job profile: is based on the university job ranking system and is vacant for 1.0 FTE.

The appointment will initially be for 1 year. After a satisfactory evaluation of the initial appointment, the contract will be extended for another 3 years.

Additionally, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam offers excellent fringe benefits and various schemes and regulations to promote a good work/life balance, such as
8% holiday allowance and 8.3% end-of-year bonus
contribution to commuting expenses
optional model for designing a personalized benefits package
