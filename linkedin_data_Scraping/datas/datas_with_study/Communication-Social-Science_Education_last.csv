How does a waiter at a restaurant know what we mean when we point to an empty glass, and how did we learn to select that particular gesture? As a research assistant, you will help organise a longitudinal study in pre-school children to help understand human communication and how it develops.

This project builds on the notion that social experiences early in life are crucial for the development of human communication skills. The project uses natural variability in early life social experiences as a tool to understand how different sociocultural environments guide the development of human communicative capacities. We plan to test long-lasting effects of those experiences on the human ability to communicate. The specific goal of the project is to identify which features of children's sociocultural environment influence their ability to coordinate with other people later in development. We are looking for a MSc interested in organising an ambitious real-life longitudinal study involving pre-school children. The study will use wearable audio-recording devices to measure the interactions of 3- to 4-year-old children during their time in day care (e.g. over the course of a week). The project is embedded in the research groups of Prof. Ivan Toni, Prof. Sabine Hunnius, and Dr Marlene Meyer at the Donders Institute, combining expertise in social neurocognition, experimental semiotics, and developmental neurocognition.
Profile
You have an MSc degree in psychology, educational sciences, or (cognitive) neuroscience, with hands-on experience in experimental testing of young children.
Fluency in written/spoken Dutch is required.
Given the interdisciplinary of the research setting, you should have a strong collaborative attitude and a proven ability to work in a team.
You will be responsible for planning and implementing a project quantifying children's interactions in a naturalistic setting. The position also involves supervision of a dedicated student assistant.
You will take the lead in coordinating the implementation of the research project in collaboration with the PIs.
The Donders Institute values a diverse workforce. Female candidates are therefore particularly encouraged to apply.

Join the Amsterdam Business School at the University of Amsterdam (UvA) to shape the future of entrepreneurship research. We are seeking to nurture an ambitious and enthusiastic PhD candidate that will join our Entrepreneurship and Innovation section on September 1st, 2023.

Project description

“There’s an essential, intangible something in start-ups—an energy, a soul. Company founders sense its presence. So do early employees and customers. It inspires people to contribute their talent, money, and enthusiasm and fosters a sense of deep connection and mutual purpose.”
(Gulati, R. 2019. The Soul of a Start-Up. Harvard Business Review)

Startups must obtain resources from a variety of stakeholders. This project is built around the idea that these stakeholders, including customers, employees, investors, and society at large, associate a unique and distinguishable character with organizations operating under the label “startup” (with variations including “tech startup”, “AI startup”, “scaleup”, “unicorn”, etc.). This is important because organizations, just like individuals, may either enjoy or suffer the consequences of being associated with certain labels and stereotypes. Regardless of other relevant considerations, simply being called a ""startup” can therefore be linked with both positive and negative social evaluations. For example, cultural messages about startups associate these organizations with innovation, visionary leaders, and the underdog drive to disrupt industries. At the same time, however, startups may also and receive harsher judgments due to uncertainty about their underlying quality and potential or doubts about their legitimacy and credibility. This project aims to unpack the conditions under which the meaning associated with startup-related labels emerges and how such labels might independently shape evaluations and resource provision by different stakeholders. Answering such questions is crucial not only because it will contribute to theories of social evaluations in entrepreneurship and management, but also because the current hype around startups demands a better understanding of the power encapsulated in such labels, acknowledging their increasing strategic use (e.g., for competitive differentiation or persuasive stakeholder communication) and misuse (e.g., for stakeholder deception and other ethical lapses).

Key questions include:
What are the set of meanings and expectations that different stakeholder groups associate with the startup label?
how does the startup label shape interactions between entrepreneurs and different stakeholder groups, including resource acquisition from stakeholders?
what are the implications of combining or replacing the startup label with other relevant labels (e.g., AI startup, unicorn, scaleup, etc.)?

Example sub-projects include:
An exploration of the set of meanings and expectations implied by the startup label as well as the likelihood that this label is associated with different combinations of observed organizational attributes (e.g., location, size, age, demographic composition, growth stage, funding stage, industry sector, business model, etc.);
looking into whether and how the startup label is used strategically by entrepreneurs when interacting with different stakeholder groups (e.g., job seekers vs. investors vs. customers vs. the wider public) or under different conditions (e.g., different countries and ecosystems or under varying economic climates), including the potential “dark side” of the startup label (e.g., when used for stakeholder deception or when it deters some people from engaging with the company);
testing how the startup label interacts with other prominent labels (tech startups vs. AI startup vs. medical device startups) and the extent to which such combinatorial labels lead to different outcomes;
assessing the reasons and implications of discarding the startup label (e.g., when transitioning from startup to scaleup)?

During your PhD, you will be trained to conduct primarily quantitative empirical research aimed at advancing entrepreneurship research in top-tier academic journals. You will also be an active member of a research lab focused on the study of startups. As a member of this lab within the Entrepreneurship and Innovation section, you will benefit from, and contribute to a broader research agenda, networks, initiatives, resources, and input from a larger group of experienced researchers.

Your tasks
Become a member of a collaborative team;
co-planning and conducting research (including the design of the studies, and the collection and analysis of empirical data);

present research findings at leading international conferences;
attend classes and seminars (including those offered at other universities) to further develop thinking and research skills;
participate in and contribute to research activities at the section and lab (e.g., research seminars and research meetings);
assist in relevant teaching and knowledge dissemination activities.

Expected outcome
At least 3 manuscripts ready for submission to or already published in top academic journals (adequate collegial support and mentorship will be provided);
placement at a research university in a tenure track position;
continued collaboration with the lab and its members.

Requirements

Master’s degree in business administration/management, economics, psychology, sociology, or a related discipline (expected to finish by September 2023);
preference will be given to candidates with research masters;

inquisitive nature, next to a drive to increase your knowledge and a passion for research;
people skills to work in a team, openness to collaborate with others and to contribute to the functioning of our lab.

Our offer

The compensation package is competitive at the European level and includes several secondary benefits. Favorable tax agreements may apply to non-Dutch applicants. and uva.nl/working-at-eb.

PhD researcher in Criminal Procedure Law and AI for intelligence analysis,"Do you want to study one of the core legal and regulatory issues relating to the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for intelligence analysis in criminal investigations? And do you want to contribute to a vision on how to regulate such AI through criminal procedure law and technology?


Location: AMSTERDAM

FTE: 1 - 1
Job description
This PhD position on Criminal Procedure Law and AI for intelligence analysis at the Criminal Law group of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam is part of an interdisciplinary research project ‘AI4Intelligence’. You will join an exciting and vibrant community where legal scholars, computer scientists and public administration experts meet and form interdisciplinary teams that work at the intersection of Criminal Procedure Law and Technology.


Your duties

What are you going to do?
The main goal of using AI for intelligence analysis is to produce evidence that can be used in criminal cases in court. However, in order to translate AI-generated information into admissible court evidence it must comply with the general evidentiary requirements of reliability and lawfulness. There are two interrelated reasons that make satisfying these requirements difficult. First, there is a lack of (clear) rules as to how the evidentiary requirements – developed for analogue situations with different types of evidence in mind – are to be operationalised in the context of AI in the criminal process. And, second, AI diminishes the transparency and explainability of the evidence-creation process. The resulting effect reduces the possibility of the judge and the defence to question and contest AI-generated evidence (i.e., ‘contestability’). The end result is that neither the judge nor the defence can properly assess whether the content of the information is truthful and has been obtained through legal methods. The lack of contestability of AI-generated evidence therefore has a significant effect on one of the core rights and principles of the criminal process: the right to a fair trial and the accompanying principle of equality of arms.


Building on existing work on AI-regulation, due process and digital evidence, this PhD will engage with the following questions. What enables the contestability of AI-produced evidence in court? How could and should requirements of transparency and explainability (as stemming from the right to a fair criminal trial) be understood in the context of AI-generated evidence and its ‘black box’ nature? To what extent can the requirements of transparency and explainability be ‘hardcoded’ in AI-tools themselves? And can a ‘dialogue-based’ approach to explainability via symbolic-AI and interactive visualisation techniques, which allow for the inclusion of contextual knowledge, mitigate issues relating to the trouble with hardcoding complex legal rules?


The PhD is a part of an NWO-funded interdisciplinary research project (‘AI4Intelligence’), which enables close collaboration with the Department of Information and Computing Sciences and the School of Governance at Utrecht University, and the Visual Analytics group (Department of Mathematics and Computer Science) at Technical University Eindhoven. Through close collaboration with researchers in law, computer science, visual analytics and public administration, you will conduct cutting-edge interdisciplinary research into the regulation of AI for intelligence analysis. With your interdisciplinary collaborative work you will be able to translate research results into innovation and influence policymaking in the Netherlands.
Requirements
a completed master’s degree in law; knowledge of Dutch criminal law is a plus;
affinity with questions of criminal law and technology and a knowledgeable curiosity for AI;
excellent academic credentials, as demonstrated by grades and/or curriculum vitae;
a creative mind and strong critical and analytical skills;
an interest in working across legal disciplines, using different methods (e.g., interdisciplinary and empirical) and collaborations with non-legal disciplines;
an excellent command of English; knowledge of Dutch is a plus.
If the vacancy appeals to you, but you are doubting whether you are THE person we are looking for, please do apply. We welcome applications from underrepresented backgrounds.

What are we offering?
We offer a temporary full-time contract with the preferred starting date on 1 June 2023. The appointment will initially be for 1 year. After a satisfactory evaluation of the initial appointment, the contract will be extended for a total duration of 3 years.
The salary will be in accordance with university regulations for academic personnel and amounts €2,541 (PhD) per month during the first year and increases to €3,247 (PhD) per month during the fourth year, based on a full-time contract. Additionally, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam offers excellent fringe benefits and various schemes and regulations to promote a good work/life balance, such as:
a maximum of 41 days of annual leave based on full-time employment;

PhD Artificial intelligence for tracking the politics of climate change adaptation,"A highly motivated PhD student on the interface of artificial intelligence and climate action.

Keen to further develop artificial intelligence approaches to enhance climate action? Always wondered why governments are typically reluctant to track their implementation of climate action? Curious about the political dynamics that shape how governments around the globe are (not) adapting to climate change? Then this PhD project on using artificial intelligence methods for analyzing the politics of tracking climate change adaptation could be a great fit!


This PhD position is part of the NWO-VIDI project led by Dr. Robbert Biesbroek (Public Administration and Policy group) entitled “High ambitions, (s)low implementation? The politics of tracking adaptation to climate change (2023-2027).

Background of the program: Adapting to the impacts of climate change is necessary and increasingly urgent. Governments across the globe have increasingly formulated high adaptation ambitions to become more climate resilient. In order to understand if these ambitions are implemented in practice, tracking progress on adaptation is of critical importance. This program aims to develop, theorize and empirically test the causes and consequences of the politics of adaptation tracking. Adopting a comparative approach, the program investigates the political dynamics around the Global Stocktake under the UNFCCC Paris Agreement, the EU Climate Change Adaptation Strategy, and ongoing climate change adaptation developments in several countries from across the globe. In the program mixed methods are used, combining traditional methods of expert interviews, observations and focus group discussions, with machine learning and quantitative text analysis to analyze the politics of adaptation tracking.
The program takes a solutions-oriented perspective by co-designing politically sensitive intervention pathways with practitioners. It provides concrete evidence-based insights where and how to intervene in policy processes in order to accelerate the design and execution of adequate and effective frameworks on adaptation tracking.

There are two PhD positions in this NWO-VIDI program. The position in this call will focus on using Artificial Intelligence methods to track the politics of tracking climate change adaptation. The other PhD position will focus on conceptualizing and empirically investigating the politics of adaptation tracking using a primarily a qualitative approach.

For this PhD position “Artificial intelligence for tracking the politics of climate change adaptation”, you will:
Employ state-of-the art machine learning tools to develop evidence maps on what is already known about the politics of tracking policy for climate and other sustainability challenges
Develop and apply natural language processing methods to analyze the politics of tracking adaptation to climate change from a variety of sources (media, policy documents, minutes, speeches, etc.) at national and global levels
Co-organize and participate in workshops on the politics of adaptation tracking
Lead the development of 4 scientific publications which form the basis of your PhD dissertation. You will also be involved in developing program-level publications (as co-author)
Present your work at (inter)national scientific conferences and/or symposia
In addition to the other PhD candidate in this program, you will collaborate in Dr. Biesbroek’s research lab with ~10 other postdocs, PhD candidates, and research assistants working on climate change related topics. For this project you will also collaborate with Prof. Dr. Ioannis Athanasiadis (Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, Wageningen University) who will act as the second promotor in this PhD project.
The selected candidate preferably starts June-August 2023. Wageningen University & Research offers excellent terms of employment. A few highlights from our Collective Labour Agreement include:
sabbatical leave, study leave, and partially paid parental leave;
working hours that can be discussed and arranged so that they allow for the best possible work-life balance;

Are you interested in studying networks and using methodology at the cross-section of business analytics, econometrics and computer science? The Business Analytics section at the University of Amsterdam Business School invites applications for a PhD position in Network Statistics and Machine Learning. We are looking for candidates with the ambition to work and succeed at the highest international academic level.

The main topic of research is network analysis and modelling using statistical and machine learning tools. Network data are ubiquitous in finance, social media, the economy, and business. Social networks play an increasingly important role in society. For example, the Reddit community WallStreetBets hyped the stock of GameStop (GME), causing a short squeeze and extremely volatile stock prices in early 2021. Similarly, statements made on social networks such as Twitter have been shown to impact public and voter opinions. Exemplifying how social networks directly affect the economy, this project focusses on studying network data with a specific interest in modelling and understanding how networks change over time. Change detection in an online fashion is a challenging task in networks of large size, a common property of social networks.

In this research, the candidate will first investigate and develop interpretable network analysis approaches using statistical models and test them on real-life data. Then geometric deep learning approaches for the tasks like node classification, link prediction and graph classification will be developed with change detection ability. In the final phase of the project, the candidate should bring together two families of methods and design an optimized algorithm that is both interpretable and yields a high performance in network change detection.

The PhD student will work in close collaboration with the supervisory team and other faculty on the tasks.
The supervisory team will consist of dr. Inez Zwetsloot (ABS), dr. Simon Trimborn (ASE) and dr. Stevan Rudinac (ABS).

What are you going to do?

Develop novel interpretable statistical models for network analysis;
develop novel deep-learning approaches for node classification, link prediction, and community detection in network data;
create open data and software tools for the envisioned network analysis tasks;
present research findings at international conferences;
write up findings for publication in international journals;
pursue and complete a PhD thesis within the appointed duration of four years;
attend classes and seminars (including those offered at other universities) to develop thinking and research skills further;
participate in and contribute to departmental research functions (PhD Day, research seminars, and research meetings);
assist in knowledge dissemination activities;
participate in teaching-related activities (to a limited degree), including undergraduate tutorials and the supervision of MSc and/or BSc thesis projects.

What do we require?

Formal requirements:
Masters’ degree in Statistics, Econometrics, Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Mathematics, or a related field (expected to finish by September 2023)

excellent programming skills in one or more of the following languages: Python, R, C, C++;
preferably experience with at least one of the following: network data analysis, deep learning libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow, timeseries modeling and prediction, high-performance computing.3

Additional requirements:
Preference is given to candidates with some research experience (e.g., Master thesis and/or research assistant experience);
strong commitment to methodological rigor and scientific integrity;
energy and passion for statistics and machine learning;
intellectual curiosity, eagerness to learn, and openness to criticism;
willingness to participate in disseminating research results and valorization.

Our offer

The employment contract will be for four years with an initial period of 18 months, with an intermediate evaluation after 18 months and a possibility to extend it for 30 months (in total, four years). End-result should be a PhD thesis. An educational plan will be drafted that includes attendance of courses and (international) conferences. Preferred starting date is 1 September 2023.

Challenge: vulnerability of current health systems to disruptions
Change: designing health systems from a multi-actor systems perspective
Impact: more resilient health systems
Job description
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted vulnerabilities within health(care) systems worldwide. The cascading impacts of workforce unavailability, the disruptions of critical supply chains, and the overburdening of emergency services combined with poor coordination and inadequate governance, led to lasting disruptions with severe impacts for society and economy. While this was an example of an acute external shock to the healthcare system, it exposed the realities in the everyday functioning of health systems globally struggling to meet care demands, which could have repercussions for future shocks and/or disasters. Future stressors such as accumulating effects of financial constraints and burned-out workforce could result in worse outcomes.

Following COVID-19, the World Health Organisation (WHO) made policy recommendations for increasing health systems resilience and pointed to the importance of addressing resilience in all aspects of the healthcare system, including transforming ‘obsolete’ practices and re-designing policies, protocols and services. Such system and institutional changes require design methods which take into account the complex multi-stakeholder environment.

We are seeking candidates whose research will focus on analysing and designing methods to make health systems better able to deal with internal and external disruptions, thereby contributing towards the resilience of health systems globally. In line with the faculty’s ethos, we seek candidates that can demonstrate how their research addresses the sociotechnical characteristics of health systems, and/or the associated challenges this may bring. This includes, but is not limited to, the multi-actor environments in which decisions about clinical care take place, the complex policy implications and decisions for delivering care, the ethical implications of health data and privacy, among many others.

Prospective candidates should demonstrate the core methodological contribution they would make to our Policy Analysis section. Areas of methodological expertise of the section’s staff members range from social-constructivist approaches to formal methods to support multi-actor systems analysis and design, such as participatory interventions, co-design methods, problem structuring, serious gaming, monitoring and evaluation, scenarios and visioning, adaptive planning, modelling and simulation, and data analytics.

Candidates should explicitly state in their application what anticipated methodological contributions they bring, and how they see themselves fitting within the existing strengths in our team. These can include a range of quantitative, modelling, simulation techniques, or qualitative, participatory methods. Experience or willingness to work with a mixed methods approach is particularly welcome.

Following the new multi-annual strategy 2022-2025, ‘health’ is now a core domain focus for our faculty. The candidate will be joining an existing community of researchers and educators bringing innovative and scientific breakthroughs to solving the complex socio-technical challenges within health systems. Researchers in our faculty work in close collaboration with Erasmus University Rotterdam, Erasmus Medical Centre, Leiden University Medical Centre, as well as joint institutes with Erasmus University such as the Pandemic & Disaster Preparedness Centre. Our ambition is to continue to grow this community by appointing new staff members dedicated to applying their skills to this domain, while also supporting cross-domain knowledge exchange with the rest of the faculty, in areas such as energy, transport, and climate. .

The Context

The Computer Science department of the University of Twente is expanding. Therefore, we are hiring 6 new faculty members, to strengthen our research in Artificial Intelligence, Cyberphysical systems and Software Engineering in the domains of (1) e-Health and (2) energy and sustainability. These new faculty members will be assigned in different research groups, but inter-group collaboration with other researchers working on these themes is considered essential to reach our overall ambitions. One of the six positions is in the Human Media Interaction (HMI) group and focusses on research in e-Health.


The Position

Research into multimodal conversational systems such as chatbots, virtual humans, or social robots to coach people to live a healthier lifestyle, both from a physical and mental perspective, has seen a steady growth in the past couple of years. With the introduction of conversational systems such as ChatGPT and Bard, it looks as if smooth natural language conversations with an AI system have become possible. However, lifestyle coaching systems need a more sensitive and controlled mechanism to decide on what personalized advice to give. They need to be sensitive to the possibly vulnerable physical and mental state of the user and be aware of the possible effects of their advice. Furthermore, the information they provide should be communicated in a convincing way, but also be reliable and trustworthy. We are looking for a candidate with an AI background that can contribute to intelligent systems that can realise these goals.

Human Media Interaction (HMI) is a diverse and interdisciplinary research group that studies and designs interactive systems that users can intuitively interact with, ranging from Brain Computer Interfaces to Conversational Systems and Ambient Intelligence applications. In the area of Conversational Systems, HMI has expertise on speech technology, dialogue systems, embodied conversational agents and social robots. On the theme of e-Health, HMI has a strong tradition in contributing to a variety of coaching systems such as applications to increase physical fitness, advice on particular conditions (asthma, diabetes), or helping people to stop smoking or drinking. Research is conducted in coalitions with other research groups from inside and outside the University of Twente and with external stakeholders such as hospitals, rehabilitation centers, elderly homes, etcetera.

Your profile
You have a strong interest and have shown ability to collaborate in an academic, multidisciplinary environment;
You have a PhD degree in Computer Science, or related discipline with a focus on relevant areas in Artificial Intelligence;
You have demonstrated the ability to perform high-quality research in one of the fields relevant to the topic: natural language processing, dialogue systems, virtual humans, or social robots;
You have shown a willingness to acquire external funding and are prepared to expand your skills in this respect;
You have good communication skills and are a team player;
You are fluent in English (knowledge of, or willingness to learn Dutch is an advantage);
You have a University Teaching Qualification (Dutch: BKO) or equivalent or you are willing to acquire one within three years.
Our offer
We offer a permanent position with a one-year probationary period (formally a 1-year contract with prospect of permanent contract).
The position comes with a start-up package that will be allow you to appoint one PhD student.
Our terms of employment are in accordance with the Dutch Collective Labor Agreement for Universities (CAO) and include a holiday allowance of 8% of the gross annual salary and a year-end bonus of 8.3%.
Depending on your relevant background and experience, the gross monthly salary on a full-time basis ranges from € 3974,- (scale 11) to € 6181,- (scale 12) gross per month.
A minimum of 29 leave days in case of full-time employment based on a formal workweek of 38 hours. A fulltime employment in practice means 40 hours a week, therefore resulting in 96 extra leave hours on an annual basis.
A solid pension scheme.
Free access to sport facilities on campus.
We are a family-friendly institution, which offers parental leave for both parents (both paid and unpaid) and career support for partners.
We appreciate diversity of profiles, cultures, and backgrounds, and promote an inclusive working culture.

Fully-funded PhD position in History of 20th-Century Philosophy (of Science),"Tilburg University | Tilburg School of Humanities and Digital Sciences Fully-funded PhD position in History of 20th-Century Philosophy (of Science) - ERC Project “Exiled Empiricists”

Department : Department of Philosophy
Location : Tilburg
Full time equivalent : 0,8 – 1,0 fte (32-40 hours per week)
Monthly full-time salary : € 2.541
Duration of employment contract : 1 year with an extension of 3 years (based on 1,0 fte)

The Department of Philosophy at Tilburg University seeks to appoint a PhD-researcher (4 or 5 years, 0,8 - 1,0 FTE) in the ERC StG/NWO Vidi project “Exiled Empiricists: American Philosophy and the Great Intellectual Migration”. Starting date: September 2023.

Job description
The candidate’s primary responsibility will be to write a dissertation and/or a series of academic papers on the institutional reception of refugee philosophers in the United States in the 1930s (working package B3 of the ERC research project, description below). They will study the records of American philosophy departments, journals and/or funding agencies and examine the processes that contributed to the successful (or unsuccessful) integration of different groups of philosophers. The researcher should also contribute to the project in other ways, such as attending the project meetings, giving conference presentations, and (co-)organizing reading groups and workshops. Furthermore, the candidate will be involved in teaching courses in our BA program and/or non-philosophy Bachelor programs (up to 10% of total task allocation) and will be a member of the Tilburg Center for Moral Philosophy, Epistemology and Philosophy of Science (TiLPS) and contribute to its colloquia and seminars.

The project
Exiled Empiricists: American Philosophy and the Great Intellectual Migration
The Exiled Empiricists project is funded by the European Research Council (ERC) and the Dutch Research Council (NWO) and led by Sander Verhaegh within the Tilburg Center for Moral Philosophy, Epistemology and Philosophy of Science (TiLPS), Tilburg University. The project currently employs three postdocs, a research assistant, and an external Ph.D. member.

Summary: In the 1930s, hundreds of European academics fled to the United States, escaping the quickly deteriorating political situation on the continent. Among them were a few dozen philosophers from a variety of schools: logical empiricists, critical theorists, and phenomenologists. Especially the first group would have a tremendous impact on American philosophy. Whereas the local intellectual climate had been dictated by American traditions like pragmatism, U.S. philosophers soon began to advance views that were heavily indebted to the empiricists. In fact, much of academic philosophy today is still shaped by the discussions and practices first instigated in this disruptive period.

Although historians have reconstructed the fate of the exiled empiricists, little attention has been paid to the American context in which their movement came to full bloom. This is surprising, since any account of the empiricists’ success requires an explanation of why the Americans were so receptive to their views. To what extent did developments in American philosophy pave the way for logical empiricism? And why was the American community more receptive to empiricism than to critical theory or phenomenology? This project shifts the perspective from the refugees to the local philosophical climate by 1) quantitatively analyzing thousands of American journal publications and 2) qualitatively examining the archives of dozens of key American philosophers and institutions.

A more detailed description of the project, including working package B3 (to which the PhD candidate will contribute), can be found on the project website.

Requirements position

PhD position in the field of Coronavirus replication and transcription investigation using single-molecule biophysics,"The Dulin lab has to offer one NWO funded PhD position (4 years) to start as soon as possible in the field of single-molecule biophysics to SARS-CoV-2 replication-transcription regulation. Please apply at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.


Location: AMSTERDAM

FTE: 0.8 - 1
Job description
The successful candidates will investigate how replication and transcription in coronaviruses are regulated by viral proteins associating with the polymerase and the viral genome sequence. To this end, she/he will use state-of-the-art single molecule techniques. Within the lab, the successful candidate will design, perform experiments, and develop new computational analysis tools to analyze her/his data.


Topic

The recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has shown how fragile humankind is when facing such highly infectious virus in absence of antiviral treatment. To establish a successful infection, SARS-CoV-2 must replicate and transcribe its genome very efficiently in the host cell. This task is performed by the replication-transcription complex, a multi-proteins complex formed of a polymerase and viral co-factors, which is a key target for antivirals. While cryo-electron microscopy has brought many high-resolution images of the complex in different compositions, functional studies are still lacking, impairing the precise characterization of the function of such complex during infection. The goal of this thesis is to decipher the mechanism of assembly of the replication-transcription complex and its regulation during viral RNA synthesis, providing new targets for the rational design of the antiviral drugs of the future.
Requirements
We are seeking for
An outstanding experimentalist with experience in physics of life, enzymology, biotechnology, soft matter physics. Candidates must have a MSc.degree. Experience in optics, computer programming (LabVIEW, Python, Matlab, C++, etc.) and enzymology will be strongly appreciated.

a creative, hard-working and independent individual with strong work ethic and interest in crossing research fields, and a strong ability to work in team.
The candidate will successfully develop and combine different expertise in physics, biology and software programming to establish new single-molecule assays and investigate how the coronavirus RNA synthesis machinery assembles and is regulated during viral RNA replication and transcription. Proficiency in English (both speaking and writing) is required.
What are we offering?
A challenging position in a socially involved organization. The salary will be in accordance with university regulations for academic personnel and amounts €2,541 (PhD) per month during the first year and increases to €3,247 (PhD) per month during the fourth year, based on a full-time employment.

Job description
In this PhD project, we draw inspiration from today’s overheated markets to study novel integrated energy market designs. We focus on the redesign of electricity, natural gas and hydrogen markets, ensuring they are fit for a net-zero world dominated by near zero-marginal cost variable renewable energy sources. This requires developing efficient, integrated market designs, providing the required price signals for an efficient operation of and investment in our energy systems, across energy vectors. At the same time, they should allow consumers and producers to hedge and share their financial risk, providing resiliency with respect to shocks.

Possible research questions central to this PhD project include, but are not limited to,
How do we ensure socially optimal levels of investment in integrated energy systems, considering risk-averse market participants and uncertainty? How should different technologies be remunerated?What kind of financial products allow hedging financial risks for consumers and producers at an acceptable cost?With electricity taking up an ever growing share of the end-energy use and new types of large electricity users such as electrolyzers, how does this change the role of the different actors in the system?

To address these questions, you are expected to continue the development of equilibrium and optimization models describing how energy markets coordinate actors’ decision making, leveraging a mix of techniques from operations research, engineering and economics.

We are looking for a new PhD candidate to start as soon as possible. Your main supervisor will be Kenneth Bruninx, Assistant Professor Industry & Energy Transition. You will join a lively community of internationally renowned interdisciplinary energy researchers in the Department of Engineering Systems and Services. Our faculty hosts a diverse group of people from different countries and disciplines, and we welcome candidates that contribute to and enjoy this diversity.
