Human behaviour is at the heart of combatting climate change and promoting a healthy and inclusive society with equal opportunities. That is why researchers who aim to understand and apply insights into behaviour change towards sustainability are key. As a full professor, you will take on a leading role in the theme of sustainability, integrate research and teaching on this topic, and flourish in a friendly and vibrant academic community.

Radboud University is seeking a full professor of Psychology with a focus on Enduring Behaviour Change for Sustainability. Radboud University and its Faculty of Social Sciences have put ambitious goals concerning sustainability at the top of their research, teaching and impact agendas. A key aspect of the challenge to promote a sustainable society and planet is the role of behaviour and behaviour change. When it comes to combating climate change and promoting a healthy and inclusive society with equal opportunities, human behaviour is at the heart of the problem, and a fundamental understanding and application of behaviour change is crucial to the solution process. Against this background, we are looking for a Chairholder who will contribute to achieving the impact and sustainability goals as formulated by Radboud University and the Faculty of Social Sciences.

A central responsibility of this Chair is to advance fundamental knowledge of how long-term and enduring behaviour change for sustainability can be promoted. As a professor you will do so by conducting both experimental and applied research on one of the following key areas relevant to sustainability: 1. environmentally responsible behaviour, 2. health and wellbeing, 3. diversity and inclusion, and 4. social relationships. Additionally, the fundamental scientific knowledge gained will be disseminated through teaching and cooperative projects with societal partners. An important task is to build a bridge between research, teaching and society in order to collaborate on the sustainability agenda and to create effective behaviour change initiatives. The insights gained will inform the development of policy and practical interventions to promote sustainability.

You will teach topics addressing enduring and long-term behaviour change, and integrate research and teaching on this topic from an interdisciplinary perspective. You will actively seek to make connections with other disciplines for co-creation of teaching on sustainability topics within the social sciences, such as Communication Sciences, Anthropology and Developmental Studies and Radboud University more broadly. You share the vision that high-quality research and high-quality teaching go hand in hand. Critical thinking and the value of fundamental research in understanding behaviour and solving societal issues are central to your teaching.

Within the Faculty of Social Sciences, and Radboud University wide, you will take a leading role on the theme of sustainability and develop initiatives to connect and inspire researchers and teachers on this topic. For example, this could involve connecting researchers to write joint grants on this topic. Your position will include management and leadership tasks within the Behaviour Change and Wellbeing (BCW) research programme, the Social and Cultural Psychology teaching unit, and the Behavioural Science Institute. It is your goal to promote the transition to a more sustainable academic culture in which all stakeholders are collaboratively working towards a healthy, free world with equal opportunities for all. You will be expected to promote a pleasant, productive, inclusive and safe work environment and stimulate talent development and team spirit.
