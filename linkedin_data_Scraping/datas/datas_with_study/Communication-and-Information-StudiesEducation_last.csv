In our Bachelor's and Master's programmes in Communication and Information Studies and the Research Master's programme in Linguistics and Communication Sciences, students are taught to analyse linguistic and communicative choices, and to examine how these choices affect people's beliefs, attitudes and intentions. As the scale of societal issues increases (e.g. in healthcare, social media privacy and misinformation) and researchers more and more acquire or build extensive datasets, there is an urgent need to develop and work with computational methods that are appropriate for the field of language and communication research. The Department of Language and Communication is therefore looking for an Assistant Professor of Communication and Computational Methods.

As an assistant professor, you will develop and teach Bachelor's and Master's courses and conduct research in communication and computational methods. You will contribute to the department's Bachelor's and Master's programmes in Communication and Information Studies, and to the Research Master's programme in Linguistics and Communication Sciences.

We particularly welcome candidates in the domains of persuasion, media effects, and journalism. However, outstanding candidates outside those specific domains will also be considered.
You have proven experience with advanced computational methods (e.g. network analysis, machine learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, or analysis of large audio and/or video datasets as evidenced by research projects, publications and/or teaching experience.
You hold a PhD in a communication science (completed before the starting date of this position) or in another relevant discipline such as computer science, provided the research is centred on an area of communication science.
You have a strong track record in research (proportional to career stage).
You have a demonstrated ability to interact and establish links with other communication science subdisciplines.
You have the ambition to develop new courses integrating modern computational tools for communication (at both graduate and undergraduate level).
You have a vision on, and perhaps experience with, ways to link your domain with other knowledge domains, based on an articulated teaching and research philosophy.
You are proficient in Dutch. If Dutch is not your native language, you will be expected to become proficient in Dutch at the C1 level within two years.

PhDs for project about the causes and consequences of societal threat perceptions,"2 PhDs for project about the causes and consequences of societal threat perceptions
Faculteit/Dienst: Faculteit der Maatschappij- & Gedragswetenschappen
Opleidingsniveau: Master
Functie type: Promotieplaats
Sluitingsdatum: 17 April 2023
Vacaturenummer: 11360
We are looking for 2 PhD candidates to join a new research project lead by Dr. Bert N. Bakker (PI), supported by an NWO VIDI grant. The project is embedded in the Hot Politics Lab (an interdisciplinary research group focusing on political psychology) and the Amsterdam School of Communication Research at the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences.
This project starts with the observations that with a pandemic, the war in Ukriane, climate change, terrorist attacks, and financial meltdowns, we have in the last twenty years experienced multiple threats that potentially could have (or will in the future) fundamentally alter our way of life. Threats have adverse effects when they erode democratic stability by sparking violence and fuelling support for anti-democratic politics. However, threats might benefit society when they trigger desired behaviour, such as reducing the eco-footprint or getting a vaccination. Given the complex role of threat in society, it is crucial to understand better the processes underlying people's threat perceptions and develop strategies for mitigating the adverse effects and stimulating the beneficial effects of threat perceptions on democracy and society. This project bridges theories from communication science, psychology, and neuroscience by the overarching research question: How do people perceive and regulate threats and adopt political attitudes and behaviours to counter these threats.
In this project, we will be studying the explicit (self-reported) and implicit (psychophysiological) instantiations of threats and their interplay. To do this, the project will use an innovative mixed-methods design: in-depth interviews, cross-country surveys, survey experiments, and laboratory experiments, as well as intensive experience sampling studies that track threats over multiple days. The project description can be found here.

What are you going to do

The basic plans for the PhD projects are stated below. These will be adapted to the interest and expertise of the hired candidates.
PhD 1 focuses on the causes and consequences of societal threats. Research in political communication suggests elite cues cause people to see issues and events as threatening or not. Drawing upon appraisal theory (Scherer & Moors, 2019), one might expect that controllability and distance to the threat are causing threat perceptions. Step 1 in this project is to study the causes (elite cues, framing) that elicit perceptions of societal threats among citizens. In step 2, we will be exploring the causes of these societal threat perceptions to answer the question whether citizens adopt political attitudes and behaviours to counter the threat. The empirical approach of this project consists of survey-experiments, laboratory-based experiments using physiological measures (skin conductance, facial EMG) as well as eye-tracking, and computer-assisted content analysis.
PhD 2 focuses on the question to what extent citizens regulate societal threats, and to what extent does the regulation of threat condition the effects of threats on politics? In this project, we will be analysing the common threat regulation strategies in response to societal threats and their effect on political attitudes and behaviours to tackle the threat. In response to a threat, people could, for instance, engage in: cognitive reappraisal and reframe situations to change the emotional impact (e.g., climate change is threatening, but there is hope as climate change offers opportunities to recreate a better society); down-regulation and lower the intensity of the threat (about, for instance, climate change); or distraction and direct attention away from the threat (e.g., shifting attention from climate change to other (non-)political topics that are not threatening). PhD 2 will be exploring why, when and how people regulate societal and imagined threats and the consequences this has for the effects of threats on politics. The empirical approach consists of in-depth interviews, surveys, experience sampling (or diary) studies, and experiments.
What do you have to offer

You are:
eager to contribute to the scientific field;
curious to combine insights from communication science, political science and psychology, both theoretically and methodologically;
motivated to share your knowledge with academic and non-academic audiences;
strongly committed to methodological rigor and scientific integrity;
curious and eager to learn new skills, theoretical perspectives and practical issues;
motivated to contribute to the Hot Politics Lab and Amsterdam School of Communication Research.

Your experience and profile:

You have:
a (Research) Master’s degree in Communication Science, Political Science, Psychology or a related field;
experience with physiological or eye-tracking data acquisition and data analysis is highly desired (especially in case of PhD 1);
a firm basis in and ideally experience with research methods and data analysis, in particular: experimentation (survey & laboratory), computer-assisted content analysis ( in case of PhD 1), and experience sampling studies (in case of PhD 2);
experience in and commitment to engage work following open science principles such as replication and preregistration (including power analyses);
basic programming skills (in R or Python) or high motivation to learn scientific computing;
an excellent written and spoken command of English,
being able to speak and write in Dutch is desirable but not necessary;
excellent social and organizational skills.

What can we offer you

The planned start date is September 1st, 2023 but there is some flexibility about the starting date. The position concerns temporary employment of 1.0 fte (38 hours per week) for a maximum term of 4 years. The initial employment is for one year. Following a positive assessment and barring altered circumstances, this term will be extended by a maximum of 36 months, which should result in the conferral of a doctorate. In consultation with the supervision team, the successful candidate will design a custom curriculum which will also include the opportunity to attend training courses and both national and international events. Teaching can be part of the tasks.

Your salary will be €2541 gross per month in the first year and will increase to €3247 in the final year, based on full-time employment and in keeping with the Collective Labour Agreement of Dutch Universities. We additionally offer an extensive package of secondary benefits, including 8% holiday allowance and a year-end bonus of 8.3%.

PhD candidate Children's digital media use and their social development(0.8FTE for 5 years)
Vacancy number: 13565
Today’s children and youth (C&Y) are immersed in digital media in the full media landscape that surrounds them across contexts. The Covid pandemic revealed inequal opportunities for C&Y to use digital media. There are differences in digital media access, motivation/skills to use digital media, and support of key persons (e.g., parents/teachers/peers) herein. Understanding mechanisms in C&Y’s digital media use related to their development helps them and key persons to act in evidence-informed ways to reduce inequality. A better understanding of these factors is especially important during transition periods (i.e., from kindergarten to primary school or the early years in secondary school). During these periods, deviations in development could strongly impact C&Y’s opportunities. Our aim is that scientists, parents, professionals and C&Y understand the mechanisms that influence the relations between C&Y's digital media use, their development and opportunities. Furthermore, we want to develop skills and tools to support a positive impact of C&Y’s digital media use on development and equality of opportunities.

In English, 'uptalk' (the use of pitch rises at the end of statements) can evoke strong reactions; e.g. uptalk is seen as a marker of insecurity and hesitance used primarily by young women. As a PhD candidate, you will critically evaluate the existing literature on British English uptalk and carry out production studies and perception experiments to understand the phonetic forms uptalk can take, its pragmatic functions, and its social evaluation.

We are looking for a PhD candidate in sociophonetics, focusing on the study of prosody, for a project on uptalk in British English. Uptalk is defined as the use of pitch rises (instead of falls) at the end of statements. Stereotypically, uptalk is said to indicate speaker insecurity or a cooperative attitude, while its use has been associated with younger women who are often said to talk as if they are asking questions.

There are, however, many issues with these stereotypes about uptalk. First, there are many varieties of British English (e.g. in Bristol, Liverpool, and Tyneside) in which rises are used by default at the end of statements. These rises are not considered instances of uptalk on the grounds that they do not convey some special meaning. This implies that uptalk carries such special meaning, but speakers of varieties said to have uptalk (e.g. varieties in New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and California) do not assign special meaning to all instances of uptalk. This begs the question of what counts as uptalk and what criteria can be used to determine if uptalk is a feature of a given linguistic variety. Further, research in uptalking varieties of English suggests that uptalk has diverse uses and that different forms of uptalk may be associated with different pragmatic functions. Finally, these studies also suggest that uptalk is not used exclusively by certain demographic groups, such as young women; in turn, this indicates that uptalk may be wider spread but noticeable only when used by speakers of certain groups because the stereotypes of the listeners lead them to expect uptalk only from these groups.

Given the above uncertainties, the aim of this project is to critically evaluate the existing research on uptalk from phonetic, pragmatic, and sociolinguistic perspectives, focusing on British English uses and users of uptalk. The goals of the project include a thorough documentation of the forms that uptalk can take, a better understanding of the pragmatics associated with it and of the social evaluation that it leads to, depending on the demographics of the users.

For this project, you will be supervised by a team of researchers consisting of Prof. Amalia Arvaniti (Chair), Dr Stefan Gronderlaers and Dr Jarret Geenen (co-supervisors). Though the scope of the project is indicated above, it is expected that the final research plan will be developed in collaboration with you to reflect your research interests as well as those of the PhD committee.

Your teaching load will be up to 10% of your working time.

Profile
You hold a Master's degree in linguistics.
You have demonstrable grounding in at least two of the following: phonetics, sociolinguistics, pragmatics.
You have an excellent command of written and spoken English.
You have an understanding of socially related variation in British English or a sufficient background in the study of variation to quickly acquire the background necessary for this project.
You have a good understanding of either corpus-based or experimental methods in linguistics preferably demonstrated by work experience, publications, or a relevant Master's thesis.
Demonstrable interest in the study of prosody will be a strong advantage.
We are

As a PhD candidate, you will be affiliated with Radboud's Centre for Language Studies (CLS).

The Faculty of Arts at Radboud University is looking for a postdoctoral researcher to collaborate on the project 'Poison, Medicine or Magic Potion? Shifting Perceptions of Drugs in and from Latin America (1820-2020)', which was recently awarded a grant by the Dutch Research Council. As a postdoctoral researcher, you will join the VICI research team (including two PhD candidates, two postdoctoral researchers and the PI) and also be a member of the Radboud Institute for Culture and History (RICH) and the department of Modern Languages and Cultures (MTC).
The Radboud Institute for Culture and History is looking for a postdoctoral researcher for the NWO-funded project Poison, Medicine or Magic Potion? Shifting Perceptions of 'Drugs' in and from Latin America (1820-2020). The conception of drugs has differed greatly over time, and the distinction between 'illegal drugs' and 'legal medicines' continues to be contested. An increasing number of scientists claim that it is necessary to demythologise drugs and to revise the perception that they constitute a threat to society. Latin America plays a key role in this debate, as psychoactive plants are part of its natural resources and Indigenous cultural history.

The main aim of this project is to analyse the changing perceptions of drugs in Latin America from the continent's independence to the present day (1820-2020). The project focuses on the representation of ayahuasca, peyote and coca/cocaine over time. It uses a partially unexplored corpus of discourses on these plants, including literature, ethnography and travel writing. The project will nuance the complex yet often reductive link between drugs and violence by studying the multifaceted perceptions of drugs from a cross-cultural, diachronic and interdisciplinary perspective. Two workshops and a symposium with stakeholders will examine how cultural perceptions of drugs influence policy making and vice versa.


As a postdoctoral researcher, you will analyse and compare shifting perceptions of ayahuasca, coca/cocaine and peyote in museums and memorials, and uncover how these intersect with national and legal constitutions of indigenous culture and religion. The comparative dimension will open a fruitful discussion with broader scholarship on the relation between Indigenous knowledge and heritage. You will use the different theoretical frameworks of the project (decolonial theory, posthumanism and affect studies) to study cultural heritage in the Amazonian Basin, the Andes region, the Sierra Madre Occidental, and the Netherlands. You will contribute to the development of the PhD candidates' methodological and theoretical skills and will work closely together with your fellow postdoctoral researcher on Drugs and Tourism in Latin America. In addition, you will work with scientific and societal partners in Latin America and in the Netherlands. You will organise several events for stakeholders in Nijmegen and make a podcast together with the other members of the team.


Your research will be embedded in RICH. Apart from the specific context of the VICI research project, you will participate in one of its research groups and contribute to the institute in general. Together with the present staff of the research institutes, you will set up research collaborations on these topics. You will publish about your research in highly qualified journals, conference proceedings, or edited volumes. Lastly, you will be expected to teach a limited number of Bachelor's and Master's courses.
Profile
You hold a PhD in a relevant field, such as Anthropology, Cultural Studies, Heritage Studies or a comparable discipline.
You have excellent oral and writing skills in Spanish (C2 or native) and hold a Cambridge Certificate (CPE2 level) in English or equivalent, or you are committed to obtaining this certificate within six months.
You are able to work independently and flexibly, taking initiative where needed, but are also able to communicate and collaborate effectively in a team setting.
You have administrative and organisational skills and you easily manage social media.
You are willing to live in the Netherlands during the contract period and to do field work in Latin America.
You have a track record of international high-profile publications.
Demonstrable experience in collaborating with museums in Latin America and with fieldwork is highly recommended.
Demonstrable experience in interdisciplinary research, including ethnobotany, environmental humanities, historiography or anthropology, is recommended.
Passive knowledge of Indigenous languages of Latin America relevant in this field and of Dutch is considered an advantage.

European Forest Researcher,"Are you challenged by the role of forests and forest management towards a sustainable future? Would you like to use your knowledge on forests to improve our understanding of climate smart forest management within Europe? Are you interested to find solutions for the challenges in the chain of wooden products? Then we might be looking for you!

The Vegetation, Forest and Landscape ecology Team (VBL) is an enthusiastic team of about 40 colleagues working on options for conservation, restoration, development and sustainable use of vegetation, forests and landscapes from an ecological perspective. We focus on the way in which policy, management and climate affect ecological processes and what their consequences are for climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation and restoration, delivery of ecosystem services and other specific policy goals.

An important element of our work is the development and application of European forest simulation models. Such models help to understand and visualize the role that European forests play for biodiversity, climate, renewable resources, and the environment and how Climate-Smart Forest management can contribute to optimize this role. With these models, we help managers and various authorities (local, regional, national and European) to evaluate and further shape forest and climate policies.

We are looking for a researcher that can help us to further integrate spatially explicit concepts and data into our research and simulation models and to link the model work with remote sensing products. You will also be responsible for the exchange of information (providing forest inventory data, receiving remote sensing products) with project partners.

Besides this, you will also orientate yourself on developments in related (forest) ecological disciplines. In the team and within projects, you contribute to simulation model development, research, editing and interpreting research results together with a senior researcher or project leader. You will also contribute to the acquisition of externally funded scientific research on Dutch and European forests in the context of (climate) policy and management studies. Also contributing to lectures, reports and publications as well as supervision of junior researchers will be part of your work.

To strengthen our team we are looking for a researcher with a background and interest in forest modelling, with a strong focus on handling and integrating spatial forest information and remote sensing. We prefer at least 5 years of working experience in these fields, but will also consider candidates with less working experience but with an excellent track record. Wageningen University & Research offers excellent terms of employment. A few highlights from our Collective Labour Agreement include:
working hours that can be discussed and arranged so that they allow for the best possible work-life balance;
the option to accrue additional compensation hours by working more, up to 40 hours per week;
sabbatical leave, study leave, and partially paid parental leave;
there is a strong focus on vitality and you can make use of the sports facilities available on campus for a small fee;
a fixed December bonus of 4%;
excellent pension scheme.
In addition to these first-rate employee benefits, you will of course receive a good salary. We offer, depending on your experience, a competitive gross salary of between € 2,949,- and €5,479,- for a full-time working week of 36 hours, in accordance with the CLA Wageningen Research (scale 10-11). This is a full-time position for a period of 1 year, a part-time contract for 32 hours per week is negotiable. When functioning properly and with good business results, the position can be extended.

Wageningen University & Research encourages internal advancement opportunities and mobility with an internal recruitment policy. There are plenty of options for personal initiative in a learning environment, and we provide excellent training opportunities. We are offering a multi-faceted position in an international environment with a pleasant and open working atmosphere.

Postdoctoral researcher studying the institutional forms of societal trust in the digital society,"Postdoctoral researcher studying the institutional forms of societal trust in the digital society
Faculteit/Dienst: Faculteit der Rechtsgeleerdheid
Opleidingsniveau: Gepromoveerd
Functie type: Wetenschappelijk Personeel
Sluitingsdatum: 15.04.2023
Vacaturenummer: 11262
The Faculty of Law, Institute for Information Law (IViR), and the University Research Priority Area on Trust in the Digital Society (TRUST RPA: https://www.ivir.nl/trust-in-the-digital-society-new-uva-research-priority-area/ ) is looking for a postdoctoral researcher to study the institutional safeguards of trustworthy centralized and decentralized techno-social infrastructures.

The TRUST RPA is a five year long interdisciplinary research initiative to study how we trust is changing due to the emergence of new trust production technologies, and the disruption of existing trust relations.

The digital society relies on an ever-expanding network of digital infrastructures. This forces us to rethink some of our basic assumptions about one of the most fundamental resources in all interpersonal, social, economic relations: trust.
Despite their widespread use, we know little about the trustworthiness of our digital infrastructures. At best it is difficult to establish their trustworthiness (such as with AI), at worst they are proven to be untrustworthy (as is the case with social media).
Some of these digital infrastructures play key roles in interpersonal and societal trust dynamics. They disrupt existing trust relations and offer new ways to trust each other.
Our scientific methods and theories face serious limits when it comes to the study of change of social structures, institutions, and processes under the conditions of rapid technological transformation. Research on trust in technology and trust by technology is siloed, and focuses on narrowly defined technologies (AI), or problems (system security), and lacks a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, long-term-view.

This postdoctoral position (embedded in the TRUST RPA, supervised by both the Institute for Information Law, at the Amsterdam Law School, and at least one other participating faculty) will use empirical research to study how various new technological infrastructures disrupt or can enhance existing societal (impersonal, institutional) trust relations and strive to establish new forms of trust relations in society.

What are you going to do?

 The successful candidate will:
Conduct empirical, qualitative research (interviews, case studies, discourse analysis) on the dynamics of institutional, impersonal trust with regards to emerging digital technologies, such as digital platforms, web3 technologies, or Machine Learning based automated systems.
Coordinate the development, fieldwork and initial analysis of a large-scale longitudinal survey
Conduct work on the emerging European technology regulation framework (Digital Services Act, AI Act, Digital Markets Act) using doctrinal research, normative research and discourse analysis
Organize events, conferences
Participate in grant proposal development, international network building
Acquiree funding

The Postdoctoral researcher will be hired by the Faculty of Law, closely collaborating with two other postdoctoral researchers in the Trust RPA. The team will be supervised by the PIs of the TRUS RPA: Balazs Bodo, Associate Professor at the Institute of Information Law (IViR) at the Faculty of Law, Jan B. Engelmann, Professor of Neuroeconomics at the Amsterdam School of Economics, Theo Araujo, Associate Professor Communication in the Digital Society at the Amsterdam School of Communication Research (ASCoR), Tom van Engers, Professor in Legal Knowledge Management at the University of Amsterdam, and Marc Tuters, Assistant Professor in the New Media and Digital Culture Division of Media Studies at the Faculty of Humanities.

What do we require of you?

 The successful candidate has:
a PhD degree in law, or social sciences (sociology, economics, political science, communication science, science and technology studies or related fields)
strong empirical research skills;
familiarity with qualitative research methods,
familiarity with doctrinal research or policy research;
good knowledge of current developments in information markets and technology;
academic excellence, as shown in the grade transcripts and curriculum vitae.
a creative mind and analytical intelligence;
an interest in working in a multidisciplinary team;
willingness to learn new knowledge, and acquire new skills required by the project;
excellent written and spoken command of English, and ideally knowledge of Dutch
interest in working on interdisciplinary topics, in interdisciplinary teams.

Candidates, who have:
quantitative skills, including survey development, statistical analysis, and/or
familiarity with R, python or any other programming language, and/or
big data collection and analysis skills, and/or
previous experience in the private or public sector

will be given extra consideration in the application process.

We strongly encourage members of broadly understood minority socio-cultural groups to apply. We believe that there are several traditionally underrepresented, but incredibly forceful perspectives, that have transformed our respective disciplines. Recent scholarship by persons of colour, feminist, intersectionalist scholars, scholars from the Global South have highlighted fundamental issues with the design, operation, and impact of techno-social systems that remained in the blind spots of mainstream scholarship. Without such contributions, serious problems, such as racial bias in AI systems, would have gone unnoticed and left unaddressed by more careful technical design and better regulation.

Our offer

We offer a temporary employment contract for 38 hours per week for a period of 36 months with a probationary period of two months. The preferred starting date is as soon possible.
The gross monthly salary, based on 30,4 -38 (0.8-1 FTE) hours per week and dependent on relevant experience, ranges between € 2,960 to € 4,670 (scale 10). UvA additionally offers an extensive package of secondary benefits, including 8% holiday allowance and a year-end bonus of 8.3%. The UFO profile Researcher 4 is applicable. A favourable tax agreement, the ‘30% ruling’, may apply to non-Dutch applicants. The Collective Labour Agreement of Universities of the Netherlands is applicable.

Besides the salary and a vibrant and challenging environment we offer you multiple fringe benefits:
232 holiday hours per year (based on fulltime) and extra holidays between Christmas and 1 January;
Multiple courses to follow from our Teaching and Learning Centre;
Multiple courses on topics such as leadership for academic staff;
Multiple courses on topics such as time management, handling stress and an online learning platform with 100+ different courses;

Partly paid parental leave;
The possibility to set up a workplace at home;
A pension at ABP for which UvA pays two third part of the contribution;
The possibility to follow courses to learn Dutch;

What else do we offer
the possibility to start up and grow a New Research priority Area at the UvA,
close working relations with five faculties of the UvA; and with TU Delft, and Erasmus University, Rotterdam
freedom to develop your own research agenda;
welcoming, international, dynamic teams;
an inspiring academic and professional environment in the heart of Amsterdam;
excellent possibilities for further professional development and education.

PhD Law and Innovation in Quantum Technologies,"PhD Law and Innovation in Quantum Technologies
Faculteit/Dienst: Faculteit der Rechtsgeleerdheid
Opleidingsniveau: Master
Functie type: Promotieplaats
Sluitingsdatum: 24.04.2023
Vacaturenummer: 11246
Do you want to study one of the core legal questions in emerging quantum technology value chains? And do you want to contribute to a vision on how the law can support equitable development of quantum technologies?

This PhD position on Law and Innovation in Quantum Technologies is part of the new research group on the law and governance of quantum technologies at the Institute for Information Law, University of Amsterdam. The Institute for Information Law is one of the largest research facilities in information law world-wide. The Institute brings together more than 40 researchers from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds. The research group is a part of Action line 4 on the Ethical, Legal And Societal Aspects of Quantum Technologies of the Quantum Delta NL ecosystem.

What are you going to do

Intellectual property in the broad sense plays a vital role in advanced technology industries. Over the last years, public and private investment in quantum technologies, including quantum computing, communications and sensing, have received a significant boost. Innovation and development of quantum technologies is giving rise to specific questions of law and global value chains. Private sector quantum innovation strategies rely on strong protection through patents, trade secrets and other (quasi) intellectual property. This raises questions in relation to competition and equitable access to advanced quantum technologies across different stakeholders and internationally. National science and technology policies attempt to support thriving national and transnational quantum technology ecosystems, seeking protection for knowledge and skilled personnel. Concentrations of private power and geo-political competition around quantum technology development may lead a world of quantum haves and have-nots, increasing global inequalities. Early initiatives relating to quantum technologies at the international level include calls for responsible tech development, and recognition of human rights guarantees and Sustainable Development Goals.

Building on insights from the work on Law and Global Value Chains (GVCs), this PhD will engage with the following questions. What role do law and legal practice in the area of law and innovation (intellectual property, including trade secrets, contract law) play in emergent quantum technology ecosystems? What alternative arrangements are or can be imagined in relation to quantum technology intellectual property portfolio’s, in particular to further equitable development, open innovation and access to quantum technologies? How does law support different positions and strategies of relevant actors, and how do other governance tools, such as standardization, help relevant actors address tensions between security and other interests? How might a clash between open quantum innovation and securitization of quantum technology production be resolved, also in light of a new European imperative of strategic autonomy?

The PhD project will be part of the research group on the Law and Governance of Quantum Technologies at the Institute for Information Law (IViR) at the Faculty of Law of the University of Amsterdam. You will conduct original cutting-edge research into the law and governance of quantum technologies with a focus on emerging legal practices relating to quantum technology development. You will develop insights into the way in which law relates to the increasingly constitutive function of digital infrastructure in our societies, by conducting different case studies in the area of quantum computing, communications and sensing. Using relevant theory, information law and fundamental rights law, technology governance studies, and empirical methods, you will contribute to our understanding of law and quantum technology ecosystems in Europe and internationally.

What do we require

a completed degree in law, or equivalent degree;
affinity with questions of intellectual property and private law a knowledgeable curiosity for developments in quantum technologies;
knowledge of current legal developments with respect to technology and innovation;
excellent academic credentials, as demonstrated by grades and/or curriculum vitae;
a creative mind and strong critical and analytical skills;
an interest in working across legal disciplines, using different methods (including empirical, theoretical and interdisciplinary), and collaborations with other relevant non-legal disciplines. Some knowledge or experience with conducting empirical research is a plus;
strong communication skills and a commitment to contributing to diverse and inclusive team dynamics;
excellent language skills in English and one or more other languages;

If the vacancy appeals to you, but you are doubting whether you might be THE person we are looking for, please do apply. We particularly welcome applications from candidates from underrepresented backgrounds.

Our offer

We offer a temporary full-time contract for the period of 4 years (with a go no go review assessment after the first year). The preferred starting date is 1 September 2023.

The salary, depending on relevant experience before the beginning of the employment contract, will be € 2,541 to € 3,247 (scale P) gross per month, based on a fulltime contract (38 hours a week).

Lead Enterprise Architect,"Hoe ziet jouw werkdag eruit?

Vandaag werk je op de campus. Je drinkt misschien wat meer koffie om met collega's bij te praten en verzet wat minder bergen dan als je thuis werkt, maar die afwisseling is juist heel fijn. Best of both worlds! De ochtend start met een overleg met de CIO, waarin jullie de agenda van de ITboard bespreken. Jij hebt het agendapunt van de Digitalisering Strategie op je naam staan en jij wilt graag een strategisch dialoog voeren over optimaal ruimte gebruik d.m.v. monitoring. Daarvoor spreek je die middag met enkele directeuren van de instituten en kenniscentra, zodat je verhaal goed is afgestemd op hun behoefte en taal. Uit die gesprekken haal je ook weer nieuwe bewegingen. De samenwerking met de beroepspraktijk vraagt toch behoorlijk wat van onze infrastructuur, daarvoor ga je een sessie beleggen met IAM en security experts. Die puzzel moet te kraken zijn!

Natuurlijk heb je kennis van methoden en technieken met betrekking tot het ontwerpen en beschrijven van architectuur in brede zin of ben je bereid dit te leren.

Waarom bij ons werken?

Wie kan dat beter vertellen dan jouw mogelijk toekomstige collega, Joost Veerman. Joost is Enterprise Architect: ‘Ik overzie, modelleer en bewaak van grotere hoogte de samenhang in samenspraak met belanghebbenden en specialisten. Als team samen wat realiseren, dat vind ik het mooiste wat er is. Binnen de hogeschool is vanuit ICT perspectief veel te doen. Aan de ene kant zijn we bezig om registersystemen meer solide te maken en aan de andere kant vraagt het onderwijs om innovatieve leeromgevingen. Daarbij maakt ICT gebruik van state-of-the-art infrastructuur. Dat was voor mij ook een reden om hier te solliciteren. Werken bij de hogeschool biedt veel mogelijkheden om je te specialiseren. Andere voordelen? Voor bijscholing hoef je hier niet ver te zoeken. De HU stimuleert je ontwikkeling en biedt ondersteuning in kosten en werktijd-compensatie. Maar voor mij is ook de sfeer heel belangrijk. Mensen zijn hier erg begaan met het product. Dat maakt het vooral zo leuk om hier te werken. En dat je de hele dag tussen jonge mensen loopt. Als ICT’er zit je hier altijd aan de voorkant van nieuwe ontwikkelingen.’
