Online Marketeer,"Zichtbaar en vindbaar zijn voor de juiste doelgroepen, dat is jouw streven. Als online marketing specialist sta jij in jouw kracht als jij eigenaar mag zijn van thema’s als websiteoptimalisatie, social media en meer. Van nature werk jij planmatig en doelgericht. Meten is weten en zonder stip op de horizon komt er natuurlijk niets van de grond. Herkenbaar? Lees dan snel verder wat je kan gaan doen in de rol van Online Marketeer bij Rademaker!


Culemborg

Fulltime
Wie zijn wij?
Rademaker ontwikkelt en produceert machines voor de voedingsmiddelenindustrie, in het bijzonder voor industriële bakkerijen. Een sector waarin technologie en techniek centraal staan. Met een positie in de top van de internationale markt, behoren de grootste voedselproducenten tot de klantenkring van Rademaker. Rademaker beheerst het hele spectrum; van verkoop, engineering, productie en montage op onze productiesites in Culemborg en Slowakije, tot eindmontage en inbedrijfstelling bij onze klanten. Rademaker kent een informele sfeer en een echte hands-on mentaliteit, samen staan we voor kwaliteit!
Als uitbreiding op het marketing team, bestaande uit drie Marketing & Communicatie specialisten, zijn we op zoek naar een collega Online Marketeer.
Wat ga je doen in de functie van Online Marketeer?
Als Online Marketeer ben je specialist binnen het marketing team en is het jouw missie om onze online marketing activiteiten naar een hoger plan te tillen. We nodigen jou uit om onze online vindbaarheid en zichtbaarheid te analyseren en deze te verbeteren. Naast onze Rademaker producten zijn we een nieuwe productgroep aan het introduceren. Deze nieuwe productgroep vraagt ook om ontwikkeling van een eigen website, het liefst binnen eenzelfde omgeving. Dit is een belangrijk project die jij op zal gaan pakken.
Als Online Marketeer werk je nauw samen met jouw collega’s en enkele externe marketingpartners, waar we bepaalde werkzaamheden bij (kunnen) beleggen. In jouw rol wordt er niet van je verwacht dat je bestaande en nieuwe websites zelf ontwikkelt. Wel zal je een belangrijke coördinerende en bewakende rol hebben in het bedenken van gewenste functionaliteiten. Online content, op onze websites of op social media, zal je daarentegen vaak wél zelf - of in samenwerking met jouw collega’s - opstellen. Het optimaliseren en vervolgens ook het beheren van onze SEO en SEA is vanuit jouw expertise een mooi voorbeeld van een onderdeel van jouw takenpakket.
Omdat ruim 95% van onze klanten buitenlandse industriële bakkerijen betreft, is onze content geheel Engelstalig. Als Online Marketeer bevinden jouw doelgroepen zich dan ook wereldwijd, wat je rol divers én uitdagend maakt. Lukt het je om de juiste online snaren te raken met al die verschillende talen, culturen en communicatiemiddelen?
Wat zoeken wij in onze nieuwe collega?
Wij worden enthousiast van jou als we jouw expertise herkennen op het gebied van online marketing binnen een internationale B2B omgeving. Vooral een verantwoordelijke en sturende rol bij projecten rondom websiteoptimalisatie is voor ons belangrijk. We vinden het ook waardevol als jij al hebt ervaren dat verschillende internationale markten een hele eigen benadering vragen. De Engelse taal kan jij op professioneel niveau inzetten, zowel in de vorm van online content als in de samenwerking met internationale collega’s en klanten.
Uiteindelijk vinden we het nóg belangrijker dat jij voldoening haalt uit jouw werk en dat jij jouw drijfveren kan inzetten. Als jij het belangrijk vindt om de effecten van jouw werk meetbaar te maken en om samen naar een doel toe te werken, dan gaan we een succesvolle samenwerking tegemoet!
Het liefst ben jij fulltime beschikbaar en woon je binnen een straal van zo'n 35 kilometer van Culemborg.
Wat hebben wij jou te bieden?
Wij bieden een uitdagende en verantwoordelijke baan in een internationaal groeiende organisatie. Wij hopen samen met jou verder te gaan bouwen aan deze groei! Inzet en resultaat worden gewaardeerd met een passend salaris tot €4.200 bruto per maand op basis van 40 uur in de week en goede secundaire arbeidsvoorwaarden, zoals:

Is the product content complete and up-to-date? What’s the ranking of the product and how did the findability of the e-commerce platform itself develop? And how is the relationship with the customer developing?

You dig easily into all possible reasons why sales has increased or decreased and you can explain key findings to colleagues (of various departments) and you continuously search for future improvements.

Within this position, you have contact with various internal stakeholders, such as Product Developers, Account Managers, Marketeers and IT specialists. Besides this, you are in direct contact with the customers of PF Concept throughout Europe. So you are the “international face” of Digital sales at PF Concept.

Who are you?

Do you already have some working or internship experience in online merchandising and do you have a sharp and commercial eye for details and opportunities? Can you combine creativity with problem-solving and a hands-on mentality? Then you are already on the right track. You also have:

HBO diploma preferably towards e-commerce, communication or marketing;

0 to 2 years of relevant working experience;

Excellent listening and communication skills at different levels;

Good understanding of the Dutch and English language verbally and written;

Customer supportive, stress resistance and a team player;

MS Office package is your best friend, especially Excel and Powerpoint;

Passion to grow and willing to learn and to follow training/ courses.

Our offer to you!

Besides a pleasant working atmosphere, a place to grow your talents, a flat organization with an open culture, where one’s own input and initiative is rewarded, we offer you:

Good salary that matches with the knowledge and experience you bring;

Laptop and the option to work partially from home fully equipped and with extra budget for a good working place;

25 (or more) holidays, a premium-free pension, money to celebrate your birthday, travel allowance for every kilometer you travel and more;

Allowances to keep you fit and healthy, free fruit and every day different lunch options available at rock bottom prices;

A dynamic and inspiring world of promotional usables and business premiums which you can buy in our own shop;

Never a dull moment!

What do we stand for!

Within PF concept we have a clear vision, mission and values. We have a number of competencies that belong to our (new) team members. Most important one is that we put our (internal) customers first in our thoughts and actions and that we provide optimal support to them.

We always go for the best performance and are curious about new opportunities and possibilities. Every day a little better and stronger than the day before. We are a reliable partner for our customers and each other. In addition, we think forward about what we do and want to do, but above all we also have a down to earth view of things.

And last but not least: we are convinced that optimal cooperation and mutual respect is the best basis for our success.

Together with about 2,000 dedicated and enthusiastic team members in Europe we take pride in what we do and always strive to find the most innovative and creative solutions for our customers with sustainable and meaningful products.

We also believe that everybody has a talent, no matter who you are, what you will do, where you come from or what identity or orientation you have.
