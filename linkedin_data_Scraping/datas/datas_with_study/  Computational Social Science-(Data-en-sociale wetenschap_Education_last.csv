PhD (Quantum) Data Governance and the Law of Sensing and Measurement,"PhD (Quantum) Data Governance and the Law of Sensing and Measurement
Faculteit/Dienst: Faculteit der Rechtsgeleerdheid
Opleidingsniveau: Master
Functie type: Promotieplaats
Sluitingsdatum: 24.04.2023
Vacaturenummer: 11243
Do you want to contribute to a vision on how to address new sensing capabilities of 21st century digital infrastructures in data governance law? And do you want to study one of the core legal and governance questions with respect to quantum technologies?

This PhD position on (Quantum) Data Governance and the Law of Sensing and Measurement is part of the new research group on the law and governance of quantum technologies at the Institute for Information Law, University of Amsterdam. The Institute for Information Law is one of the largest research facilities in information law world-wide. The Institute brings together more than 40 researchers from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds. The research group is a part of Action line 4 on the Ethical, Legal And Societal Aspects of Quantum Technologies of the Quantum Delta NL ecosystem.

What are you going to do

Over the last years, public and private investment in quantum technologies, including quantum computing, communications and sensing, have received a significant boost. Quantum computing has been the most eye catching in the quantum tech innovation landscape. It promises, when fully realized, to add additional special-purpose computational capacity to our current-day digital infrastructure. The advancement of quantum sensing technologies has proceeded with less fanfare, despite more advanced technology-readiness and wide possible application areas. Quantum sensing technologies promise to enhance digital infrastructures in ways that may have significant societal implications.

Measurement and sensing, including the establishment of standards and the collection of digital data in socio-technical settings, is a core function of current-day digital infrastructures. Through sensing, digital infrastructure facilitates processes of capture. This can be capture of operations, of behavior, and of environments, each creating new possibilities for control and governance in the process. Innovations in quantum sensing technologies may reconfigure such possibilities of capture in new ways.

Taking the increasing entanglement of law and digital infrastructure as a starting point, this PhD project will engage with the following questions. What are some of the unique legal challenges that quantum sensing applications may create in light of current information law, fundamental rights (including the right to private life and data protection)? Do some of the unique properties of quantum information (such as the possibility of entanglement and no cloning) and particular quantum sensing and metrology applications call into question the relation of law to information and data, as it has developed over the last decades? How can law support the beneficial and responsible use of quantum sensing applications while addressing such legal challenges? What challenges do disruptive sensing technologies pose for the law-infrastructure relationship? And finally, how should law respond to the dual-use nature of certain quantum sensing applications and contribute to the proper balance between the different societal interests implicated by quantum sensing technologies?

The PhD project will be part of the research group on the Law and Governance of Quantum Technologies at the Institute for Information Law (IViR) at the Faculty of Law of the University of Amsterdam. You will conduct original cutting-edge research into the law and governance of quantum technologies, quantum sensing technologies in particular. You will develop new insights into the specific legal implications of particular quantum sensing applications. And using legal theory, information law and other relevant disciplines, and while engaging with relevant stakeholders, you will contribute to our understanding of the relation between law and digital infrastructures today and in the quantum age.

What do we require

a completed degree in law, or equivalent degree;
affinity with questions of data governance and a knowledgeable curiosity for developments in quantum technologies;
good knowledge of current regulatory developments with respect to digital infrastructure and cloud computing;
excellent academic credentials, as demonstrated by grades and/or curriculum vitae;
a creative mind and strong critical and analytical skills;
an interest in working across legal disciplines, using different methods (including empirical, theoretical and interdisciplinary), and collaborations with other relevant non-legal disciplines;
strong communication skills and a commitment to contributing to diverse and inclusive team dynamics;
excellent language skills in English and one or more other languages;

If the vacancy appeals to you, but you are doubting whether you might be THE person we are looking for, please do apply. We particularly welcome applications from candidates from underrepresented backgrounds.

Our offer

We offer a temporary full-time contract for the period of 4 years (with a go no go review assessment after the first year). The preferred starting date is 1 September 2023, with a possibility to start earlier.

The salary, depending on relevant experience before the beginning of the employment contract, will be € 2,541 to € 3,247 (scale P) gross per month, based on a fulltime contract (38 hours a week). This is exclusive 8% holiday allowance and 8.3% end-of-year bonus. A favourable tax agreement, the ‘30% ruling’, may apply to non-Dutch applicants. The Collective Labour Agreement of Dutch Universities is applicable.

The UvA offers excellent possibilities for further professional development and education.

PhD Artificial intelligence for tracking the politics of climate change adaptation,"A highly motivated PhD student on the interface of artificial intelligence and climate action.

Keen to further develop artificial intelligence approaches to enhance climate action? Always wondered why governments are typically reluctant to track their implementation of climate action? Curious about the political dynamics that shape how governments around the globe are (not) adapting to climate change? Then this PhD project on using artificial intelligence methods for analyzing the politics of tracking climate change adaptation could be a great fit!


This PhD position is part of the NWO-VIDI project led by Dr. Robbert Biesbroek (Public Administration and Policy group) entitled “High ambitions, (s)low implementation? The politics of tracking adaptation to climate change (2023-2027).

Background of the program: Adapting to the impacts of climate change is necessary and increasingly urgent. Governments across the globe have increasingly formulated high adaptation ambitions to become more climate resilient. In order to understand if these ambitions are implemented in practice, tracking progress on adaptation is of critical importance. This program aims to develop, theorize and empirically test the causes and consequences of the politics of adaptation tracking. Adopting a comparative approach, the program investigates the political dynamics around the Global Stocktake under the UNFCCC Paris Agreement, the EU Climate Change Adaptation Strategy, and ongoing climate change adaptation developments in several countries from across the globe. In the program mixed methods are used, combining traditional methods of expert interviews, observations and focus group discussions, with machine learning and quantitative text analysis to analyze the politics of adaptation tracking.
The program takes a solutions-oriented perspective by co-designing politically sensitive intervention pathways with practitioners. It provides concrete evidence-based insights where and how to intervene in policy processes in order to accelerate the design and execution of adequate and effective frameworks on adaptation tracking.

There are two PhD positions in this NWO-VIDI program. The position in this call will focus on using Artificial Intelligence methods to track the politics of tracking climate change adaptation. The other PhD position will focus on conceptualizing and empirically investigating the politics of adaptation tracking using a primarily a qualitative approach.

For this PhD position “Artificial intelligence for tracking the politics of climate change adaptation”, you will:
Employ state-of-the art machine learning tools to develop evidence maps on what is already known about the politics of tracking policy for climate and other sustainability challenges
Develop and apply natural language processing methods to analyze the politics of tracking adaptation to climate change from a variety of sources (media, policy documents, minutes, speeches, etc.) at national and global levels
Co-organize and participate in workshops on the politics of adaptation tracking
Lead the development of 4 scientific publications which form the basis of your PhD dissertation. You will also be involved in developing program-level publications (as co-author)
Present your work at (inter)national scientific conferences and/or symposia
In addition to the other PhD candidate in this program, you will collaborate in Dr. Biesbroek’s research lab with ~10 other postdocs, PhD candidates, and research assistants working on climate change related topics. For this project you will also collaborate with Prof. Dr. Ioannis Athanasiadis (Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, Wageningen University) who will act as the second promotor in this PhD project.

Within the lab, the successful candidate will design, perform experiments, and develop new computational analysis tools to analyze her/his data.


Topic

The recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has shown how fragile humankind is when facing such highly infectious virus in absence of antiviral treatment. To establish a successful infection, SARS-CoV-2 must replicate and transcribe its genome very efficiently in the host cell. This task is performed by the replication-transcription complex, a multi-proteins complex formed of a polymerase and viral co-factors, which is a key target for antivirals. While cryo-electron microscopy has brought many high-resolution images of the complex in different compositions, functional studies are still lacking, impairing the precise characterization of the function of such complex during infection. The goal of this thesis is to decipher the mechanism of assembly of the replication-transcription complex and its regulation during viral RNA synthesis, providing new targets for the rational design of the antiviral drugs of the future.

Research Technician,"Are you motivated to contribute to a healthier tomorrow by finding new drug targets and ways to modulate these in cancer? Then join us at the Receptor Biochemistry and Signaling group of prof. Martine Smit within the Faculty of Science at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.


Location: AMSTERDAM

FTE: 0.8 - 1
Job description
Many of the drugs in use today work by molecularly targeting cell surface receptors. Yet our understanding of these systems is incomplete, meaning we can likely design better and more effective therapies in the future. In this position you have the unique opportunity to participate in innovative scientific research combining the latest developments in receptor and cell biology towards a therapeutic goal. In our group, we study human and viral chemokine receptors, members of the family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Our aim is to understand their role in healthy conditions (immune responses) as well as in pathologies like cancer (brain, breast, leukemia, colon). One of the ways we are investigating these GPCRs is by nanobodies, small Llama-derived antibody fragments which modulate receptor activity, that may hold important diagnostic and therapeutic value. Traditionally, drug development has viewed GPCRs as plasma membrane-bound, but we now believe they can also travel throughout the body, carried on extracellular vesicles (EVs). One of our research lines focusses on how this process occurs in disease and hence how we can re-design our pharmacological targeting to address this.

 In our research we use state-of-the art molecular pharmacological, cell biological and (molecular-) biochemical techniques, are located in a modern research environment (OI2) with excellent imaging facilities and have direct access to specialized groups at the Amsterdam UMC (Cancer Centre Amsterdam, Immunology). As a Research technician/Laboratory manager you will directly and actively contribute to our diverse research lines supporting the Postdocs and PhD students in the group.

As laboratory manager you will contribute to the stimulating, safe and productive work environment of the group. You will be responsible for the daily operations in the group, overseeing the lab efficiency, maintaining the general protocols, ordering supplies and safety.


Your duties
Participate in the research of the group; Cell culture, Protein purification (nanobodies), EV biology, Signal transduction assays, Molecular Pharmacology, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology.
Assistance in the practical course of the group and supervising students.
Coordination of the tasks to manage the laboratory/ research environment.
Requirements
HBO/MSc or higher in Molecular Pharmacology, (Bio)chemistry, or related fields.
Experience requested: Mammalian cell culture techniques, Biochemical techniques (molecular cloning, protein production, PCR, SDS-page/western blot).
Experience preferred: flow cytometry and gene editing of mammalian cells (CRISPR-Cas9 KO/KI), Molecular Pharmacology (binding, functional BRET/FRET-based), isolation and characterization of EVs, imaging.
Experience/skills to coordinate/participate in laboratory management and maintenance of databases/lab-infrastructure.
Affinity with the educational programs Pharmaceutical Sciences and Drug Discovery Sciences training VU students to develop into independent, academic, researchers.
Team player with an eye for detail, strong communicator, contributing to an optimal work environment.
What are we offering?
A challenging position in a socially involved organization. On full-time basis the remuneration amounts to a minimum gross monthly salary of €2,818 (scale 8) and a maximum €4,257 (scale 9), depending on your education and experience. The job profile research technician is based on the university job ranking system and is vacant for at least 0.8 FTE. The initial employment contract will affect a period of 1 year with the intention to become permanent.

The psychological literature on network modeling is growing rapidly, and Bayesian statistics offers concrete solutions to outstanding methodological problems (e.g., doi.org/10.1007/s11336-022-09861-x and psyarxiv.com/ub5tc). The network structure will be modeled with a graphical model or a Markov random field. The postdoc will develop a Bayesian methodology to assess structural changes in the network after an intervention and to model the influence of grouping or predictor variables. These variables may be observed, as in ANOVA and regression, or unobserved, as in mixture modeling or latent class analysis. After successfully deriving the Bayesian models and methodology, the candidate will implement the new methods in the open source statistical software R and JASP. In addition, the candidate will collaborate with the BGM lab on joint projects and help supervise Ph.D. students. The BGM lab will consist of two postdocs and three Ph.D students.

The BGM lab is part of the Psychological Methods Program Group at the University of Amsterdam, one of the largest and most successful research centers in psychological methods. Its main research areas are network analysis, Bayesian statistics, mathematical psychology, and psychometrics. In addition to developing novel research methods, we are actively developing psychological theory on several topics, including intelligence, psychopathology, and decision-making. The group is committed to open science and has made important methodological contributions over the past decade to facilitate transparent research practices.

What are you going to do
You will:
derive Bayes factors or Bayesian variable selection procedures to assess the impact of interventions and predictors on graphical models;
analyze the performance of proposed Bayesian solutions using formal methods and simulations;
implement the new Bayesian procedures in open source software such as R and JASP;
regularly present research results at (international) workshops and conferences and publish them in internationally renowned journals;
help supervise Ph.D. projects in the BGM lab.

Teaching is limited to 5% of the time, assisting in courses and supervising M.Sc. students. More teaching is possible if desired by the candidate.

What do we require
For these positions, you must have
a Ph.D. with a specialization in psychological methods, psychometrics, mathematical psychology, statistics, econometrics, or a related discipline;
hands-on experience in building Bayesian statistical models, especially Bayesian variable selection models;
hands-on experience with computational methods to evaluate Bayesian statistical models, e.g., Markov chain Monte Carlo methods;
excellent programming skills in R and C or C++;
excellent oral and written communication skills in English, as demonstrated by academic publications and presentations at international conferences;
a good publication record;
excellent interpersonal and organizational skills.

It is essential that you make Amsterdam (or a location within commuting distance) your primary residence for the duration of the postdoctoral project and that you are available to start between now and September 1, 2023.

It is desirable (but not essential) that you have
experience using JASP or programming in JASP;
experience with random graph models or graphical models.

Please note that knowledge of Dutch is not required for this position.

What can we offer you
The position concerns temporary employment of 38 hours per week. The initial employment is for one year. Following a positive assessment and barring altered circumstances, this term will be extended for one year to a total duration of two years. For this position, the University Job Classification profile 'onderzoeker 3' applies.

Salary depends on past education and relevant work experience, with a minimum salary of €3974 and a maximum salary of €5439 gross per month based on a full-time appointment for a 38-hour working week (in keeping with scale 11, as per the Collective Labor Agreement for Dutch Universities).

PhD on designing technologies to improve the social life of people with dementia,"Job description
Are you interested in designing meaningful interactive technologies through co-design and participatory design practices? Would you like to study how to improve the lives of people with dementia by promoting social connection with their family and social circle? If so, this PhD position at the Human-Technology Interaction group of Eindhoven University of Technology is for you.
As all human beings, people with dementia have a fundamental need for social belonging and connectedness with others. Yet, having dementia may disrupt their social relationships and diminish their capabilities to participate in society. This means that people with dementia are at risk of becoming socially isolated and disengaged, which might negatively affect their quality of life. This project will focus on developing a suite of technological tools that support people with dementia’s need for social contact by creating occasions of mutuality with others. In order to achieve this objective, the project sets itself to follow a person-centered co-design approach driven by the needs, desires, and dreams of people with dementia, and those surrounding them, and aimed at creating interactive technologies that could support people with dementia throughout their journey (at different stages and in different contexts).
YOUR DUTIES
The elicitation of needs, co-design of technologies, and the testing and evaluating of technologies, will be characterized by a sensitive and participatory approach. This means that people with dementia and their families are not merely seen as research participants, but rather as partners in the research and development process.
For this work package, two PhD candidates will collaborate closely together: one of them will focus on the behavioral aspects and psychological needs, whereas the other will focus on the design of suitable AI technologies and interventions that are aimed to meet those needs. The two PhDs will collaborate closely throughout the project.
Specific objectives for the PhD:
Review the current evidence-base on technology design in relation to social innovation and technologies in dementia care.
Perform field research to gather insights into the contexts and opportunities for supporting and enhancing social exchange, social relationships, social participation and social engagement in the lives of people with dementia.
Hold co-creation sessions with all involved stakeholders along the patient journey to gain insight and guide the design of the technologies for social engagement.
Design and test the co-created technologies with people with dementia, their spouses, families, informal and formal caregivers.

CONTEXT
This PhD position is part of the QoLEAD project – Quality of Life by use of Enabling AI in Dementia. QoLEAD is a new, NWO-funded research project, characterized by an interdisciplinary collaboration between several Dutch universities. Its unique focus at the intersection of healthcare and technology offers a challenging and inspiring work environment for ambitious PhD candidates. The entire project offers 8 PhD positions, spread across several work packages. As a PhD, you will work closely together with your work packages’ team, as well as with the entire QoLEAD team. The research will be done in a multi-disciplinary team divided between Eindhoven University of Technology (HTI group, IE&IS), Radboud University (UKON), and Tilburg University (Tranzo).

Your affiliation with Eindhoven University of Technology will give you the opportunity to be part of TU/e’s Expertise Center of Dementia and Technology (ECDT). The ECDT is an initiative of the TU/e and Alzheimer Nederland to positively change the lives of people with dementia through the use of Warm Technology. In this, we work together with healthcare organization, companies, researchers and citizens.

Job requirements
Have a MSc degree in Human-Technology Interaction, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science, Industrial Design, Human-Computer Interaction, or related field.
Have strong computational and design thinking skills, and a keen interest in co-design and participatory design practices.
Have affinity with (the care for) people with dementia and an innate capability to empathize with others and show warmheartedness.
Have a strong motivation to conduct research in a challenging, multidisciplinary environment.
Have high proficiency in spoken and written English,
Have high proficiency in spoken and written Dutch (as you will interact and design for Dutch-speaking people with dementia)
Conditions of employment
A meaningful job in a dynamic and ambitious university, in an interdisciplinary setting and within an international network. You will work on a beautiful, green campus within walking distance of the central train station. In addition, we offer you:
Full-time employment for four years, with an intermediate evaluation (go/no-go) after nine months. You will spend 10% of your employment on teaching tasks.
Salary and benefits (such as a pension scheme, paid pregnancy and maternity leave, partially paid parental leave) in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities, scale 27 (min. €2,541 max. €3,247).
A year-end bonus of 8.3% and annual vacation pay of 8%.

"JADS: PhD in Synergies between Platforms (1,0 fte)","Job description
Jheronimus Academy of Data Science (JADS) Den Bosch, is proud to start with three large Robust AI labs together with:
Deloitte (Auditing for Responsible AI Software Systems) – 5 PhD’s.
DPG Media (Responsible Media Lab) – 5 PhD’s in collaboration with UvA.
LaNubia (Innovation Lab for Utilities on Sustainable Technology and Renewable Energy) – 5 PhD’s.

JADS is seeking enthusiastic colleagues for the positions of PhD students. We operationalize the huge ambition around AI by explicitly aligning our research agenda on Robust AI with the United Nation’s sustainable development goals.
The project is funded in a public-private partnership by NWO/NLAIC and private partners. This position is part of the Responsible Media Lab.
Description of the Responsible Media Lab (run jointly by UvA, JADS and DPG Media)

How can AI contribute to the functioning of the media along the entire production chain (sourcing, production, distribution, engagement), and even fundamentally change aspects of the media as we know it? The lab will explore the potential of AI-driven solutions for the media, their professional role, opportunities for new business models and new ways of engaging with users, while taking into account professional values and the emerging regulatory framework for AI. The lab seeks to develop AI-based methods and solutions that facilitate more diverse news offerings to readers, working alongside human journalists.
The lab is a collaboration between UvA, JADS and DPG media and consists of 5 Ph.D. projects. All Ph.D. trajectories will focus on the development and evaluation of AI-based algorithms and tools to support responsible media production:
Transparency and Explainability of AI Systems and Decisions for News (UvA: Prof.dr. Natali Helberger).
Explaining Recommendations (UvA: Prof. dr. Maarten de Rijke, and JADS: dr.ir. Martijn Willemsen).
Synergies between Platforms (JADS: dr. Ksenia Podoynitsyna and dr. Alexander Vossen).
Network Perspective on the Content and User Behavior (JADS: dr. Ksenia Podoynitsyna and dr. Claudia Zucca).
Generating Content (UvA: dr. Vlad Niculae).

All the Ph.D. students will closely interact with each other as the projects are complementary: they focus on either generating or better understanding the content, fueling further platform functionalities, or understanding interactions with the users of the platforms. While project 1, 3 and 4 focus on different aspects of the socio-technical system, project 2 and 5 are more focused on specific algorithms.
Short Description of the Ph.D. project
Digital platforms are booming. This research project is done in collaboration with DPG Media which manages various platforms and content brands, sometimes with distinct business models.
Online scale matters when operating local and independent media. One way to achieve this scale and make the media more resilient is to run the different media types as a connected set of platforms. Taking care of network effects is critical when managing platforms: the idea of network effects is that as the number of participants on each side grows, so does the value of the same or another group of participants. The most basic version could be, e.g., the more users, the more valuable the media platform is for advertisers (cross-side network effects example). Network effects come in different types and sizes, and substantially shape both the value within a given platform and the synergies between platforms.
This project aims to identify and understand the implications of the dependencies both within and across the different platforms (e.g., different types of direct and indirect network effects, for example, not only driven by the sheer numbers of users but also by the variety of complementors, by their utility, as well as reputation and data models implemented on the platform). One of the research goals is to move beyond a simple userbase measurement of network effects and identify novel metrics for measuring network effects within and across platforms. Another goal is to find existing and help design new network effects. The studies’ results will allow DPG to predict new synergies across platforms and provide input for its recommender systems.
Job Description

You will work on this project in close collaboration with DPG Media, which is active in the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark and carries brands in television, radio, news, magazines, online services, and telco, all of them being run on a variety of media platforms and sometimes with distinct business models. Historically, most of these platforms were managed separately, hence identifying existing and potential demand and supply synergies and conflicts is particularly valuable. From the research perspective, this is an exceptional setting in which dynamics and interactions between various types of users, content, platforms, and business models can be uniquely explored. The research will employ a variety of analytical methods to identify existing synergies and conflicts in DPG Media's multiple platforms and will combine these methods with experiments to validate design of the potential platform-synergetic network effects.
This project is embedded in the Data Entrepreneurship unit of JADS, one of the three research units next to Data Governance and Data Analytics.

Job requirements
A (Research) master's degree in Management, Strategy, Entrepreneurship, Organization Studies, or a related discipline with a (very) strong quantitative focus, a master's degree in Computational Social Science, or a master’s degree (or an equivalent university degree) in Data Science or AI with a strong management and/or strategy focus on the application side.
A research-oriented attitude and track record of doing research (e.g. a master’s thesis).
Ability to work in a team and interest in collaborating with industrial partners.
Ability to communicate and translate the research results to practice.
Competence in R and/or Python; knowledge of Spark is a strong pre.
Academic curiosity and an interest to collaborate in a multidisciplinary context.
Conditions of employment
Being appointed at JADS provides a meaningful job in a dynamic and ambitious community of 2 universities. Based on the project, the candidate receives an appointment at TU/Eindhoven or Tilburg University.
As a PhD Student at JADS you will have a full-time employment for a total of four years, with an intermediate evaluation after nine months.

Postdoc in modelling innovative use scenarios for future domestic comfort,"Job description
Research project description
Will you join us in our pursuit towards carbon-free heating and cooling in urban areas? We look for an enthusiastic(postdoc) researcher to advance the use of building performance simulation with enriched and diversified user profiles.
Job description
User behaviour can be a barrier to achieving optimal CO2 reduction potential of the energy transition in the built environment. If not used appropriately, advanced energy systems may not achieve their potential, in some cases leading to increased rather than decreased energy demand for heating and cooling. This in turn can lead to decreased levels of acceptance of these solutions, and thus slow down the energy transition. On the other hand, behaviour change can also harbour significant potential for energy savings, for example in the form of changing conventions of comfort, that is not always tapped into in the design of future solutions. System engineers have difficulties integrating the dynamics of social change into their designs because they are not trained to anticipate the complex relations between (building) system design and user behaviour. Design support tools, e.g. based on building performance simulation, tend to assume typical or average users as starting point, thereby overlooking the needs of specific subgroups and well-documented phenomena such as the (p)rebound effect. This project will deploy advanced building performance simulations to explore optimization potential in considering (future) energy practices, based on data of actual residents, as well as out-of-the-box scenarios developed using creative methods.
This postdoc will work between the Building Performance group of the Department of the Built Environment and the Future Everyday group of the Industrial Design Department. The (intermediate) outcomes of the project will provide valuable insights for the modelling of consumer behaviour of heating systems, as well as for determining and optimizing demand side reduction potential, resulting in insights for system design and decision-making for energy-efficient retrofits.
This position and research project are made possible by the BEHeaT program initiated by the Eindhoven Institute for Renewable Energy Systems (EIRES). EIRES facilitates the collaborative development and swift deployment of new technologies and devices by bringing together TU/e researchers working on materials, systems, and processes for energy storage and conversion.
EIRES consists of collaborating research groups within TUe. These include over 140 researchers and more than 450 PhDs. EIRES brings these researchers together and creates new network connections between researchers and industry.
Within the focus area of energy transition in the built environment, a large-scale research program was recently launched. This program, BEHeaT, stands for Built Environment Heat Transition. The program is funded with TUe's own resources as well as contributions from industry. The research program has a pragmatic approach.
Within the BEHeaT program, research is conducted into the (further) development of various (new) materials, components and/or systems in relation to intelligent buildings, heat storage, heat networks and/or electricity grids. The focus is not only on physical materials, components and systems, but also on dynamic (predictive) models. We believe that in order to have impact, any research must take systems integration as its starting point. In addition, we believe that technology does not stand alone and should always be seen in relation to the (end) user. In this way, the impact of research results is increased.

Are you an aspiring scientist in the field of cognitive neuroscience, looking to start your academic career off right? Then join the world-renowned Donders Institute as a PhD candidate and work with top-notch experimental equipment to build computational models of body representation, both somatosensory and multisensory.

We are looking for a motivated PhD candidate with interest and expertise in building computational models of body representation, both somatosensory and multisensory.

You will be part of the ERC funded project 'The Body Positioning System: A GPS for somatosensory space'. The goal of the project is to uncover how the brain localises touch on a body whose three-dimensional posture changes from moment to moment (The Body Positioning System). How does the brain transform sensory input on the skin to a full-fledged three-dimensional body representation? To make headway on this fundamental question, we will use a variety of neuroscientific approaches, such as behavioural and M/EEG experiments that employ novel virtual reality and robot-based paradigms. We will also leverage several analytical tools, such as computational modelling and machine learning.

As a PhD candidate, you will design novel, real-world behavioural paradigms to measure tactile localisation in three-dimensional space. Importantly, you will then use computational modelling to characterise and identify the mechanisms underlying the localization behaviour. The goal of these models is to understand the transformations used by the Body Positioning System. Your work is likely to involve close collaboration with fellow members of the team, including colleagues from other departments at the Donders Institute. Project management, mentoring BSc and MSc students, and teaching-related tasks will also be part of your responsibilities.

We are looking for two motivated PhD candidates to perform model-driven studies of perception and action in naturalistic environments. You will participate in the NWO-funded project 'Understanding behaviour in the real world ‐ a naturalistic approach to Neuroscience'. The aim of this project is to use virtual reality, wearable technology, and methods from data science and artificial intelligence to connect laboratory findings with behaviour in the real world and to utilise the new neuroscience knowledge for clinical practice. The overarching focus will be on three behavioural pillars - walking, orienting and reaching - and compare their characteristics within the same normative framework to develop a data‐driven computational model for real‐world perception and action.

One PhD project ('Walking') will specifically focus on how real‐world statistics, motor predictions and sensory feedback are used in walking, and how these sensitivities differ in stroke patients, children and elderly. The other PhD project ('Reaching') focuses on how reaching and object interaction rely on adequate signals for task‐related, multi‐effector motor control. The real‐world complexity for signals computations has remained obscure and will be examined in healthy individuals and in patients with neurological disorders, such as stroke. For both projects, close collaboration will take place with colleagues from the Donders Institute, Radboud University's Institute for Computing and Information Sciences, and the Sint Maartenskliniek as clinical partner. Mentoring BSc and MSc students and teaching-related tasks will also be part of the candidates' responsibilities.

Your education task may be up to 10% of your appointment.

€ 3,974 - € 5,439
Deadline
15 Apr 2023

Population growth, technology dependency and increased global system complexity mean that we are at catastrophic risk from volcanic eruptions. Yet, global preparedness to the impacts of multi- and cascading hazards caused by moderate to large scale volcanic eruptions is lacking, with eruptions capable of far-reaching impacts that would require a rapid and coordinated national and international response. The project “Global response, vulnerability and preparedness to volcanic, cross-border multi-hazards” will address this gap and the societal challenge of building disaster resilience societies to volcanic hazards.

You will design an operational framework for the communication for global volcanic hazards and risk and work towards the development of a holistic assessment tool for the determination of volcanic risk to society at global scale. The project will use a multi-disciplinary approach, combining volcanology, geospatial modelling using both structured and unstructured (crowdsourced) data to a) identify present vulnerability and direct and cascading social, economic and environmental risks from volcanic multi-hazards (primary and secondary) for different magnitude eruptions, and b) provide recommendations and a road map for improvements in the communication of global volcanic hazards and risk.

You will work on partnership mapping and engagement (e.g., co-creation activities) and conduct collaborative research with relevant sectors and disciplines. You will carry out crowdsourced data mining and will also work on the development of existing multi-hazard risk analysis tools using diverse sources of geospatial data. You will interpretate and communicate of results to a range of interested parties. You will also contribute to CDR activities and GeoAcademy short courses in volcanic hazards and geoscience communication that are currently being developed.

Your profile
Completed a PhD in Geography, Environmental Science, Geoscience, Social Science or a related discipline

"Postdoc position in Digital Humanities, ERC StG/NWO Vidi Project ""Exiled Empiricists""","Tilburg University | Tilburg School of Humanities and Digital Sciences Postdoc position in Digital Humanities, ERC StG/NWO Vidi Project “Exiled Empiricists”

Department : Department of Philosophy
Location : Tilburg
Full time equivalent : 0,8 – 1,0 fte (32-40 hours per week)
Monthly full-time salary : € 2.960 - € 4.670
Duration of employment contract : 2 years (based on 1,0 fte)
The Department of Philosophy at Tilburg University seeks to appoint a postdoctoral researcher (2-3 years, 0.8-1,0 fte) in the ERC StG/NWO Vidi project “Exiled Empiricists: American Philosophy and the Great Intellectual Migration”. Starting date: September or October 2023.

Job description
The postdoc’s primary responsibility will be to contribute to a quantitative study of the development of American philosophy in the decades before and after World War II (working packages A1-A3 of the ERC research project, description below) and to publish in peer reviewed journals and books. The researcher should also contribute to the project in other ways, such as by giving conference presentations, (co-)editing a special issue, and (co-)organizing reading groups and workshops. Furthermore, the researcher will be a member of the Tilburg Center for Moral Philosophy, Epistemology and Philosophy of Science (TiLPS) and contribute to its colloquia and seminars. You will be working in a stimulating and dynamic interdisciplinary research environment. You will work in close collaboration with the project’s principal investigator and have regular team meetings with the other members of the group.

The project
Exiled Empiricists: American Philosophy and the Great Intellectual Migration
The Exiled Empiricists project is funded by the European Research Council (ERC) and the Dutch Research Council (NWO) and led by Sander Verhaegh within the Tilburg Center for Moral Philosophy, Epistemology and Philosophy of Science (TiLPS), Tilburg University. The project currently employs three postdocs, a research assistant, and an external Ph.D. member.

Summary: In the 1930s, hundreds of European academics fled to the United States, escaping the quickly deteriorating political situation on the continent. Among them were a few dozen philosophers from a variety of schools: logical empiricists, critical theorists, and phenomenologists. Especially the first group would have a tremendous impact on American philosophy. Whereas the local intellectual climate had been dictated by American traditions like pragmatism, U.S. philosophers soon began to advance views that were heavily indebted to the empiricists. In fact, much of academic philosophy today is still shaped by the discussions and practices first instigated in this disruptive period.

Although historians have reconstructed the fate of the exiled empiricists, little attention has been paid to the American context in which their movement came to full bloom. This is surprising, since any account of the empiricists’ success requires an explanation of why the Americans were so receptive to their views. To what extent did developments in American philosophy pave the way for logical empiricism? And why was the American community more receptive to empiricism than to critical theory or phenomenology? This project shifts the perspective from the refugees to the local philosophical climate by 1) quantitatively analyzing thousands of American journal publications and 2) qualitatively examining the archives of dozens of key American philosophers and institutions.

A more detailed description of the project, including the working packages A1-A3 (to which the postdoctoral researcher will contribute), can be found on the project website.

Requirements position
We are looking for a postdoctoral researcher who satisfies the following requirements:
A completed PhD in philosophy, computer science, history, computational linguistics or a related field.

Challenge: Generate realistic multimodal behavior for digital humans

Change: Incorporate causal factors dictating social dynamics

Impact: Immersive social XR for education, healthcare, and workplace
Job description
Recent advances in extended reality (virtual/augmented/mixed reality) and artificial intelligence have catalyzed a growing interest in using machine learning methods for the generation of realistic 3D digital humans with believable behaviors. While much progress has been made in achieving spectacular visual realism of synthetic digital humans, the generated behaviors remain far from believable, especially in social contexts. This is because recent work has largely focused on synthesizing digital individuals or their behavioral aspects in isolation. Consequently, a few crucial questions remain: how do we incorporate partner behaviors and social contextual information such as cultural backgrounds and beliefs into generative machine learning models? How do we evaluate the perception and appropriateness of the synthesized artifacts within the context of social outcomes? Exploring such questions requires an understanding of how we coordinate subtle behavioral cues across the visual, vocal, and verbal modalities to express our beliefs, desires, and intents.

We are looking for an enthusiastic, self-motivated person to come work with us on synthesizing and evaluating realistic multimodal social behavior towards not only developing socially-aware autonomous 3D digital humans, but also advancing our understanding of social cognition in real humans. The project will involve incorporating theories and insights from social cognition into deep generative representation learning techniques. Specifically, the project will delve into discovering and integrating causal behavioral patterns into the generation process. Further, the project will also involve using synthetic humans and behavior data to support theory building in the social sciences. Consequently, this endeavor bridges concepts across several disciplines, including multimodal machine learning, vision/graphics, speech, cognitive neuroscience, and social psychology.

We offer a dynamic, stimulating, and diverse research environment. You will work within the Pattern Recognition and Bioinformatics group within the Department of Intelligent Systems, which includes researchers working on the methodology of machine learning, socially perceptive computing, and computer vision. You will be advised by Chirag Raman.
Requirements
We are looking for a candidate that meets the following criteria:

A critical thinker with an open mind to draw upon ideas and research methodologies from different disciplines
A strong interest in understanding and developing statistical and machine learning methods applied to human behavior data in social, interactive contexts
A Master's degree or equivalent, or about to graduate with one, in a relevant computational field such as computer science, computer vision / graphics, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, etc.
An ability to program in Python, C, C++, C#, or similar programming language
Proficiency in spoken and written English (at the B2 level or equivalent)

The following skills are nice to have:

Experience with pytorch
Experience with 3D content authoring tools and associated programming languages (e.g. Blender, Unity, Unreal, Maya, etc.)
Experience designing experiments with human participants

The topic is inherently interdisciplinary, so we encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet all criteria as long as you are willing to acquire the required complementary skills.

Doing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and a final thesis. For more details please check the Graduate Schools Admission Requirements.
Conditions of employment

Faculty Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science
The Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS) brings together three scientific disciplines. Combined, they reinforce each other and are the driving force behind the technology we all use in our daily lives. Technology such as the electricity grid, which our faculty is helping to make completely sustainable and future-proof. At the same time, we are developing the chips and sensors of the future, whilst also setting the foundations for the software technologies to run on this new generation of equipment – which of course includes AI. Meanwhile we are pushing the limits of applied mathematics, for example mapping out disease processes using single cell data, and using mathematics to simulate gigantic ash plumes after a volcanic eruption. In other words: there is plenty of room at the faculty for ground-breaking research. We educate innovative engineers and have excellent labs and facilities that underline our strong international position. In total, more than 1000 employees and 4,000 students work and study in this innovative environment.

PhD Active and passive states in human working memory,"The University of Groningen is a research university with a global outlook, deeply rooted in Groningen, City of Talent. Quality has had top priority for four hundred years, and with success: the University is currently in or around the top 100 on several influential ranking lists.

The Faculty of Behavioural and Social Sciences excels in teaching and research in the fields of human behaviour, thinking, learning, and how people live together. The Faculty of Behavioural and Social Sciences employs over 800 staff members. Within the Faculty, the Department of Psychology offers Bachelor’s and Master’s programs in both Dutch and English to over 3,000 students. Our department's student population is very international; more than half of our students are non-Dutch.

The group of Experimental Psychology pursues a research program focused on the cognitive underpinnings of human behaviour, as well as their neurophysiological correlates. We teach in the Psychology Bachelor program, and also in the top-rated Behavioural and Cognitive Neurosciences (BCN) Research Master, the Computational Cognitive Science Master, and the Applied Cognitive Neuroscience Master.

This PhD project focuses on how the brain maintains information in working memory. This short-term store of information is vital to adaptive, intelligent behaviour. For long it was assumed that working memory is implemented by persistent neural activity; by neurons that keep firing in order to keep the maintained information active. However, more recent work has demonstrated that information can also be maintained in an activity-silent way involving short-term synaptic plasticity. Yet, the functional role of these silent mechanisms is unknown. In this project, using a novel impulse-perturbation technique that is able to illuminate activity-silent states using EEG, you will investigate 1) whether there are functional differences to information that is maintained using persistent-activity or in an activity-silent way, and 2) what the advantages are of having two different ways to code memories. These studies will provide a more detailed account of how working memory supports intelligent behaviour in- and outside the laboratory.

The tasks of the PhD candidate are:
conduct research that results in a dissertation, in line with the objectives and requirements of the projectorganize and execute the data collection for the different studiespublish the results of the research in international scientific journalspresent the research findings to fellow scientists and developerscollaborate with other team membersprovide a limited amount of teaching at the Psychology department, such as small-scale tutorials, guest lectures and student supervision, in collaboration with the supervisors.
