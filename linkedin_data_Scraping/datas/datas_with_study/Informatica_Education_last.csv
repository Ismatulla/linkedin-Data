The Context

The Computer Science department of the University of Twente is expanding. Therefore, we are hiring 6 new faculty members, to strengthen our research in Artificial Intelligence, Cyberphysical systems and Software Engineering in the domains of (1) e-Health and (2) energy and sustainability. These new faculty members will be assigned in different research groups, but inter-group collaboration with other researchers working on these themes is considered essential to reach our overall ambitions. One of the six positions is in the Formal Methods and Tools group (FMT) and focusses on research in energy and sustainability.


The Position

The Formal Methods and Tools group develops and implements mathematical methods, high-performance data structures and algorithms, and suitable programming languages for the design of reliable software- and data-intensive control systems. One important aspect that we would like to consider more prominently in our work is the energy consumption of such systems. Therefore, we are looking for somebody with expertise on energy-efficient software development. Areas that we are interested in are for example the modelling of energy usage of software (possibly considering different hardware models for execution), techniques to estimate the energy consumption of software, and techniques that can be used to (automatically) reduce the energy consumption of software. We are interested in integrating such techniques in many of the techniques that we develop within FMT. We also are interested in collaborating with the other groups within the CS department on this topic.


The Formal Methods and Tools group is an internationally well-known group of researchers in the area of formal methods and software engineering. Their research covers a wide range of different tools and techniques. The group is quickly growing: it currently consists of 4 full-time full professors, 2 associate professors and 8 assistant professors. In addition, several part-time full professors are associated to the group. The FMT group has an open and welcoming atmosphere, where there is room for both scientific and social interactions.

You have a PhD degree in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or related discipline;
You have demonstrated the ability to perform high-quality research in a field relevant to the theme of energy and sustainability and to research done in the FMT group;
You have shown a willingness to acquire external funding and are prepared to expand your skills in this respect;
You have good communication skills and are a team player;
You are fluent in English (knowledge of, or willingness to learn Dutch is an advantage);
You have a University Teaching Qualification (Dutch: BKO) or equivalent, or you are willing to acquire one within three years.
Our offer
We offer a permanent position with a one-year probationary period (formally a 1-year contract with prospect of permanent contract).
The position comes with a start-up package that will be allow you to appoint one PhD student.
Our terms of employment are in accordance with the Dutch Collective Labor Agreement for Universities (CAO) and include a holiday allowance of 8% of the gross annual salary and a year-end bonus of 8.3%.
Depending on your relevant background and experience, the gross monthly salary on a full-time basis ranges from € 3974,- (scale 11) to € 7362,- (scale 14) gross per month.
A minimum of 29 leave days in case of full-time employment based on a formal workweek of 38 hours. A fulltime employment in practice means 40 hours a week, therefore resulting in 96 extra leave hours on an annual basis.
A solid pension scheme.
Free access to sport facilities on campus.
We are a family-friendly institution, which offers parental leave for both parents (both paid and unpaid) and career support for partners.
We appreciate diversity of profiles, cultures, and backgrounds, and promote an inclusive working culture.
Furthermore, we offer excellent professional and personal development programs.
Finally, you will work in a lively, inspiring, and dynamic working environment in an organization focusing on internationalization, where you will have a high degree of responsibility and independence.

Are you interested in studying networks and using methodology at the cross-section of business analytics, econometrics and computer science? The Business Analytics section at the University of Amsterdam Business School invites applications for a PhD position in Network Statistics and Machine Learning. We are looking for candidates with the ambition to work and succeed at the highest international academic level.

The main topic of research is network analysis and modelling using statistical and machine learning tools. Network data are ubiquitous in finance, social media, the economy, and business. Social networks play an increasingly important role in society. For example, the Reddit community WallStreetBets hyped the stock of GameStop (GME), causing a short squeeze and extremely volatile stock prices in early 2021. Similarly, statements made on social networks such as Twitter have been shown to impact public and voter opinions. Exemplifying how social networks directly affect the economy, this project focusses on studying network data with a specific interest in modelling and understanding how networks change over time. Change detection in an online fashion is a challenging task in networks of large size, a common property of social networks.

In this research, the candidate will first investigate and develop interpretable network analysis approaches using statistical models and test them on real-life data. Then geometric deep learning approaches for the tasks like node classification, link prediction and graph classification will be developed with change detection ability. In the final phase of the project, the candidate should bring together two families of methods and design an optimized algorithm that is both interpretable and yields a high performance in network change detection.

The PhD student will work in close collaboration with the supervisory team and other faculty on the tasks.
The supervisory team will consist of dr. Inez Zwetsloot (ABS), dr. Simon Trimborn (ASE) and dr. Stevan Rudinac (ABS).

What are you going to do?

Develop novel interpretable statistical models for network analysis;
develop novel deep-learning approaches for node classification, link prediction, and community detection in network data;
create open data and software tools for the envisioned network analysis tasks;
present research findings at international conferences;
write up findings for publication in international journals;

Good command of Dutch and excellent command of English.
Faculty criteria for appointment at the level of assistant professor are available upon request but minimally include having completed a PhD and having approximately 10 international peer reviewed publications.


Given the extensive collaboration with both international as well as Dutch partners, a good command of Dutch language is required for the position. Since this appointment is intended to result in a tenured position, strong candidates who can convincingly argue that they will be able to master a good working level of Dutch in a relatively short period of time (e.g. through having lived/worked/studied in the Netherlands or having mastered a similar foreign language before) are welcome to apply.
What are we offering
A challenging position from Assistant Professor 2 to Assistant Professor 1 in a socially involved organization. On full-time basis the remuneration amounts to a minimum gross monthly salary of €3,974 (scale 11) and a maximum of €5,439 (scale 11), depending on your education and experience. The job profile: Assistant Professor 2 is based on the university job ranking system and is vacant for at least 0.8 FTE.


We offer 2 types of contract. For candidates already living in the Netherlands, we offer a permanent position after 18 months, after a successful evaluation in your 15th month. After a successful evaluation, a path will be outlined for future academic development.

PhD position on Integrated symbolic AI and machine learning,"Job description
Machine learning is widely used for optimizing modern digital systems, addressing our inability to model these systems from first principles due to their complexity and the high dimensional data they generate. However, machine learning models, such as neural networks, often contain millions of parameters, making it difficult to understand their behavior and to trust their output. Moreover, they require large amounts of labeled data, which is not always available. There are machine learning approaches targeting these challenges (e.g. surrogate modeling or unsupervised learning), but they are often limited in their application. Symbolic AI approaches, on the other hand, are often explainable and can leverage expert knowledge to deal with few labeled samples, but struggle with noisy and high dimensional data.

This position is funded by the AIMS5.0 European project aiming to develop AI-enabled hardware and software components and systems across the whole industrial value chain to increase the overall efficiency and sustainability. The project has 53 industrial and academic partners. The role of the TUE is to develop AI enabled holistic planning and scheduling methods that will adapt to the current and anticipated state of the manufacturing processes and the supply chain. The use cases
of our industrial partners include adapting the product specification to the available resources, adapting planning of manufacturing processes to bottlenecks along the supply chain, optimizing the manufacturing processes for low batch sizes of custom products, and improving traceability and root cause analysis in incident management.

The TUE is participating with the Computer Science and the Industrial Engineering departments, with 3 PhD and 1 Postdoc position. This PhD position is at the Computer Science department.

extracted information and expert knowledge provided by the industrial partners by means of knowledge graphs) to address various planning, scheduling and optimization problems in complex industrial systems.

The successful candidate for this position is expected to:
Contribute to performing scientific research on integrated symbolic AI and machine learning in general, and to validate the results in the AIMS5.0 project.
Contribute to publishing results at (international) conferences and journals.
Collaborate with the other PhD and Postdoc researchers in this project.
Collaborate with other group and faculty members.
Collaborate with selected AIMS5.0 project partners, attend project meetings and contribute to deliverables and project outcome.
Assist with educational tasks (e.g. support lab/course assignments and/or supervise (under)graduate/internships students).
Job requirements
You have a Master degree in Computer Science, (Applied) Mathematics, Information Technologies, or a related field.
You have a experience with data driven methods (e.g. machine learning, statistics, stochastics) and/or knowledge driven methods (e.g. logic programming, deductive databases, automated reasoning, expert systems).
You have good programming skills and experience.
You have good communication skills and are eager to work as part of a research team.

The arts and entertainment sectors, part of the creative and cultural industries, are characterized by a complex web of patterns of influence. These influence patterns can take many forms, such as the transfer of ideas and techniques between different (artistic) disciplines, the adoption of (aesthetic) styles and trends by different artists and organizations, and the flow of resources and funding between different sectors. One of the key ways in which influence operates is through the fashioning, dissemination, and adoption of creative ideas. This means that influence relations are often characterized by a high degree of cross-pollination, with ideas and trends flowing freely between different sectors or disciplines. By examining the influence patterns between different cultural and creative disciplines - the data can take the form of text, static images, and/or video - we can better understand the mechanisms that drive the flow of ideas and techniques across diverse domains and identify the (key) drivers of innovation within and across sectors. For instance, directors and writers in the movie/TV industry may borrow elements from other films, art, or books to create new and original stories. Similarly, in the music industry, artists and musicians may draw inspiration from a wide range of sources, including other genres of music, art forms, and even technology. Blending different styles and influences can create new and innovative works and/or expand upon existing artistic traditions. Overall, the patterns of influence within the arts and entertainment industries are intricate, with new trends and styles emerging all the time. By studying these influence patterns, we can understand the factors that drive innovation and success within these industries, which may provide greater insights into how these factors can be harnessed to support entrepreneurship and growth. In addition, studying the influence relations can also shed light on the broader sociocultural forces that shape these industries, such as the role of entrepreneurs, cultural institutions, and commercial enterprises, the impact of technological innovation, and the influence of global trends and market forces.

This interdisciplinary project aims to better understand the factors that can explain innovation and entrepreneurial projects' success (and failures) by applying advanced computational machine learning approaches.

During your PhD, you will be trained to conduct quantitative empirical research aimed at advancing business and computer science research in top-tier academic journals and conferences. You will also be a member of a newly formed research lab: the Creative Industries (CI) Lab. As a member of the CI Lab within the Entrepreneurship and Innovation department, you will benefit from, and contribute to, the research agenda, networks, initiatives, resources, and the collegial environment in that Lab, as well as have the liberty to join one or more ongoing research projects carried out by members of our department.

Challenge: Generate realistic multimodal behavior for digital humans

Change: Incorporate causal factors dictating social dynamics

Impact: Immersive social XR for education, healthcare, and workplace
Job description
Recent advances in extended reality (virtual/augmented/mixed reality) and artificial intelligence have catalyzed a growing interest in using machine learning methods for the generation of realistic 3D digital humans with believable behaviors. While much progress has been made in achieving spectacular visual realism of synthetic digital humans, the generated behaviors remain far from believable, especially in social contexts. This is because recent work has largely focused on synthesizing digital individuals or their behavioral aspects in isolation. Consequently, a few crucial questions remain: how do we incorporate partner behaviors and social contextual information such as cultural backgrounds and beliefs into generative machine learning models? How do we evaluate the perception and appropriateness of the synthesized artifacts within the context of social outcomes? Exploring such questions requires an understanding of how we coordinate subtle behavioral cues across the visual, vocal, and verbal modalities to express our beliefs, desires, and intents.

We are looking for an enthusiastic, self-motivated person to come work with us on synthesizing and evaluating realistic multimodal social behavior towards not only developing socially-aware autonomous 3D digital humans, but also advancing our understanding of social cognition in real humans. The project will involve incorporating theories and insights from social cognition into deep generative representation learning techniques. Specifically, the project will delve into discovering and integrating causal behavioral patterns into the generation process. Further, the project will also involve using synthetic humans and behavior data to support theory building in the social sciences. Consequently, this endeavor bridges concepts across several disciplines, including multimodal machine learning, vision/graphics, speech, cognitive neuroscience, and social psychology.

We offer a dynamic, stimulating, and diverse research environment. You will work within the Pattern Recognition and Bioinformatics group within the Department of Intelligent Systems, which includes researchers working on the methodology of machine learning, socially perceptive computing, and computer vision. You will be advised by Chirag Raman.
Requirements
We are looking for a candidate that meets the following criteria:

A critical thinker with an open mind to draw upon ideas and research methodologies from different disciplines
A strong interest in understanding and developing statistical and machine learning methods applied to human behavior data in social, interactive contexts
A Master's degree or equivalent, or about to graduate with one, in a relevant computational field such as computer science, computer vision / graphics, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, etc.
An ability to program in Python, C, C++, C#, or similar programming language
Proficiency in spoken and written English (at the B2 level or equivalent)

The following skills are nice to have:

Experience with pytorch
Experience with 3D content authoring tools and associated programming languages (e.g. Blender, Unity, Unreal, Maya, etc.)
Experience designing experiments with human participants

The topic is inherently interdisciplinary, so we encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet all criteria as long as you are willing to acquire the required complementary skills.

Doing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and a final thesis. For more details please check the Graduate Schools Admission Requirements.
Conditions of employment
Doctoral candidates will be offered a 4-year period of employment in principle, but in the form of 2 employment contracts.

The Context

The Computer Science department of the University of Twente is expanding. Therefore, we are hiring 6 new faculty members, to strengthen our research in Artificial Intelligence, Cyberphysical systems and Software Engineering in the domains of (1) e-Health and (2) energy and sustainability. These new faculty members will be assigned in different research groups, but inter-group collaboration with other researchers working on these themes is considered essential to reach our overall ambitions. One of the six positions is in the Human Media Interaction (HMI) group and focusses on research in e-Health.


The Position

Research into multimodal conversational systems such as chatbots, virtual humans, or social robots to coach people to live a healthier lifestyle, both from a physical and mental perspective, has seen a steady growth in the past couple of years. With the introduction of conversational systems such as ChatGPT and Bard, it looks as if smooth natural language conversations with an AI system have become possible. However, lifestyle coaching systems need a more sensitive and controlled mechanism to decide on what personalized advice to give. They need to be sensitive to the possibly vulnerable physical and mental state of the user and be aware of the possible effects of their advice. Furthermore, the information they provide should be communicated in a convincing way, but also be reliable and trustworthy. We are looking for a candidate with an AI background that can contribute to intelligent systems that can realise these goals.

Human Media Interaction (HMI) is a diverse and interdisciplinary research group that studies and designs interactive systems that users can intuitively interact with, ranging from Brain Computer Interfaces to Conversational Systems and Ambient Intelligence applications. In the area of Conversational Systems, HMI has expertise on speech technology, dialogue systems, embodied conversational agents and social robots. On the theme of e-Health, HMI has a strong tradition in contributing to a variety of coaching systems such as applications to increase physical fitness, advice on particular conditions (asthma, diabetes), or helping people to stop smoking or drinking. Research is conducted in coalitions with other research groups from inside and outside the University of Twente and with external stakeholders such as hospitals, rehabilitation centers, elderly homes, etcetera.

Job description
Extended Reality (XR) technologies, such as Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Mixed Reality, provide new possibilities for studying pedestrian behavior. An increasing number of studies have shown that XR can be a valuable addition to the current experimental methods to study pedestrian behavior. Different XR technologies have distinct features regarding immersion, presence, and interaction capabilities. Research shows that the differences among XR technologies might cause people to perceive the virtual environment and behave differently, which ultimately has an impact on the collected behavioral data via XR. Thus, it is crucial to investigate these differences and understand the suitability of different XR technologies for pedestrian behavior study.

In this PhD project, you will be working on understanding the suitability of applying different XR technologies (i.e., VR, AR, and MR) to study pedestrian behavior. You will create novel metrics from the perspective of pedestrian behavior and human-computer interaction to evaluate the usage of different XR technologies for pedestrian behavior study. It will be done via quantitative and qualitative comparison of different XR technologies from different perspectives, in particular concerning validity, effectiveness, applicability, and level of presence. You will investigate this by developing different XR applications, setting up experiments, as well as collecting and analyzing behavior and physiological data. You will be collaborating with other members of the MXR Lab that work on related projects (e.g., wayfinding behavior, evacuation behavior).
Requirements
We are looking for an enthusiastic and ambitious candidate with the following qualifications, knowledge, and skills:

A master’s degree (or equivalent) in computer science, human-computer interaction, or related fields.
A solid background and strong interest in XR technologies and skills in developing XR applications using Unity/Unreal game engine.
Strong and demonstrable experimental skills including experiment design, experiment setup, conducting experiments, and data collection.
Experience in serious game development is appreciated.
Strong analytic and programming skills (e.g., Python, C#) with proficiency in statistics
An open-minded personality with a curiosity-driven mindset, positive attitude towards methodological and interdisciplinary research, and willingness to learn from different fields, including transportation, human-computer interaction, and urban planning.
Prior research and work experience that is relevant to this PhD position is a bonus.
Good communication and writing skills in English

Doing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and a final thesis.

PhD Candidate, Interpretable causal machine learning for intervention development from wearable sensors data
Vacancy number: 23-204


Key responsibilities
We are looking for an excellent candidate with a master’s degree in MSc in Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science, Mathematics, Statistics, or a closely related field to join a project focused on health intervention development using wearable sensing technologies.
We would like to understand how 24/7 observational activity data collected by wearable sensors (e.g., smart watches) and causal machine learning techniques (casual discovery and causal inference) can be used to identify and recommend effective changes in daily activities (i.e., possible behavioral interventions) that are expected to result in concrete health improvements. Available machine learning techniques are not able to fully identify causal mechanisms from observational data. Within this project our goal is to develop algorithms for finding causal relations which subsequently can be the starting point for effective interventions and inferring the impact of behavioural changes.
This project is defined within the LABDA (Learning Network for Advanced Behavioural Data Analysis) European project:
LABDA is an EU-funded Marie Sklodowska Curie Action (MSCA) Doctoral Network, that brings together leading researchers in advanced movement behaviour data analysis at the intersection of data science, method development, epidemiology, public health, and wearable technology to train a new generation of creative and innovative public health researchers via training-through-research. The main aims of LABDA are to establish novel methods for advanced 24/7 movement behaviour data analysis of sensor-based data, examine the added value of advanced behavioural data analysis and multi-modal data for predicting health risk and facilitate the use and interpretability of the advanced methods for application in science, policy and society. Via training-through-research projects, 13 doctoral fellows will contribute to reaching these aims. Together, they will develop a joint taxonomy to enable interoperability and data harmonisation. Results will be combined in an open-source LABDA toolbox of advanced analysis methods, including a decision tree to guide researchers and other users to the optimal method for their (research) question. The open-source toolbox of advanced analysis methods will lead to optimized, tailored public health recommendations, and improved personal wearable feedback concerning 24/7 movement behaviour. For more information, see the project’s website: labdaproject.eu
As a doctoral fellow/PhD candidate within this project your specific responsibilities will be to
Perform research in causal discovery with the goal of developing methods to identify possible interventions from observational 24/7 movement behaviour time-series data;Perform research in counterfactual prediction and developing a framework for counterfactual prediction from 24/7 movement behaviour time-series data;Enhance the robustness of counterfactual prediction methods 24/7 movement time-series data;Report on findings by publishing scientific articles, resulting in a dissertation;Present findings at (inter)national meetings/conferences;Collaborate and exchange knowledge and skills with the other LABDA fellows;Contribute to the LABDA toolbox of advanced analysis methods for sensor-based behavioural data;Contribute to educational activities of the department and within the consortium.
Selection Criteria

Assistant/Associate Professor Causal Reinforcement Learning,"Assistant/Associate Professor Causal Reinforcement Learning
 Apply Now
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are literally changing the world. However, many AI and ML techniques employ statistical models that do not take this into account. This can lead to a plethora of problems, of which performance lower than expected is perhaps the most benign. In contrast, causal models try and capture the true effect of interventions or ‘actions’, while reinforcement learning deals with understanding the long-term outcomes of such actions over time. Will you build on these techniques to set up a research program on how intelligent systems can better understand the true outcome of their actions and predictions?

 Apply Now
Challenge: Transforming global risk indicators, PCR analyses of sewage samples from international means of transport, and local activity profiles into early-warning indicators for disease spread.
Job description
The COVID-19 pandemic has clearly shown that when information on disease spread is available early, more effective policy measures can be taken. Right now, the prevalence of a disease is only visible when the number of symptomatic patients rises above a certain threshold or when hospitalizations go up. At that moment, it is already quite late to apply effective interventions. PCR-testing of sewage samples has shown to be a good indicator of the spread of a disease in earlier stages, but we want to move even earlier than that. Most diseases enter the country via persons or animals travelling through transport hubs such as ports, airports, and major train stations. When applying the sampling of sewage to ships, airplanes, and trains, it might be possible to get an indication of the entrance of a pathogen into the country much earlier.

Erasmus Medical Center, TU Delft and Erasmus University Rotterdam have joined forces in the Pandemic and Disaster Preparedness Center (PDPC) to address complex interdisciplinary problems like this. PDPC aims to prepare society for future pandemics and disasters. We will reduce vulnerabilities and risks and build resilience through effective disaster prevention, preparedness and recovery measures. Convergence of the technical, medical and social sciences is essential for developing the next generation of approaches to disasters and pandemics. In the foreseeable future, our society can expect many more and unforeseen virus outbreaks and extreme events because of climate change. But how do we protect society from the next pandemic or disaster? Which of the lessons learnt could develop prevention and intervention measures, and how could research contribute to preparedness?

The INSPECT project of the PDPC studies integrated early warning surveillance tools and methods to detect possible disease outbreaks as early as possible. Within the project we aim to identify and characterize critical nodes in the complex global transport network for the emergence and dissemination of new viruses. Using rapid deployable and innovative sampling and detection methods we will further investigate these critical nodes.

As a PhD student on the project, you will work on the following aspects: (1) constructing a global flow-based transport model that can predict when and where travellers, crew and animals originating or passing through countries of concern will enter The Netherlands; (2) constructing a local activity-based transport model that predicts what the most likely locations are for travellers who used a transport means where a disease was found in the sewage after testing; (3) studying ways of real-time visualization, explainability and ethical aspects of the proposed models; (4) testing the models on simulated data at the start of the project and on actual data in the final stages of the project.

As a data-science and simulation-oriented PhD candidate at TU Delft, you will work closely together with PhD candidates on virology at EUR and Erasmus Medical Center, a PhD candidate on the development of surveillance and measuring tools at Civil Engineering at TU Delft, a Researcher on Ethical aspects of these types of surveillance systems, and a researcher who is responsible for the translation of the results to practice. A ""Living Lab"", probably in the Port of Rotterdam, will be available for development and testing.

This PhD research project will take place in the Policy Analysis group of the Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management of TU Delft. The research group has a long history in logistics and transportation simulation, as well as activity-based virus spread modelling. The group uses System Dynamics, discrete-event simulation, and agent-based modelling, as well as data analytics tools for this type of research. Several open-source simulation tools developed in Java and Python, and several open data sources are available as a starting point for the research.
Requirements
We are looking for someone who has:
An MSc degree in computer science, mathematics, econometrics, artificial intelligence, systems engineering, transport modelling, logistics, or in a comparable program.Demonstrable experience with simulation models and data analytics.Experience in gathering and analysing large data sets from databases or the Web.Programming experience, preferably in object-oriented environments such as Java or Python.Good social and communication skills; Excellent report writing and presentation skills; please visit https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/phd/admission for more information about the admission requirements.Good time management and organisational skills. Inquisitive, reflective and eager to grow;Excellent command of the English language, and willing to learn Dutch when required.We expect dedication and enthusiasm for innovative research, combined with scientific curiosity and the capacity for teamwork in an interdisciplinary environment.
Note that the intended starting date can be August or September 2023, so you can apply if you finalize your MSc program this Summer.
