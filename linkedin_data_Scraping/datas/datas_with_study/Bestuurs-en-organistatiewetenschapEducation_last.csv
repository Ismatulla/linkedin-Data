Developing organizational arrangements for artificial intelligence in public surveillance
Job description
We are looking for an enthusiastic PhD candidate with a background in the field of policy analysis, public administration, policy sciences or a related field to study and develop organizational implementation arrangements for Artificial Intelligence (AI) for regulatory surveillance. The position is a for 4-year PhD track, financed by the Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management, department of Multi-Actor Systems in close collaboration with regulatory agencies.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly used in regulatory processes. No wonder, AI promises a more effective regulatory supervision process, in which inspectors on the floor are advised on the basis of AI-generated risk analysis. Technically there are still many development possibilities. However, whether AI can be applied effectively and responsibly also raises organizational issues, such as:
Professionalism of the inspectors. Risk analyses were conducted before the AI era. These often took place in the minds of professional inspectors and/or during work meetings. In other words: not only data, but also inspectors are an important source of knowledge about risks. Their knowledge is often implicit and based on years of experience. Application of AI can count on resistance from professionals. Not only that: too aggressive application of AI can come at the expense of their valuable knowledge.
Data pollution. Too much risk-based supervision can lead to data pollution: data mainly comes in from those under supervision who have previously been identified as being high-risk. Other people under supervision can thus remain out of sight. They can change their behaviour. There will therefore always be a demand for risk-based random supervision, in which random samples are also used for supervision. Within an organization there are different ideas about the right ratio.
Ethical issues. There is a lot of discussion about bias, protection of vulnerable individuals, transparency and privacy. Of course, these discussions also exist internally. This means that those involved – data scientists, inspectors, managers – make trade-offs between values. Many decisions about data and algorithms can be leading for the outcomes. These decisions increasingly seem to be made 'at the front', the data experts. This presents challenges with regard to the management of the data experts.

Based on these signals, we conclude that further development of AI has both technical and organizational dimensions. Successful development and implementation of AI will therefore have to be linked to the organization of supervisory practices.

How are technical development of AI and the supervisory organization connected and how can this connection be improved? Much literature on AI focuses on technical possibilities, while other literature deals with ethical concerns. Far less literature discusses the actual implementation and use of AI in organizational practice. A study into this subject should have two characteristics:
The research is interdisciplinary. It has both innovative-technical aspects and social-scientific aspects. The question is about the interplay between the two.
Connected to practice. We are looking for the application of AI in the context of practice. That is why we want to conduct empirical research, using one or more cases. The research will be carried out in close collaboration with the Dutch Food and Product Safety Authority (NVWA).
Requirements
In this project you will study and develop arrangements that bring together the world of AI and managements of surveillance.

This requires understanding of AI (data science, machine learning, programming) and more intangible processes of organization, including organization structures, informal coordination and organizational politics. It includes both analysis and design efforts. It will involve conducting case studies at NVWA

We are looking for someone who:
has a Master's degree and a background in policy analysis, public administration or a related field
has affinity (and preferably also demonstratable experience) with AI
has affinity (and preferably also experience) with organizational science
has the ability and interest to cross disciplinary boundaries
is fluent in English, both written and orally
has pro-active communication skills and is able to work well in a team

Doing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and a final thesis. For more details please check the Graduate Schools Admission Requirements.

Since the project is developed in close cooperation with a Dutch inspection agency (NVWA) that mostly communicates in Dutch, a candidate that speaks Dutch or is willing to learn the Dutch language is preferred.
Conditions of employment
Doctoral candidates will be offered a 4-year period of employment in principle, but in the form of 2 employment contracts. An initial 1,5 year contract with an official go/no go progress assessment within 15 months. Followed by an additional contract for the remaining 2,5 years assuming everything goes well and performance requirements are met.

Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities, increasing from € 2541 per month in the first year to € 3247 in the fourth year. As a PhD candidate you will be enrolled in the TU Delft Graduate School. The TU Delft Graduate School provides an inspiring research environment with an excellent team of supervisors, academic staff and a mentor. The Doctoral Education Programme is aimed at developing your transferable, discipline-related and research skills.

The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance and sport memberships, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.

PhD Improving ethical analysis through better theories of the moral role of technological products and systems,"Key takeaways
Hours
38 - 40 hr.
Salary indication
Salary gross/monthly
based on full-time
€ 2,541 - € 3,247
Deadline
3 May 2023

The central question of this project is how we can conceptualize the moral role of technological products and systems, and what implications this conceptualization may have for ethical analysis. The aim is to develop new theories and approaches for analyzing the moral role of technology.

One of the key challenges of ethical analysis in the context of technology is the question of whether technological products are only instruments that modify human moral action, or whether they can be characterized as moral agents or co-agents in their own right. For instance, what is the moral role of guns in causing harm? While humans ultimately pull the trigger, guns have affordances that make killing much easier, with less risk for the shooter. Similarly, what is the role of self-driving cars in causing harm or violating rights? Here, a human operator is not even directly involved. Should we therefore assign moral responsibility to self-driving cars? And how should ethical analysis proceed? Current approaches in ethics of technology often do not have good answers to these questions.

In addition to analyzing individual technological products with individual users, this project will also focus on larger systems with multiple technological components and human operators. Such systems include both sociotechnical systems – predominantly technical systems with human operators and enablers, such as electricity networks, industrial production systems, and the Internet – and technosocial systems – predominantly social systems that rely on technology, such as modern organizations and associations. The project will investigate how we can describe the moral role of these systems, how they produce moral outcomes, and how we can attribute causal and moral responsibility to humans and machines in them.

To achieve these goals, the project will study existing approaches in ethics, especially ethics of technology, to make explicit what roles are assigned to technology and to assess the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches. Existing conceptualizations of technological products can also be explored, in the fields of philosophy of technology, science and technology studies (STS), technology assessment, and/or impact assessment.

The project will be mostly theoretical, but it will also involve a number of case studies of particular technologies that are to be selected by the PhD student, in consultation with supervisors, for example of autonomous vehicles, Internet-of-Things, human enhancement technologies, or any others that are deemed useful for the study.

This project is funded by the ESDiT research program and will be located within the Department of Philosophy at the University of Twente. For description of both, see below. It will be supervised by Prof. dr. Philip Brey and dr. Adam Henschke at the Department of Philosophy of the University of Twente.

PhD on Persuasive Technology and Interaction Design,"Job description
The Department of Industrial Engineering & Innovation Sciences of Eindhoven University of Technology has a PhD position vacancy on interaction design for hearing aid personalization in the Human Technology Interaction (HTI) group. The project is funded by the ROBUST program, and part of the FEPLab.
The current project will focus on the human technology interaction component of hearing aid personalization. Firstly, the tuning process should be as unobtrusive as possible to the HA wearer, since the tuning process should not interfere with daily tasks, such as ongoing conversations. Secondly, the tuning process should be covert in the sense that it should not be noticeable by conversation partners and other bystanders. Finally, there are privacy, security and ethical issues relating to in-situ recording of acoustic data. We wish to avoid storing recorded data for offline training.
The main research challenges are to identify ethical, practical, and social issues of in-situ hearing device tuning and translating these issues to an appropriate interaction protocol. To formulate the interaction protocol, we need to understand why users choose personalized algorithms, and under which circumstances personalization might not be desirable. Based on earlier research on persuasive technology, acceptance of technology, satisfaction and usability, the current research will identify ethical, practical and social issues of in-situ hearing device tuning and translate these issues to an appropriate interaction protocol. Different from earlier research on these topics, for understanding acceptance of a hearing device, it is crucial to investigate determinants of more covert acceptance. That is, preferably, users remain unaware of many characteristics of this technology. For example, users preferably remain only peripherally aware of many interface elements, and even when interaction with the hearing aid is necessary (e.g., for requesting personalization), that interaction remains as covert as possible (to the user and her/his surroundings). Thereby, this research opens new domains of research into technology acceptance, satisfaction with, and usability of more covert technologies.
You will conduct your research under the supervision of dr. Jaap Ham (TU/e) and
Prof. dr. Bert de Vries (TU/e, EE). You will be a member of the Human-Technology Interaction group and the FEPLab group at TU/e.

Job requirements
Talented, enthusiastic candidates with excellent analytical and communication skills holding a master’s degree or an equivalent university degree in human-technology interaction, interaction design, human-computer interaction, or a related discipline are encouraged to apply. The following experience and skillsets are preferred:
Experience with and affinity for working in technology acceptance, interaction design, and persuasive technology fields
Expertise with empirical research among humans and related statists knowledge and skills
A strong interest in human-technology interaction research
A research-oriented attitude
Strong conceptual thinking and planning skills; you are creative and proactive
Ability to work in an interdisciplinary team and interested in collaborating with industrial partners.
Motivated to develop your teaching skills and coach students
Fluent in spoken and written English (C1 level).
Conditions of employment
A meaningful job in a dynamic and ambitious university, in an interdisciplinary setting and with the possibility to present your work at international conferences. You will work on a beautiful, green campus within walking distance of the central train station. In addition, we offer you:
Full-time employment for four years, with an intermediate evaluation (go/no-go) after nine months. You will spend 10% of your employment on teaching tasks.
Salary and benefits (such as a pension scheme, paid pregnancy and maternity leave, partially paid parental leave) in accordance with the Collective Labor Agreement for Dutch Universities.
Additionally, an annual holiday allowance of 8% of the yearly salary, plus a year-end allowance of 8.3% of the annual salary.
An allowance for commuting, working from home and internet costs.
A broad package of fringe benefits, including an excellent technical infrastructure, moving expenses, and savings schemes.
High-quality training programs and other support to grow into a self-aware, autonomous scientific researcher. At TU/e we challenge you to take charge of your own learning process.
An excellent technical infrastructure, on-campus children's day care and sports facilities.
Our Staff Immigration Team can support international candidates.
To support you during your PhD and to prepare you for the rest of your career, you will have free access to a personal development program for PhD students (PROOF program).
Family-friendly initiatives are in place, such as an international spouse program, and excellent on-campus children day care and sports facilities.

Are you an aspiring scientist in the field of cognitive neuroscience, looking to start your academic career off right? Then join the world-renowned Donders Institute as a PhD candidate and work with top-notch experimental equipment to build computational models of body representation, both somatosensory and multisensory.

We are looking for a motivated PhD candidate with interest and expertise in building computational models of body representation, both somatosensory and multisensory.

You will be part of the ERC funded project 'The Body Positioning System: A GPS for somatosensory space'. The goal of the project is to uncover how the brain localises touch on a body whose three-dimensional posture changes from moment to moment (The Body Positioning System). How does the brain transform sensory input on the skin to a full-fledged three-dimensional body representation? To make headway on this fundamental question, we will use a variety of neuroscientific approaches, such as behavioural and M/EEG experiments that employ novel virtual reality and robot-based paradigms. We will also leverage several analytical tools, such as computational modelling and machine learning.

As a PhD candidate, you will design novel, real-world behavioural paradigms to measure tactile localisation in three-dimensional space. Importantly, you will then use computational modelling to characterise and identify the mechanisms underlying the localization behaviour. The goal of these models is to understand the transformations used by the Body Positioning System. Your work is likely to involve close collaboration with fellow members of the team, including colleagues from other departments at the Donders Institute. Project management, mentoring BSc and MSc students, and teaching-related tasks will also be part of your responsibilities.

Profile
You hold a MSc degree in Cognitive Neuroscience or a relevant discipline, such as Artificial Intelligence, Psychology, Cognitive Science or Engineering.
You have experience with collecting behavioural data, or a strong desire to learn.
You have experience with computational modelling and machine learning, or a strong desire to learn.
You have at least some experience with common programming languages, such as Matlab, Python, R, or C++.
You are a team player who possesses good social, communication and organisational skills.
You have a passion for science and the pursuit of knowledge.

About the department

Over the past decade, the scientific field of Communication Science has changed

profoundly due to the continuous emergence of new media technologies and the rise of a media-saturated digital society, new empirical research methods, and new dynamic communication routes. The department of Communication Science at the VU

Amsterdam (see our staff here ) responds to these major trends with an educational

program (BA/MA) that teaches Communication Science within a “digital society”

framework, and that trains related skills (e.g., on data and computational methods) and knowledge (e.g., on digital marketing) using timely and innovative teaching methods. The department also responds to these major trends by maintaining a pointed and forward-looking research program that is strategically focusing on an examination of Communication Choices, Content and Consequences (CCCC). The department is in a strong position in the field because it has clearly focused on newly emerging communication technologies and solid empirical methods ever since its start in 2003. The department maintains particular expertise in adapting psychology and computer sciences to the study of media. Researchers within the CCCC program are currently organized into three evolving research areas crucial to the discipline of Communication Science: Political Communication (focusing on computational methods, mostly in a political communication domain), Media Psychology (including work on experience and effects of Social Robotics and Virtual Reality), and Digital Media (focusing on social media, mostly in a marketing, PR, and organizational communication context). Teachers are also organised in the theme group Teaching Excellence. The department has been ranked in 2020 at a strong #10 of all departments/universities worldwide in the prestigious Shanghai ranking, the CCCC research program received very strong review scores in the last assessment, and the teaching program was positively evaluated and accredited in the last assessment (2018/2019).
