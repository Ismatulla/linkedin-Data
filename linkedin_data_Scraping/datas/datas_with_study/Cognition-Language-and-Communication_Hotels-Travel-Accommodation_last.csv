This beautiful building dates back to the 17th century and is located on the banks of the Amstel River, in the historic heart of Amsterdam. It won't surprise you that over three centuries, it has hosted royal and legendary guests, from Queen Victoria to the Beatles. Rembrandt's 'Night Watch' was painted to display within its walls. Our hotel is monumental and offers a classic contemporary look. The tram and metro stop Rokin is around the corner, as is Rembrandtplein. We work in a small team and know each other well. We have a lot of personal contact with our guests and because of our small size we help each other in all departments to achieve that 'extraordinary' guest experience.
