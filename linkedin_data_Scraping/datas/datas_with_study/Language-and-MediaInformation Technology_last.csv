Communications Officer / Writer,"We’re looking for a gifted writer and expert communicator. Our ideal candidate will be someone who can get to the bottom of complex issues quickly and work across the company to develop clear messaging and innovative communications approaches that fit into a wider strategy. Much of this work is detail-orientated, highly political, and very technical in nature. This makes for an incredibly meaningful and rewarding role, as you will be driving projects that really make a difference and support the technical core of the Internet, with a team of fun-loving and highly performing communications professionals to back you up.
Communications Officer / Writer
Location: from our office at Amsterdam Central station and from home
37.5 hours per week
As you’ll see from our website, we do a lot of very different, very complicated things. As our newest Communications Officer, you will support understanding of our role and communicate our position on a range of issues to the wider technical community. You will also help your marketing colleagues to increase awareness of the many tools and services we offer.
This work can often be highly paced, especially when responding to queries from media or the technical community when there is an issue with one of our core technical services. This will see you advising your colleagues at all levels across the company to determine our response (prior experience with crisis communications would be a big help here).
Crucially, you will develop strong relationships across the company, as you’ll be supporting other departments in their work and will need their buy-in to do this effectively. You will also possess a high degree of empathy and common sense, allowing you to think ahead and anticipate potential responses to our actions and messages; our stakeholders do not hesitate to speak up if we do not meet their expectations in terms of accuracy and transparency, so it’s important to get it right the first time.
In this role you will:
Write and edit/review a wide range of different texts (presentations, announcements, messaging, articles, technical documentation, promotional materials etc.)
Minute technical discussions, review/edit corporate governance and policy documents, and help to document and report on our activities (with a close eye for detail)
Provide communications support across the organisation on projects and ad hoc issues
Develop communication campaigns, strategies, approaches and drive them through to completion
Research and analyse trends, demographics and related information
Consider a complex set of priorities, viewpoints and requirements from our membership and other stakeholders
Contribute to our public relations strategy
Provide communications support for large-scale industry conferences across Europe, the Middle East and parts of Central Asia.
What we expect from you:
Natural writer who is a strong advocate for plain English and clear communication
Curious and adaptable mindset
Bachelor’s degree or equivalent, with at least five years’ experience in communications or journalism
Experience developing/implementing communications plans
Ability to network and build effective relationships
Native English speaker or equivalent
Willing to travel to various locations throughout Europe, Central Asia and the Middle East – usually a minimum of two trips per year (5-7 days per trip)
It would also be nice if you have:
Experience responding to media requests
Knowledge of the Internet industry
What can we offer you:
A role where you can drive your own impactful projects and where your expertise and knowledge are valued
A modern, flexible and informal work environment with an emphasis on a healthy work/life balance
An annual salary between EUR 50k and EUR 62k/year (before tax) for a fulltime week (37,5 hours per week). This includes the standard 8% annual “holiday pay”
Excellent secondary benefits: 5% end-of-year bonus, non-contributory pension scheme, paid parental leave, top-tier health insurance coverage for you and your family and 33 vacation days (full-time)
A generous yearly training allowance for professional development
The Communications Department
Our international team of nine communications professionals works across the organisation to help us connect with our members and the wider Internet community. The cutting-edge service portfolio of the RIPE NCC and the deep technical knowledge of our audience requires creativity, innovation and an ability to keep pace with the rapidly changing tech landscape.
You will join an evolving group of communications, marketing, events and design experts and will work both as part of a team while also leading your own projects. If you’re an out-of-the-box thinker, have a collaborative mindset, are authentic and empathetic, and like to work on exciting projects, we think you’d fit in well with our dynamic team.
