What do we have to offer?
As a senior economic consultant, our clients see you as their trusted advisor on our scenario-based risk and return expectations and their positioning against the current macroeconomic environment. The quantitative economic scenarios that you will be advising on are a crucial input in the financial decision making for many applications such as ALM, risk management, and financial planning. Example applications include analyzing exposure to which asset classes fits best with investment goals, and whether investment goals are attainable with the current strategic asset allocation.

As a project leader, you are responsible for the management of sales and client servicing projects. Examples are running trials of our scenarios for potential new clients, the onboarding and implementation of new clients, and projects that improve the services that we provide to our global client base, such as rolling out a new stress testing suite.

The Scenarios and Asset Valuation Solution
You will be part of our Scenarios and Asset Valuation (SAV) Solution, which is a group of about 25 persons with an academic background. SAV is an innovative multidisciplinary group with Consultants, Quantitative Financial Analysts, and Quantitative Developers as well as Software Developers.

We provide both real-world and risk-neutral economic scenarios to enable our clients to manage the complexity of investment decision making. Our real-world scenarios provide risk and return projections that dynamically adjust to the latest economic and financial market circumstances. This includes the effects of ‘externalities’ such as central bank interventions or the Covid-19 pandemic and has a global coverage of asset classes for many different regions. We achieve this by integrating characteristics of realistic market behavior (“stylized facts”) into forward-looking asset prices, yield curves, and volatilities as well as into the broader macro-economic environment. Our risk-neutral scenarios enable actuaries and finance professionals to perform market-consistent valuations of optionality in insurance liabilities and of financial contingent claims more generally.
