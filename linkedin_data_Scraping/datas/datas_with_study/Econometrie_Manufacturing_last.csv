In onze eerste fabriek in Rotterdam maken we met ruim 300 collega’s dagelijks zo’n 3 miljoen Nespresso® compatibele capsules. Op onze tweede locatie maken we sinds 2016 Dolce Gusto® compatibele capsules. Sinds 2019 hebben we Nespresso Professional aan ons product portfolio toegevoegd. In 2020 zijn we gestart met de bouw van een derde fabriek die eind 2021 is geopend. Euro Caps heeft tientallen jaren aan expertise in huis over koffie en het verpakken ervan in capsules.
