Domain Expert Geomechanics,"The Role
PetroSigns is Shell's new platform that combines subsurface and surface modelling capabilities to help teams optimize field development and hydrocarbon recovery. PetroSigns provides competitive advantage through end-to-end Static and Dynamic Reservoir Modelling capabilities. The platform has three key components: Earth for static modelling, Flow for dynamic and surface network modelling and Fusion for integrated reservoir modelling. Thus, PetroSigns contains the applications supporting the range of subsurface development disciplines, including Geosciences, Petrophysics, Reservoir Engineering, Geomechanics and Production Technology.
Geomechanics is a key component of the dynamic modelling capabilities within PetroSigns and currently one of the software development teams builds integrated workflows for coupled geomechanics-flow modelling, uncertainty management and optimization that span across both Earth and Flow components.
What’s the role?
The primary focus for this challenging position is to enhance existing geomechanics workflows with key functionality: Combining probability and deterministic approaches for fault stability and seal integrity, 4D seismic signals and corresponding geomechanics effects, 1D-4D seamless processing from wellbore stability to history matching with subsidence data and fully integrated uncertainty with geomechanics input regarding stress / fault / rock material properties.
Developing and deploying these differentiating capabilities in PetroSigns requires deep technical skills in the geomechanics engineering domain as well as previous experience and strong affinity with modern IT.
The successful candidate will be accountable for:
Supporting the definition of geomechanics end-to-end workflows, for developing new functionality in PetroSigns and connecting to existing tools for numerical modelling and wellbore stability and probability of failure estimates for fault stability analysis and for 4D seismic signals due to geomechanics
Contributing to the development efforts in one of the PetroSigns development teams, and help extend, improve, and maintain the geomechanical software stack within Shell’s integrated PetroSigns modelling platform.
Monitoring and promoting Interdisciplinary collaboration activities, project and business-units wide
Helping in setting relative priorities in developing and maintaining the portfolio of applications, from ELAM (external and legacy applications) to QRM (quantitative reservoir management) application and PetroSigns
Developing a working knowledge of Integrated Reservoir Modelling relevant aspects, with focus on Petrophysics and Geomechanics aspects in Decision Based Multi Scenario Modelling
Liaising and collaborating with support, deployment/delivery teams and business units for ensuring users feedback is properly processed and considered
Working with subsurface Workflow Advisers and Reservoir Modelling Advisors
Contribute to further maturing HPC (High Performance Computing) capabilities in PetroSigns.
Adopting and supporting the SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) processes and development practices in the PetroSigns project
Other Dimensions:
Work location is hybrid: Shell’s The Hague Campus combined with working from home
It is our intention to develop the candidate into an expert regarding the integrated geomechanical software workflows, through involvement in case studies and support/deployment activities
What we need from you
MSc or higher in Petroleum Engineering, Natural Sciences, Mathematics or Computer Science
Expertise or willingness to attain in subsurface modelling (static to dynamic), geomechanics workflows and applications including aspects of 1D to 4D modelling with understanding of key applications: wellbore stability analysis and key parameters as fracture gradients and pore pressures, numerical modelling for 3D-4D effects of compaction and subsidence including seismic signals, stress field changes, rock mechanics properties, fault stability analysis, history matching of satellite / bathymetry data and 3D models
Relevant experience with scientific/technical C#/C++/C software development (can be part of the candidate’s higher education)
Good understanding of subsurface workflows from static / structural modelling to dynamic / reservoir engineering components and their relevance to delivering geomechanics models
Working knowledge of Linux as well as Windows
Expertise in or willingness to learn Petrophysics and Geomechanics specific software tools used and being developed
Expertise in or willingness to learn relevant Integrated Reservoir Modelling processes
Good communication skills
Team player and can work in a multidisciplinary team in a global context.
