Are you an aspiring researcher, looking to start your academic career off well-prepared? As a junior lecturer / PhD candidate, you will not only conduct research into economics, but also teach your knowledge, skills and methods to students. This way, you will be able to obtain both your PhD and university teaching qualification in one position.

We are looking for multiple full-time PhD Candidates/Junior Lecturers in Economics and Business Economics. Over a period of six years, you will spend half of your time on research and the other half on teaching.

As a junior lecturer, you will convey contemporary knowledge, skills and methods to our Bachelor's students using traditional and state-of-the-art teaching tools. As a researcher, you will address one of the various contemporary challenges for academia and society. Besides using the traditional economist's toolbox, you will integrate theories and methods from other disciplines so that your research will allow for multidisciplinary perspectives.

We are convinced that economists from Radboud University can make a difference in dealing with today's societal and organisational challenges. We therefore train out-of-the-box thinking economists to become properly equipped academics who are well prepared for the future economics job market.

As a lecturer, you will give tutorials, assist in teaching courses, and supervise theses in the Bachelor's programme offered by the Department of Economics and Business Economics. As you gain more experience, you will get more responsibilities in teaching. Depending on your skills and expertise, you will also teach methodological courses (mathematics, statistics, and econometrics with R) next to content courses in economics (such as micro- and macroeconomics) and/or accounting and (corporate) finance. After six years, you will ultimately have developed sufficient teaching skills to obtain a university teaching qualification.

As a researcher, you will work on one of the following themes (PhD supervisors in brackets):
1) Organisational Economics (Prof. Robbert Maseland: robbert.maseland@ru.nl/Prof. André van Hoorn: andre.vanhoorn@ru.nl).
2) Accounting in Healthcare (Prof. Frank Hartmann: frank.hartmann@ru.nl).
3) Corporate Governance and Accountability (Prof. Frank Hartmann: frank.hartmann@ru.nl).
4) Health Economics (Prof. Natascha Wagner: natascha.wagner@ru.nl).
5) Digital Transformation in Economics (Dr. Sascha Füllbrunn: sascha.fullbrunn@ru.nl).
6) Climate Change and Economics (Prof. André van Hoorn: andre.vanhoorn@ru.nl/Prof. Robbert Maseland: robbert.maseland@ru.nl).

With your supervisory team, you will carve out your own research trajectory in the first year. This project description must be approved by the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Nijmegen School of Management. For each theme, the envisioned key elements of such a research trajectory are available upon request from the PhD supervisor concerned.

"PhD position 'The Economics, Sustainability and Resilience of Novel and High-tech food-supply chains'","Within the Business Economics group of Wageningen University (www.bec.wur.nl) a PhD position has become available, linking the economics, sustainability and resilience of crop production and food-supply chains with insights on novel food production systems. The broader framework of the position is within the 4TU project Redesign, which aims to develop a high-tech and data-driven agri-food system of the future. The PhD position will be jointly supervised together with the Operations Research and Logistic Group of Wageningen University.

The main focus of the research will be on the empirical analysis of (1) the sustainability and resilience of novel food-supply chains, and (2) the decision-making of food-value chain actors, i.e., how the design of the novel supply chain organization and the interactions of actors within, affect the implementation, sustainability and resilience of these food -supply chains.
The PhD project has a quantitative-analytical nature. Various techniques will be applied, such as qualitative and quantitative analysis of data, the analysis of decision-making and behavior using surveys and workshops, as well as the design of a sustainable supply-chain game. The aim is to supply relevant information for the design of novel, sustainable and resilient food-supply chains. Hence, translation of research findings to other disciplines and working together with food-supply chain stakeholders also is an important aspect of the work.
Activities include:
Providing an overview on the economics, resilience and sustainability of novel food-supply chains;
Empirically assessing and comparing the sustainability and resilience of novel food-supply chains;
Eliciting and analyzing decisions of supply-chain actors;
Design and testing of a sustainable supply-chain game with different food supply-chain actors.
An openness for other disciplines is important and collaborations with researchers and research groups within the 4TU Redesign project will be facilitated. Relevant courses to overcome possible knowledge/skill gaps will be provided.

Are you interested in studying networks and using methodology at the cross-section of business analytics, econometrics and computer science? The Business Analytics section at the University of Amsterdam Business School invites applications for a PhD position in Network Statistics and Machine Learning. We are looking for candidates with the ambition to work and succeed at the highest international academic level.

The main topic of research is network analysis and modelling using statistical and machine learning tools. Network data are ubiquitous in finance, social media, the economy, and business. Social networks play an increasingly important role in society. For example, the Reddit community WallStreetBets hyped the stock of GameStop (GME), causing a short squeeze and extremely volatile stock prices in early 2021. Similarly, statements made on social networks such as Twitter have been shown to impact public and voter opinions. Exemplifying how social networks directly affect the economy, this project focusses on studying network data with a specific interest in modelling and understanding how networks change over time. Change detection in an online fashion is a challenging task in networks of large size, a common property of social networks.

In this research, the candidate will first investigate and develop interpretable network analysis approaches using statistical models and test them on real-life data. Then geometric deep learning approaches for the tasks like node classification, link prediction and graph classification will be developed with change detection ability. In the final phase of the project, the candidate should bring together two families of methods and design an optimized algorithm that is both interpretable and yields a high performance in network change detection.

The PhD student will work in close collaboration with the supervisory team and other faculty on the tasks.
The supervisory team will consist of dr. Inez Zwetsloot (ABS), dr. Simon Trimborn (ASE) and dr. Stevan Rudinac (ABS).

What are you going to do?

Develop novel interpretable statistical models for network analysis;
develop novel deep-learning approaches for node classification, link prediction, and community detection in network data;
create open data and software tools for the envisioned network analysis tasks;
present research findings at international conferences;
write up findings for publication in international journals;
pursue and complete a PhD thesis within the appointed duration of four years;
attend classes and seminars (including those offered at other universities) to develop thinking and research skills further;
participate in and contribute to departmental research functions (PhD Day, research seminars, and research meetings);
assist in knowledge dissemination activities;
participate in teaching-related activities (to a limited degree), including undergraduate tutorials and the supervision of MSc and/or BSc thesis projects.

What do we require?

Formal requirements:
Masters’ degree in Statistics, Econometrics, Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Mathematics, or a related field (expected to finish by September 2023)

Task-related requirements:
Excellent communication skills in English, both oral and written, ideally with experience writing for a scientific audience;
willingness and motivation to independently formulate research projects and carry them through to completion;
mathematical skills, data analytics skills, and a strong willingness to develop these skills further;
excellent programming skills in one or more of the following languages: Python, R, C, C++;
preferably experience with at least one of the following: network data analysis, deep learning libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow, timeseries modeling and prediction, high-performance computing.3

Additional requirements:
Preference is given to candidates with some research experience (e.g., Master thesis and/or research assistant experience);
strong commitment to methodological rigor and scientific integrity;
energy and passion for statistics and machine learning;
intellectual curiosity, eagerness to learn, and openness to criticism;
willingness to participate in disseminating research results and valorization.

Our offer

The employment contract will be for four years with an initial period of 18 months, with an intermediate evaluation after 18 months and a possibility to extend it for 30 months (in total, four years). End-result should be a PhD thesis. An educational plan will be drafted that includes attendance of courses and (international) conferences. Preferred starting date is 1 September 2023.

The gross monthly salary will range from €2,541 in the first year to €3,247 in the last year. The Collective Labor Agreement for Dutch Universities is applicable.
