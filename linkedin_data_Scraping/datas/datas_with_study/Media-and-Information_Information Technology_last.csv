You will use data to balance customer and business needs against technical constraints; if the data you want doesn’t exist, you find a way to make it happen.
We work backwards from the customer, always.
You will reduce ambiguity through detailed functional and non-functional requirements, system design, and implementing mechanisms to improve technical delivery efficiency.
As a TPM, you delight in building self-perpetuating mechanisms to solve recurring problems, instead of a manual process.
In addition to the above, knowledge of the following is required: scrum methodologies, agile project management, release (program increment) scheduling.

Strategic, outcome-focused planning to influence customer roadmaps.
Provide program transparency through predictable, proactive reporting tailored to the appropriate audience (Senior LT, Engineering Teams, and stakeholders) so that service and business owners have clear visibility on initiatives.
Proactively identify ways to improve processes and capabilities to ensure we are compliant, efficient, and up to date and ensure all ServiceNow and industry standards are adhered throughout project execution.
Apply SDLC best practices for projects based on experiences with a number of agile and blended approaches, as well effectively coordinating the implementations across multiple teams with different approaches.
