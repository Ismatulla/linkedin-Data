Are you a highly motivated aspiring junior researcher? Do you have a background in the history of philosophy, logic and science in the later middle ages? Do you want to develop your own innovative research ideas as a key member of a research team? The Center for the History of Philosophy and Science (CHPS) of the Faculty of Philosophy, Theology and Religious Studies is looking to appoint a PhD candidate for the duration of four years, to conduct research on 'Marsilius of Inghen on imagination and impossibility in logic and metaphysics'.

You will join Dr Ciola's research team and work closely with her, another PhD candidate and a postdoctoral researcher, contributing to the ERC Starting Grant project 'The Impossible and the Imaginable: Late-Medieval Semantics of Impossibility and the Roots of Complex Mathematics'. You can find a description of the project here.

You will produce original research on Marsilius of Inghen's views on possibility, impossibility and imaginability, in the form of a doctoral dissertation and several scientific articles. You will work on technical theories in late medieval semantics, such as supposition and ampliation, and assess how Marsilius's views on empty terms play out across his logical, metaphysical and scientific works. You will also explore 'big ideas' (the possible, the impossible, the imaginable) and broader intellectual movements, contextualising Marsilius's own commitment to impossibilia and assessing it against the views of 14th-century philosophers in the same intellectual tradition, such as John Buridan, Albert of Saxony, Nicole Oresme and Peter of Ailly. You will bring your own interests, skills and particular expertise to enrich your project and the work of the team as a whole. You will collaborate with the other members of the team in various research, dissemination and outreach activities, and you will actively participate to the CHPS's analogous initiatives. The Center has a very cohesive research group. Its members gather daily in a friendly, informal and intellectually lively environment. They share their research in work-in-progress meetings, and they co-teach, co-publish, and co-organise conferences. PhD supervision is of high quality, not at the least because of the daily presence of supervisors and supervisees at the department.

This research position carries no teaching obligations.

We are
The Center for the History of Philosophy and Science (CHPS) brings together historians of philosophy and historians of science in a single teaching and research unit. CHPS's core research interests focus on the interplay between philosophical and scientific thought from Antiquity to the 21st century, also addressing the important questions that these themes raise for contemporary philosophers.

Research and teaching topics include the notions of place and space, time, matter, motion, chance and necessity, but also soul, mind and cognition. Within the global academic landscape, CHPS is unique in approaching the history of philosophy and the history of science as historically intertwined phenomena. For this reason, it has attracted staff, PhD candidates, and postdoctoral researchers from many countries, and functions as an international hub for scholars interested in the combination of the history of philosophy and the history of science. In addition to addressing academic peers, CHPS also reaches out to a wider audience to contribute to a better understanding of the historical trajectory that has led to today's science and technology-driven society.

The Athena Institute is exploring this in various case studies: ‘traditional healing in the Dutch Caribbean’, ‘Indisch Zwijgen among diverse Indonesian communities in NL, ‘healing among victims of the toeslagenaffaire in NL. Using reflexive monitoring and action we aim to contribute to the transformation of a more inclusive Europe. How can we measure social impact of healing interventions better?

Assistant Professor (career track) in Transdisciplinary Science & Technology Studies,"The position

At the Athena Institute of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam we invite applications for a full-time permanent appointment as assistant professor in Transdisciplinary Science & Technology Studies, specializing in material approaches for transformation.


LOCATION: Amsterdam

FTE: 1

Job description
Within STS there is increasing attention for transdisciplinary scholarship that explores new forms of knowledge production, expression, and travel in relation to technoscience. This development happens under several related headings, such as STS Making & Doing, Situated Intervention, Material Participation and Experimental Collaborations. These approaches share that scholars adopt active roles in the co-shaping of knowledge practices and technologies. Scholarship in this domain requires entwining normative commitments with experimental, co-constructive theory-method packages that extend beyond discursive interventions.


Your duties

In this position you need to empirically study and experimentally shape practices of technology development and/or knowledge production. Your research approach should primarily be experimental and collaborative, with the aim of addressing societal challenges regarding participation in science and technology, broadly defined. Your profile should display specific attention to questions of equity. Research at the Athena Institute includes approaches such as STS Making & Doing; Interactive Learning and Action; Reflexive monitoring in action (RMA); and Situated Intervention, that share that issue-articulation and the exploration of solutions are developed in collaboration with a wide range of actors/stakeholders. Although there are no specific requirements regarding topical areas of specialization, candidates need to relate their work to the five research themes of the Athena Institute; Emerging science and technology; (Global) health and well-being; Nature, agriculture and environment; Competency development in inter- and transdisciplinary research; and History of knowledge. The successful candidate is expected to collaborate with different colleagues in projects across these research themes.
Requirements
A completed PhD in science, technology & society studies, participatory design, innovation studies, or a related (inter)discipline; an additional background in the sciences is a plus;
Proven experience with experimental methods for the transdisciplinary study of public issues/challenges;
Experience with participatory research methods that co-shape technologies and knowledge practices to address societal challenges in an equitable way;
Proven ability to be a strong collaborator within interdisciplinary teams (listening, flexible, adaptive, pro-active);
Strong and relevant publication track-record, commensurate with the candidate’s career stage and complementing and extending the Athena Institute’s research portfolio;
Experience with applying for research grants and externally funded projects and ability to meet deadlines and produce deliverables;
Excellent teaching skills and the ability to inspire students (demonstrated through a.o. positive student evaluations);
A teaching qualification (in Dutch BKO);
An (inter)national network relevant to the position;
Good command of Dutch (preferred) and excellent command of English.
Faculty criteria for appointment at the level of assistant professor are available upon request but minimally include having completed a PhD and having approximately 10 international peer reviewed publications.


Given the extensive collaboration with both international as well as Dutch partners, a good command of Dutch language is required for the position. Since this appointment is intended to result in a tenured position, strong candidates who can convincingly argue that they will be able to master a good working level of Dutch in a relatively short period of time (e.g. through having lived/worked/studied in the Netherlands or having mastered a similar foreign language before) are welcome to apply.
What are we offering?
A challenging career track position from Assistant Professor 2 to Assistant Professor 1 in a socially involved organization. On full-time basis the remuneration amounts to a minimum gross monthly salary of €3,974 (scale 11) and a maximum €5,439 (scale 11), depending on your education and experience. The job profile: Assistant Professor 2 is based on the university job ranking system and is vacant for at least 0.8 FTE.


We offer 2 types of contracts. For candidates already living in the Netherlands, we offer a permanent position after 18 months, after a successful evaluation in your 15th month. After a successful evaluation, a path will be outlined for future academic development.

To candidates that will relocate from abroad we offer a second option next to the previous one. This will be a first (temporary) contract for the duration of 6 years. After 2 and 4 years the performance will be evaluated in terms of teaching, publication record, and acquisition of project funding (in addition to the annual assessment with your supervisor). After a successful evaluation permanent employment will be granted after 6 years and a path will be outlined for future academic development.


Additionally, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam offers excellent fringe benefits and various schemes and regulations to promote a good work/life balance, such as:
a maximum of 41 days of annual leave based on full-time employment,
8% holiday allowance and
8.3% end-of-year bonus,
solid pension scheme (ABP),
possibility to save holiday hours, for sabbatical leave,
child daycare facilities available on campus

We are also open for other suggestions and directions within the larger theme of the project.
Key responsibilities:
Completion of a PhD thesis within four years;
Participation in meetings of the project research group;
Presentations of intermediate research results at workshops and conferences;

Professor of Architectural and Urban History,"Professor of Architectural and Urban History
Faculteit/Dienst: Faculteit der Geesteswetenschappen
Opleidingsniveau: Gepromoveerd
Functie type: Wetenschappelijk Personeel
Sluitingsdatum: 26 April 2023
Vacaturenummer: 11325
The Faculty of Humanities employs just under 1,000 employees, and approximately 8,000 students study there. The faculty consists of eight departments: Philosophy, Dutch Studies, Media Studies, Art and Cultural Studies, History, European Studies and Religious Studies, Amsterdam Centre for Ancient Studies and Archaeology, Modern Foreign Languages and Cultures, and Literature and Linguistics. Each department is composed of capacity groups, which consist of one or more professors and a number of employees who work in the relevant field.

The Department of Art and Cultural Studies has a vacancy for a full professorship in:

Architectural and Urban History 1,0 FTE (permanent position)

What will you do?

Context of the chair
The Professor of Architectural and Urban History is affiliated with the Amsterdam School of Historical Studies (ASH) and the Arts and Culture department (more specifically the Art History chair group). The basis for the chair is the historical approach of architecture from an art history perspective: this is of fundamental importance in order to ensure the necessary broad Humanities outlook for interdisciplinary research and teaching within and outside the UvA. In addition, the perspective will be broadened to include urban history, with special attention in the research dedicated to the experience of the urban environment; a more international interpretation that does not yet exist in the Netherlands. The new colleague to be appointed will therefore have architectural history experience with an added focus on contemporary urban history and urban design history, as well as the interplay between the built and natural environment, in which environmental history experience (the role of the historical city in its natural environment) is extremely desirable. The focus in this regard will be on a historical perspective that can be linked to modern-day problems of the urban and architectural living environment. This means that expertise in various approaches to the built environment, for example based on experience of the living environment (perception of the environment) will be expected.
The professor will be responsible, in particular, for teaching in the Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Art History, as well as in the Bachelor in Global Arts, Culture and Politics. The professor will play a significant role in both the teaching for the Master’s track Stadsgeschiedenis (Urban History) within the department of History, European Studies and Religious Studies and for various other degree programmes. In addition, the new professor is expected to undertake administrative tasks.

The chair will provide a strong starting point for the aforementioned collaborations within the University, but also with researchers and external institutions, such as Arcam, Het Nieuwe Instituut, the Cultural Heritage Agency, urban authorities and NGOs. The professor is expected to play a leading role in these types of collaborations.

Teaching
The professor will first be responsible for the Architectural History components within the Art History capacity group (capaciteitsgroep Kunstgeschiedenis). Architectural History is one of the four chair groups within the Art History capacity group, in addition to Medieval Art History (Middeleeuwse kunstgeschiedenis), Art History of the Early Modern Period (Kunstgeschiedenis van de nieuwere tijd), and Modern and Contemporary Art History (Moderne en hedendaagse kunstgeschiedenis). Approximately a quarter of the compulsory curriculum of the BA is therefore provided by the Architectural History chair group. In addition to these components, Architectural History also provides three successful BA specialisations, which can also be taken as electives (see also Minor): Ontwerpen voor de moderne stad (Designing for the Modern City); Dit is Amsterdam: identiteit en beeldvorming in kunst en architectuur (This is Amsterdam: identity and perception in art and architecture) and Reparatie en imitatie. Over het gebouwde erfgoed in het ‘eigentijdse’ Amsterdam. Over het gebouwde erfgoed in het 'eigentijdse' Amsterdam. (Repair and imitation. About the built heritage in ‘contemporary Amsterdam).

Secondly, the professor will make an important contribution to the minor Architectuur en Stedenbouw (minor in Architecture and Urban Planning). This is taken annually by approx. 20 students (mostly Human Geography, Urban and Regional Planning, and Geography students, in addition to students from other studies, including English, Economics, Communication Science, Philosophy, Sociology and Anthropology). The minor also provides a basis for the interdisciplinary Master’s track Stadsgeschiedenis (Urban History, department of History, European Studies and Religious Studies: approx. 5 minor students move on to this track annually. Finally, the professor will play an important role in the BA programme Global Arts, Culture and Politics, particularly the major in Sustainability).

Research
The professor will conduct research within the research school Amsterdam School of Historical Studies (ASH). It is important for the research school that the professor’s research ties in with the new methodological and theoretical developments within architectural history that also considers, in addition to the built environment, the urban perception of the environment from a social perspective and sensory experience. An additional expertise in the interplay between the built and natural environment is desirable. The new professor will take a central position within the Centre for Urban History within ASH. This centre has developed into an important pillar within ASH for interdisciplinary research into the history of the city from antiquity to the present day, with approximately 35 staff members from various disciplines. The professor is expected to assume a connecting and guiding role within this centre. In addition, the professor will be responsible for setting up broad interdisciplinary collaborations with researchers within the Faculty of Humanities (FGw) and the University of Amsterdam (UvA), for example with Urban Studies within the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences (FMG), leading to individual or group applications for research financing (ERC, NWO, NWA, etc.). In addition, an international orientation (with corresponding network) is desirable in order to guarantee the leading role of the chair in Amsterdam within a field that is increasingly globally oriented.
The newly appointed professor is further expected to have knowledge of contemporary, innovative and digital research methods, which provide insight into issues about the digital built environment, the digital city (also an important theme within the MA track Urban History) and the living environment, and to collaborate with researchers in Creative Amsterdam: An E-Humanities perspective, and the 4D-Research Lab.

It is expected that the professor to be appointed will be able to enthuse and mentor young researchers; that the professor will have experience in PhD supervision and be able to contribute to creating a safe and stimulating environment for PhD candidates. The professor will also bear responsibility for actively recruiting PhD candidates by means of submitting grant applications in the Netherlands and abroad.

Leadership
The professor to be appointed will preside over the Architectural History chair group with five staff members, which will include two lecturers, a professor by special appointment and two assistant professors, and will have to perform administrative duties at the level of the educational administration (programme director BA of MA), research organisation (e.g. research director of ASH or the national research school for art history) and/or at departmental level (capacity group chair Art History, departmental chair Arts and Culture). Expansion of the administrative capacity is needed within these various levels. Given the desire to create an environment for employees and students that is safe and inclusive, it is of vital importance that the professor to be appointed possesses organisational sensitivity and exercises leadership that is appropriate in this regard.

Your tasks and responsibilities:
teaching Architectural and Urban History, including supervising Bachelor’s and Master’s theses;
contributing to innovation and improvement of the curriculum in the field of Architectural and Urban History;

actively pursuing external funding for research, notably funding from research councils, on national as well as European level;
carrying out HR responsibilities within the Architectural History chair group;
carrying out administrative and management tasks within the Department and Faculty.

You:
hold a PhD in Architectural History or a related academic field;
have an excellent international academic reputation and publication profile, which match the research themes of ASH;
have an affinity with inclusive, polyphonous historical scholarship and digital methods;

Are you a highly motivated aspiring junior researcher? Do you have a background in the history of philosophy, logic, science or intellectual history between the later Middle Ages and the Renaissance? Do you want to develop your own innovative research ideas as a key member of a research team? The Center for the History of Philosophy and Science (CHPS) of the Faculty of Philosophy, Theology and Religious Studies is looking to appoint a PhD candidate for the duration of four years, to conduct research on 'The Via Marsiliana Across the Impossible'.


You will join Dr Ciola's research team and work closely with her, another PhD candidate and a postdoctoral researcher, contributing to the ERC Starting Grant project The Impossible and the Imaginable: Late-Medieval Semantics of Impossibility and the Roots of Complex Mathematics. You can find a description of the project here.


You will produce original research on the reception of Marsilius of Inghen's semantics between the late-14th and the 16th centuries, resulting in a doctoral dissertation and several scientific articles. You will provide a first assessment of the 'Marsilian way' of conceiving nominalism and the role played by Marsilius's account of imaginable impossibilities as a characteristic feature of 'Marsilian' philosophy. You will do so by exploring three case studies over the course of your appointment. First, you will study the reception, rooting and impact of Marsilius's semantics among the nominalist masters active at the University of Pavia between the late 14th and 16th centuries. Second, you will explore Marsilius's influence on the 15th century debate about the instant of change, focusing on Giovanni Mariliani's and Apollinare Offredi's criticisms against Peter of Mantua. Third, you will provide a first assessment of the 'Marsilian' positions discussed in the 15th- and 16th-century disputes on empty terms, through a focused analysis of authors such as Juan de Celaya, Fernando de Enzinas, Hyeronimus Pardo, Juan Martínez Siliceo, Domingo de Soto, Anthonius Silvester and William Manderston.


You will collaborate with the other members of the team in various research, dissemination and outreach activities, and you will actively participate in the CHPS's analogous initiatives. The Center has a very cohesive research group. Its members gather daily in a friendly, informal and intellectually lively environment. They share their research in work-in-progress meetings, and they co-teach, co-publish, and co-organise conferences. PhD supervision is of high quality, not at the least because of the daily presence of supervisors and supervisees at the department.


This research position carries no teaching obligations.

The Faculty of Humanities at Leiden University invites applications for a fulltime PhD position in Buddhist Studies. The PhD candidate will carry out research in the framework of the European Research Council (ERC) funded project ""Locating Literature, Lived Religion, and Lives in the Himalayas: The Van Manen Collection"" led by dr. Berthe Jansen. This project offers a study of an important collection of Himalayan texts and artifacts collected between 1920 and 1940 in Kalimpong and Tibet. It aims to provide a view of the Van Manen collection through a study of its rare manuscripts, the material objects, undocumented marginal writings, and the unique Tibetan language autobiographies by ordinary Himalayan people commissioned by Van Manen.

The project's goal is the examination of the van Manen Collection as a whole using historical, ethnographic and philological methods, and by employing Digital Humanities methods through which the origins of the texts and artifacts can be traced, mapped, and be made available, linking them to other editions in online databases as well as to local Tibetan archives. The main aim is to get an understanding of the proliferation, usage, and presence of religious and ritual literature and artifacts in the greater Darjeeling area in the first half of the 20th century and, by extension, their religious milieus.
The PhD candidate will work mainly with the rare and unusual Tibetan language manuscripts in the collection. S/he will make an inventory of the manuscripts that are either rare or unique and try to trace the geographical and textual origins of these manuscripts with the help of the PI. This will be done through 1) an examination of the ephemera that discuss the methods Van Manen’s assistants used to collect manuscripts 2) fieldwork: interviewing households that still own similar manuscripts in the greater Kalimpong area to retrieve information on the context of these ritual texts, and 3) locating similar manuscripts in existing databases such as that of the BDRC. Under the guidance of the PI, the PhD candidate will select particularly important Tibetan language texts, analyze, contextualize, and (as appropriate) translate them.

The PhD candidate will be based in Leiden where s/he will join a research team that will consist of four members: one PhD candidate, two post-doctoral researchers, and the project leader. S/he will participate in regular teammeetings and present his/her research findings at scholarly venues, as well as in field trips to India.
Requirements
An MA degree in Buddhist Studies, Tibetan Studies, Religious Studies or comparable. Candidates near completion of the degree will be considered
Excellent command of written Tibetan, both classical and modern
Fluency in spoken and written English
Broad knowledge of Tibetan religious and cultural history
Knowledge of (or willingness to learn) spoken Tibetan, Nepalese or Lepcha will be considered an asset
Some experience in working with Tibetan religious texts
Demonstrable interest in manuscript culture and literary production in culturally Tibetan regions
Willingness to work in an international research environment
Willingness to spend a limited amount of time teaching in the 2nd and 3rd year of the 4-year PhD trajectory
Willingness to help organize the yearly workshops
Ability to work independently and as part of and in support of a larger team

Professor of Contemporary Performing Arts,"University of Groningen
Since its foundation in 1614, the University of Groningen has established an international reputation as a dynamic and innovative university offering high quality teaching and research. Its 37,000 students are encouraged to develop their individual talents through challenging study and career paths. The University of Groningen is an international centre of knowledge: it belongs to the best research universities in Europe, and is allied with prestigious partner universities and networks worldwide. For additional information, see this link: https://www.rug.nl/about-ug/work-with-us/new-staff/. The University of Groningen has a strong commitment to the principles and practices of diversity and inclusion throughout the University community and welcomes candidates who enhance that diversity.

Faculty of Arts
The Faculty of Arts is building on a longstanding tradition of four centuries. Its mission is to be an ambitious top-ranking faculty in terms of both education and high-quality research, with a strong international orientation, firmly rooted in the North of the Netherlands. The faculty creates and shares knowledge through outstanding education and high-quality research, benefitting society.

Arts, Culture and Media
The ACM program is unique in the Netherlands with its doubly interdisciplinary structure: it combines a variety of theoretical and methodological perspectives with a broad range of art disciplines where students choose two art forms in their BA studies from music, theatre, film, literature or the visual arts. This rich interdisciplinary and inter-art setting calls for a scholar with openness to interdisciplinarity. Some of the overarching questions studied by the ACM staff are: How do we define the arts and what are their functions? Which roles do the arts play in the lives of individuals, for specific social groups and within society as a whole? How do related media impact the experiences and evaluation of the arts, and how do contemporary and newly emerging art forms relate to each other and the evolution and history of the arts? How have developments such as intermedial art, participatory art, digital art, performance art, sound art, or new media art transformed the arts in recent years? How do these new and emerging forms of arts deal with questions of climate disaster, post-colonialism, gender inequality? Related to this broad range of questions the new chair should also show commitment to thinking about historical changes in discussions about the arts and share a strong commitment to studying how the arts contribute to societal values and individual worldviews.

The Faculty of Arts in the University of Groningen invites applications for the position of Full Professor of Contemporary Performing Arts (Theatre/Music/Dance). This is a full-time and permanent post.

The successful candidate has an excellent, proven track record in the field of Contemporary Performing Arts, both in research and teaching, and has excellent leadership and mentorship qualities. The new professor comes with a rich and varied experience of working in multidisciplinary teams and is able to work in different fields. The chair holder is expected to lead a dynamic team of researchers with varied research interests and disciplinary backgrounds, and to promote and serve the long-term interests of the team and its members within the Faculty of Arts and beyond.

Research
The research task of the professor covers 40% of the appointment. Research in the field of Arts, Culture and Media (ACM) is housed in the Groningen Research Institute for the Study of Culture (ICOG) and, within this, in the Research Center for Arts in Society with theme groups such as ‘Music, Sound and Culture,’ ‘Film and Contemporary Audiovisual Media,’ and ‘Arts, Culture and Cognition.’ Furthermore, members of the Department of Arts, Culture and Media participate in various national research schools, such as the Research School for Media Studies (RMeS) or the Netherlands Institute of Cultural Analysis (NICA). The new chair will actively contribute to at least one of them. The new professor is expected to secure funding for research projects through research proposals in cooperation with academic or non-academic institutions within and outside the Netherlands. The candidate should therefore have experience in setting up national and international research programmes and obtaining funding. An extensive national and international network is essential.
The new chair will also actively seek PhDs students and explore new ways for joint or double degrees.

Teaching
Teaching covers 60% of the appointment (minus compensated management tasks), and the candidate is expected to teach and lead development of courses at all levels in the department. The ACM department provides education at the Bachelor level in the form of the international BA Arts, Culture and Media, the four minors and pre-master programmes, four MA tracks and two Research Master tracks. The new chair will be teaching in the BA program and in one or more of the four MA tracks in ‘Arts & Culture’: ‘Music, Theatre and Performance Studies’, ‘Arts, Cognition and Criticism’, ‘Arts, Policy and Cultural Entrepreneurship’, and ‘Film and Contemporary Audiovisual Media’, as well as the Research MA ‘Arts & Culture’ with its two tracks ‘Arts, Media and Literary Studies’ and ‘Cultural Leadership.’ Which courses the candidate will be teaching will depend on the profile of the candidate and needs of the program.

Management
The new professor leads the chair group Contemporary Performing Arts (Theatre/Music/Dance) and performs service and administrative tasks within and outside the Faculty of Arts. The new chair holder will play an active role in promoting the regional, national and international prestige of the chair group by initiating and contributing to existing societal and networking activities and will represent the chair group through their contacts with academic institutions and societal partners in the Netherlands and abroad.

The position
We seek a candidate with an international reputation as a research leader and a clearly demonstrated record of accomplished teaching and administration.

The professor will:
coordinate and teach courses in the BA and MA programmesinstigate, coordinate, and conduct research in the field of Contemporary Performing Artssupervise and co-supervise PhD studentsfoster the professional development of the members of the chair groupobtain external funding for researchdeepen and extend existing teaching and research collaborations across the universitydevelop existing national and international scholarly networksfulfil organizational roles within and possibly outside of the facultyrepresent and promote the chair group of Contemporary Performing Arts in fostering and expanding national and international contacts.

The Faculty of Humanities, Leiden Institute for Area Studies (LIAS) is looking for a postdoctoral researcher to focus on the influence of the Purāṇas on the literary and material cultures of Southeast Asia for the ERC Advanced Grant project “PURANA – Mythical Discourse and Religious Agency in the Puranic Ecumene” (grant number 101054849).
Project Description
The Purāṇas constitute the most voluminous and enduring genre of Sanskrit literature. While many important Purāṇas were first recorded and circulated in the first millennium CE, the genre has remained a living tradition through the colonial period until the present day. Despite the tradition’s centrality for cultural production in South Asia, we know very little about their historical embeddedness. PURANA makes a critical intervention in the field by tracing the composition, transmission, translation, and agency of the Purāṇas as a transregional and transhistorical process involving multiple actors, audiences, and geographic contexts. Adopting a longue durée perspective, we argue that the Purāṇas’ mythical discourse underlies and unites the religio-political culture of the Sanskrit Cosmopolis—establishing what we call a ‘Puranic Ecumene’: a vast part of the inhabited premodern world united by a distinctive mythical discourse, a hegemonic vision of the integration of society and cosmos, and a remarkable way of anchoring the present in the continuing ancient past.
Key Responsibilities
The postdoctoral researcher will carry out research on the reception and re-creation of Indic Puranic narratives in Southeast Asian literary and material culture. While the Old Javanese Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa appears to be a unique case of direct translation of a known Sanskrit Purāṇa into Old Javanese, court poetry (Kakawin) in general attests to the massive impact of the Purāṇas on Javanese religion and society. Reception of Puranic narratives is also attested in epigraphic sources, temple arts, and iconographic programmes. The ideal candidate would make use of the large collection of Old Javanese manuscripts and Southeast Asian archival materials in the Leiden University Library special collections and the museums of the Netherlands. In addition to doing research, the candidate will have the opportunity to teach within the LIAS.
Selection Criteria
PhD in a relevant field (South and Southeast Asian Studies, Religious Studies, Art History).
Prior experience in conducting historical research with primary literary and/or material sources.
Excellent command of English as well as command of a relevant Southeast Asian language. Reading knowledge of Sanskrit is preferred as well.
Interested in working collaboratively with a multidisciplinary team exploring primary sources and their broader socio-historical contexts.
Our Organization
Leiden Institute for Area Studies (https://www.hum.leiden.edu/lias/) is comprised of a School of Asian, a School of Middle-Eastern Studies and a School of Religious Studies, with international staff and student populations. The institute is committed to a present-day vision of area studies, integrating disciplinary and regional-historical perspectives on a solid foundation of excellent language skills. Current staff in LIAS has expertise in the fields of Anthropology, Archaeology, Art Studies, Buddhist Studies, Film Studies, History, International Relations, Language Pedagogy, Law, Linguistics, Literary Studies, Material Culture Studies, Performance Studies, Philology, Philosophy, Political Economy, Religious Studies, Sociology, and Visual Culture Studies.
The Faculty of Humanities is rich in expertise in fields such as philosophy, religious studies, history, art history, literature, linguistics and area studies covering nearly every region of the world. With its staff of 995, the faculty provides 27 master’s and 25 bachelor’s programmes for over 7,000 students based at locations in Leiden and in The Hague. For more information: https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/humanities.
Terms and Conditions
We offer a fixed term 1 fte position for a period of 3 years, starting as soon as possible.
The starting salary is € 3.974.- gross per month (pay scale 11, step 0), based on fulltime employment, in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities and commensurate with qualifications and experience. Depending on qualifications, you may start at the appropriate step in scale 10 until you fully meet the requirements for scale 11 as specified by the Faculty of Humanities, particularly with regard to the number of years of relevant work experience.

The Amsterdam School of Historical Studies (ASH) currently has a vacant Postdoc researcher position as part of the Dutch National Research Agenda (Nationale Wetenschapsagenda, NWA)-funded project Foreign Fighters in Ukraine: Mobilisations, Combat experiences, and Return trajectories, led by main researchers Dr Samuël Kruizinga (UvA) and Dr Elanie Rodermond (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam/NSCR). ASH is one of the five Research Schools within the Amsterdam Institute for Humanities Research.
What are you going to do?

Since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, thousands of volunteer ""foreign fighters"" – including an unknown number of Dutchmen – have joined Ukraine’s International Legion. The research project Foreign Fighters in Ukraine: Mobilisations, Combat experiences, and Return trajectories’ central aim is to study both foreign fighting generally and increase our understanding of the International Legion specifically. Specifically, it aims to ascertain how the unique Ukrainian battlespace and the (social) media landscape shape mobilisations, combat experiences, and return trajectories of this iteration of the foreign fighter phenomenon.
You will, on the basis of currently available, but disparate historical data sets on foreign fighters in the 19th and 20th century, as well as contemporary information on returning Islamic State volunteers, set up hypotheses related to this project’s central aim. Then you will test these by making creative use of contemporary open sources on foreign fighter involvement in the Russo-Ukrainian war, including social media posts. Crucially, you will contact and then interview actual, potential and/or returning Dutch members of the International Legion.
Your research will be indispensable in increasing policy makers’ as well as mental health and legal experts’ ability to understand the ramifications of foreign fighting on both systemic and personal levels. Societal stakeholders in the overall project are ARQ Nationaal Psychotrauma Centrum, the Dutch national centre for specialist diagnostics and treatment of people with complex psychotraumatic complaints, ARQ Kenniscentrum Oorlog, Vervolging en Geweld, the prime Dutch knowledge centre for research on the psychosocial impact of war on individuals and society, the T.M.C. Asser Institute, which specialises in international (humanitarian) law and operates at the interface of academia, legal practice and governance, and the Nederlands Veteraneninstituut, which promotes the social recognition of combat veterans, and has expertise in and developed a working methodology for sensitive, post-mission interviews with combat veterans. Together with these stakeholders and project leaders Kruizinga and Rodermond you will contribute to a workshop to be organized by all subproject partners to bring together historical, legal, psychological, psychiatric, political and social science, experiential and government perspectives on foreign fighting in Ukraine and beyond; to a joint policy brief resulting from the workshop designed to disseminate public knowledge and influence policy; and to a podcast on foreign fighting.

Your tasks and responsibilities:
participating in meetings with the project leads and partners;
conducting research, presenting intermediate research results at workshops and conferences and publishing a single-authored, peer reviewed article;
co-organising knowledge dissemination activities (workshop, policy brief, podcast).

What do you have to offer?

We are looking for a team player with a research interest in the lived experiences of volunteers, who enjoys the challenges of new research areas and formats, relishes working within an interdisciplinary team, and is interested in communicating results to both various scientific communities and to a wider public.

Your experience and profile:
a PhD in history, criminology, anthropology, law, or related fields;
a strong cooperative attitude and willingness to engage in collaborative research;
experience with semi-structured interviews in research settings;
near-native command of Dutch (required for the interviews) and English.
research interests related to foreign fighting, either in the past or the present;
excellent qualitative research skills demonstrated by a track record of publishing in high-ranking journals and/or with leading presses or a demonstrable capacity to develop such a record;
enthusiasm for communicating academic research to non-academic audiences.

What can we offer you?

The Postdoc researcher will be appointed at the Department of History, European Studies and Religious Studies of the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Amsterdam and will conduct the research in Amsterdam School of Historical Studies (ASH). The employment contract is for one year and 26.6 hours a week (= 0.7 fte). Preferred starting date is either 01 June 2023 or 1 September 2023 depending on the availability of the selected candidate.
The gross monthly salary, based on 38 hours per week and relevant experience, ranges between € 3.703 to € 5.439. This sum does not include the 8% holiday allowance and the 8,3% year-end allowance.

an enthusiastic, inspiring and professional academic team;
the opportunity to collaborate with leading researchers at research institutes that - partly as a result of their interdisciplinary approach - are world renowned.
