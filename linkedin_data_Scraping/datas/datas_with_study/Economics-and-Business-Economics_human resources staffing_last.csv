Manager economics (5+ jaar) voor gerenommeerd adviesbureau,"Het groeiende economicsteam van een gerenommeerde strategiepractice zoekt een manager. Combineer inhoud, projectleider en maatschappelijk relevantie met vraagstukken waar belang van economie, bedrijf en burger een rol spelen.
Over de opdrachtgever
Onze klant is een van de meest gerenommeerde adviesbureaus wereldwijd. Onderdeel van hun strategieclub is het economicsteam en dat richt zich op economische vraagstukken op het snijvlak van het publieke en private domein. Opdrachtgevers van dit team zijn grote, gereguleerde ondernemingen en instellingen, zoals Vattenfall, NS, Marktplaats en PostNL, maar ook toezichthouders, ministeries en investeerders.
Vraagstukken gaan veelal over mededinging, regulering en staatssteun. Je opdrachten hebben dus altijd een aanzienlijke maatschappelijke relevantie, waarbij het belang voor de Nederlandse economie en dat van de burger een grote rol spelen. Het economicsteam bestaat momenteel uit tien man en heeft een sterke groeiambitie. Daardoor is er behoefte aan versterking van de middenlaag en zoekt dit team een manager economics in Amsterdam.
Over de functie
Als analytische manager met financieel-economische achtergrond, werk je aan economische vraagstukken, breng je commerciële focus aan en stuur je je team aan. Je opdrachten gaan over onderwerpen als marktordening en -regulering, dominantie, fusiemeldingen, economische impactanalyses en publieke kosten-batenanalyses. Uitstekende rapportage- en presentatievaardigheden zijn dus essentieel. Je schakelt daarbij met specialisten vanuit andere disciplines (zowel intern als extern), afhankelijk van het type vraagstuk.
Naast die centrale, inhoudelijke rol coach en begeleid je je teamleden. Je bent verantwoordelijk voor de inhoudelijke lijn en het management. Een mooie rol voor een analyticus met sterke economische achtergrond. Bijvoorbeeld iemand die nu bij een economisch adviesbureau werkt en hier inhoud en het aansturen van een team graag combineert. Of iemand bij een ministerie of binnen een corporate organisatie op de regulatory affairs afdeling, die zich met economische vraagstukken bezig houdt.
Voorbeelden van opdrachten
Ministerie van Economische zaken: C02-heffing voor de industrie, moeten we dit invoeren ja of nee?
Ministerie van Infrastructuur en Waterstaat: Hoe zorgen we ervoor dat de NS de juiste keuzes maakt? Hoe moeten we dit vanuit de overheid aansturen?
PostNL: over de recente fusie van PostNL en Sandd was veel te doen in de media. Het economicsteam was in dit proces trusted advisor van de CEO. Hoe moet je deze fusie verdedigen naar de toezichthouder? Zowel bekeken vanuit de economie als vanuit de burger en de organisatie zelf.
Belangrijkste criteria
Je hebt minstens 5 jaar relevante ervaring met economische analyse, bijvoorbeeld bij een gerenommeerd (economisch) consultancybureau, beleidsafdeling of toezichthouder.
Je bent analytisch sterk en analyseert problemen bij voorkeur met behulp van concepten uit de (financieel)economische theorie.
Je beschikt over ervaring met projectmanagement: je weet teamleden te motiveren en de verwachtingen van je opdrachtgevers te managen. Natuurlijk werk je graag in een team en heb je een gezonde dosis humor.
Je hebt uitstekende schriftelijke rapportagevaardigheden en bent in staat om je werk helder te presenteren.
Je beschikt over een relevant netwerk binnen de overheid (ministeries, toezichthouders) en/of het bedrijfsleven.
Reden van de vacature
Het economicsteam van de strategiepractice bestaat momenteel uit tien man en heeft een sterke groeiambitie. Om de middenlaag te versterken zoekt het team een manager economics.
De procedure
Na een gesprek bij Badenoch + Clark volgen er drie bij deze opdrachtgever. Een business case maakt onderdeel uit van de procedure.
