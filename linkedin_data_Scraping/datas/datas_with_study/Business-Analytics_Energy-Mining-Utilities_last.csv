Leiding geven aan een nieuw op te zetten team
Waarom kiezen voor Eneco
De energietransitie is in volle gang en Eneco loopt voorop. Ons doel? In 2035 volledig klimaatneutraal zijn. Dat geldt voor onze eigen bedrijfsactiviteiten, maar ook voor de energie die wij aan onze klanten leveren. Zo ontwikkelen we zelf wind- en zonneparken, en helpen we klanten elke dag duurzame stappen te zetten met slimme producten en goed advies. Eneco Finance heeft de afgelopen jaren enorm veel geïnvesteerd in moderne financiële systemen. Het is nu zaak om die systemen volledig aan te wenden om de informatie en analyses te genereren die Eneco nodig heeft om haar strategische doelen te behalen. Als Team Lead Finance Data & Analytics ga je de strategische koers op het snijvlak van data en finance meehelpen bepalen.
Dit ga je doen

Als onderdeel van ons strategische Finance transformatieprogramma, willen we binnen Finance een nieuw team oprichten op het gebied van Data & Analytics. Voor dit nieuwe team zoeken we een Team Lead.

Dit nieuwe team moet gaan zorgen voor makkelijke toegang tot betrouwbare data, informatie en inzichten voor de gehele finance organisatie, o.a. door middel van strakke data governance, state-of-the-art systemen en doeltreffende visualisatie.

Op het gebied van data governance is al een belangrijke basis gelegd binnen het transformatieprogramma. Het is aan de Team Lead D&A om deze bereikte resultaten te verankeren in de organisatie, en verder te ontwikkelen.
We zijn in de laatste fase van het implementeren van een nieuw financieel systeem. Dit systeem moet, naast efficiënte en effectieve rapportage, flexibele en veelzijdige analyses mogelijk maken. Het D&A zal een belangrijke rol vervullen in het ontsluiten van data uit het nieuwe systeem.
Ook op het gebied van visualisatie zal het D&A team een belangrijke rol krijgen. D&A zal samen met de Business Controllers nieuwe doeltreffende dashboards gaan ontwikkelen, om de besluitvorming van het management nog beter te ondersteunen.
Zodra de basis is gelegd, zullen we ook gaan kijken naar praktische toepassingen van advanced analytics binnen finance.

De Team Lead FD&A zal het nieuwe team zelf gaan vormen. Zij/hij zal een belangrijke rol vervullen in het vormgeven van deze nieuwe functie binnen finance, alsmede in het bepalen van de exacte scope van de werkzaamheden van het team. Zij/hij zal daarbij ook de verbinding maken met afdelingen binnen Eneco die reeds actief zijn op het gebied van data (bijv. IT), om zo optimaal samen te werken. De Team Lead FD&A zal rapporteren aan de Director Group Control.

Gaat dit over jou?
