 PARADOX HAS ONE GOAL: EMPOWERING PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATIONS TO LIVE THEIR TRUE AMBITIONS.
But where do we start?

It needs to change, and we’re here to make it happen!
️ OUR AMBITION IS TO MAKE SUCCESS THE ONLY POSSIBLE OUTCOME FOR OUR CLIENTS (WHATEVER SUCCESS MEANS FOR THEM), BY CRAFTING INNOVATIVE & CAPTIVATING BREAKTHROUGH EXPERIENCES.
In other words, we want to make personal growth as entertaining as watching Netflix.
How, you might be wondering?
We travel the world and surround ourselves with top entrepreneurs (Richard Branson - Founder of Virgin, Marc Simoncini - Founder of Meeting, Fred Mazzella - Founder of BlablaCar), world athletes (Frederick Bousquet - World record in 50m free swimming, Frank Leboeuf - WorldCup Footballer), and artists (Barry Osborne - Producer of Lord of the Rings and Matrix) ;
We reverse engineer their strategies for achieving success and lean on the latest researches about neuroscience ;
We deliver trainings & educational contents around soft skills (critical thinking, productivity, leadership, public speaking, coaching, stress management), self-growth and performance, through a balanced set of e-learning programs, events and edutainment videos .
From one inspiring and well-known Founder to a team of +60 people today (and counting!), this approach has paid off and enabled us to exceed 2 million followers on social networks, and to have thousands of people attending our online events and training courses.
And here are the vessels we embarked on to complete our mission:
