 Job description
Job description
In this project, we aim to predict the response of clinically used anti-cancer medications and radiation in 3D fresh tumor cultures of non-small cell lung cancer. Culture methods have recently been developed to grow cancer tissue as tumor slices or tumor organoids.

These human tumor cultures will be characterized further, followed by assessment of their susceptibility for common anti-cancer drugs and radiation with photons or protons. The lab results will subsequently be correlated with clinical outcomes of patients for validation of the methods as predictive assays.

 Job description
Job description
Each year, more than 30,000 patients with ischemic stroke are admitted in a Dutch hospital and this number is increasing. Endovascular thrombectomy is a new treatment that was introduced in 2015 and strongly improves functional outcomes of stroke patients. However, major challenges remain. One of the most prominent is that despite a successful endovascular thrombectomy one to two thirds of patients still have a poor outcome. Moreover, further down the clinical management of stroke patients, identifying those individuals who benefit most from rehabilitation and providing patients with realistic outcome estimations are also of great importance. In this PhD project you will contribute to solving these challenges. You will analyse large clinical and radiolodical data sets to optimize endovascular therapy and rehabilitation trajectories based on pre- peri- and post-interventional parameters.

The PhD project is one of the five PhD positions in the ICAI Stroke Lab, one of the ROBUST program's labs. The ROBUST program on Trustworthy AI-based Systems adds 17 new labs to the ICAI’s current ecosystem. The aim of the ICAI Stroke lab is to improve the outcome of stroke patients by optimizing the whole chain from the 112-call to rehabilitation with AI. Specifically, we intend to develop and assess AI-based patient stratification (faster, more accurate) for acute stroke care interventions, AI based functional outcome prediction after endovascular therapy, image-guidance in endovascular interventions for better therapeutic outcome and data-driven individualized stroke recovery policies, based on patients’ current abilities and on constantly updated prognostic models for stroke recovery. In addition, we will study the acceptance of such AI-models by clinical decision-makers. There will be strong collaboration between the PhD students in the ICAI lab.
Work environment

 Job description
Job description
In this PhD project, we will investigate novel AI methods for application in stroke interventions .The main challenges to be addressed are improving image guidance by including pre-operative image information, and models to assess procedural result and predict outcome. By reducing complexity from the information source during the procedure, outcome can be optimized. Furthermore, a realtime analysis of all the pre- and intra-operational information sources (images, intra-body measurements) by AI methods and a translation to the current patient can contribute to treatment success.

This PhD project is one of the five PhD positions in the ICAI Stroke Lab, which is one of the labs in the ROBUST program. The ROBUST program on Trustworthy AI-based Systems adds 17 new labs to the ICAI’s current ecosystem.

The aim of the ICAI Stroke lab is to improve the outcome of stroke patients by optimizing the whole chain from the 112-call to rehabilitation with AI. Specifically, we intend to develop and assess AI-based patient stratification (faster, more accurate) for acute stroke care interventions, AI based functional outcome prediction after endovascular therapy, image-guidance in endovascular interventions for better therapeutic outcome and data-driven individualized stroke recovery policies, based on patients’ current abilities and on constantly updated prognostic models for stroke recovery. In addition, we will study the acceptance of such AI-models by clinical decision-makers. There will be strong collaboration between the PhD students in the ICAI lab.
Work environment

 Job description
Job description
In the Netherlands (17.4 million inhabitants), almost 400.000 individuals live with the consequences of a stroke that affect their daily functioning due to problems with movement, cognition, and language. To minimize the consequences of a stroke, stroke patients must receive the right treatment from the right professional at the right time, both early post-stroke but also often in the months and years later.

In this Ph.D. position, you will investigate trajectories of stroke recovery with AI. This should enable data-driven individualized stroke rehabilitation and integrated stroke care pathways based on current patients’ abilities and predicted stroke recovery. AI-based prognostic models should support clinical decision-making to select the right therapy to the right patient at the right time, amongst others focusing on 1) optimal patient discharge policies to home, nursing home, or rehabilitation center, and 2) optimal individualized rehabilitation treatment selection within the different treatment settings relevant to stroke patients (e.g., rehabilitation centers, nursing homes or first-line treatment such as physical therapy).

This PhD project is one of the five PhD positions in the ICAI Stroke Lab, one of the ROBUST program's labs. The ROBUST program on Trustworthy AI-based Systems adds 17 new labs to the ICAI’s current ecosystem.

The aim of the ICAI Stroke lab is to improve the outcome of stroke patients by optimizing the whole chain from the 112-call to rehabilitation with AI. Specifically, we intend to develop and assess AI-based patient stratification (faster, more accurate) for acute stroke care interventions, AI based functional outcome prediction after endovascular therapy, image-guidance in endovascular interventions for better therapeutic outcome and data-driven individualized stroke recovery policies, based on patients’ current abilities and on constantly updated prognostic models for stroke recovery. In addition, we will study the acceptance of such AI-models by clinical decision-makers. There will be strong collaboration between the PhD students in the ICAI lab.

 Job description
Job description
Each year, more than 30,000 patients with ischemic stroke are admitted in a Dutch hospital and this number is increasing. Acute treatment with intravenous thrombolytics and endovascular thrombectomy improves the functional outcomes of these patients. The beneficial effects of these treatments are highly time dependent, so every patient needs to be treated as soon as possible (‘time = brain’). Although randomized trials on the efficacy of these treatments showed overall time-dependent beneficial effects, the expected benefits for individual patients may vary. Intravenous thrombolytics can be provided in almost all Dutch hospitals, but endovascular thrombectomy only in specialized intervention centers. Decisions about prehospital triage, ambulance transportation and acute treatment need to be taken under time pressure, both in the field as in the hospital. We need better tools to support clinicians in their decision making, taking the characteristics of individual patients into account.

In this PhD position, you will integrate patient data from pre-hospital and in-hospital sources into decision support tools to tailor treatment to the risks and needs of every individual patient. This PhD project is one of the five PhD positions in the ICAI Stroke Lab, one of the ROBUST program's labs. The ROBUST program on Trustworthy AI-based Systems adds 17 new labs to the ICAI’s current ecosystem. The aim of the ICAI Stroke lab is to improve the outcome of stroke patients by optimizing the whole chain from the 112-call to rehabilitation with AI.
