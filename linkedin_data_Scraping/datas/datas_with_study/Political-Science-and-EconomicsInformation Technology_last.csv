As the world’s largest food waste-fighting app, we connect stores that have unsold, surplus food with consumers who buy and enjoy it. Our community of 73 million users has saved more than 198 million meals from going to waste across 17 countries, but there’s still a lot more we want to achieve.

Globally, more than a third of food is wasted, and climate experts agree that combating food waste is one of the most important things we can do to address the climate crisis. For us, it’s simple: the bigger we get, the better placed we’ll be to make a huge difference.

That means we’re looking for talented people with diverse skills and backgrounds to join us in the fight against food waste.

You have proven ability to influence, manage, build and improve relationships with stakeholders from politics, business, and civil society
You have excellent written & verbal communication and negotiation skills, with rigorous English and Dutch (proficiency in Danish, Swedish or Norwegian is a plus)
You are someone who enjoys deep-diving into emerging topics, political trends, upcoming regulations, and challenges
You are a self-starter with a high level of initiative who functions autonomously and has a collaborative mindset.
