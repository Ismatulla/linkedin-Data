Senior Economic Consultant Scenarios and Asset Valuation,"Would you like to join a dynamic company that provides advisory services to a diverse, international client base comprised of pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, banks, and asset managers? Are you passionate about simplifying and solving complex problems, while delivering exceptional client service? Are you interested in building your consulting expertise in the exciting fields of economic scenarios and asset valuation? Do you stay up-to-date with global economic developments and financial news? If you answered yes to these questions, we invite you to consider joining us as our Senior Economic Consultant for Scenarios and Asset Valuation.
What do we have to offer?
As a senior economic consultant, our clients see you as their trusted advisor on our scenario-based risk and return expectations and their positioning against the current macroeconomic environment. The quantitative economic scenarios that you will be advising on are a crucial input in the financial decision making for many applications such as ALM, risk management, and financial planning. Example applications include analyzing exposure to which asset classes fits best with investment goals, and whether investment goals are attainable with the current strategic asset allocation.

As a project leader, you are responsible for the management of sales and client servicing projects. Examples are running trials of our scenarios for potential new clients, the onboarding and implementation of new clients, and projects that improve the services that we provide to our global client base, such as rolling out a new stress testing suite. In doing so, you have the opportunity develop yourself technically, economically, and financially, since our quantitative scenarios cover every asset class that typically is part of the portfolios of our global client base.
In your role, you coach other consultants and build relationships with key clients to work on a long-term partnership. This involves personal responsibility for one or more client accounts. You ensure that our clients are satisfied with the products and services that we provide. To do so, you will work closely with other consultants and our quantitative analysts to help our clients understand and use our quantitative economic scenarios as well as the software that our clients use to work with these.

We offer you plenty of room and autonomy to fully apply your talents and highly value an enterprising spirit. You will be given responsibilities immediately and you will be personally and actively mentored in the process.

The Scenarios and Asset Valuation Solution
You will be part of our Scenarios and Asset Valuation (SAV) Solution, which is a group of about 25 persons with an academic background. SAV is an innovative multidisciplinary group with Consultants, Quantitative Financial Analysts, and Quantitative Developers as well as Software Developers.

We provide both real-world and risk-neutral economic scenarios to enable our clients to manage the complexity of investment decision making. Our real-world scenarios provide risk and return projections that dynamically adjust to the latest economic and financial market circumstances. This includes the effects of ‘externalities’ such as central bank interventions or the Covid-19 pandemic and has a global coverage of asset classes for many different regions. We achieve this by integrating characteristics of realistic market behavior (“stylized facts”) into forward-looking asset prices, yield curves, and volatilities as well as into the broader macro-economic environment. Our risk-neutral scenarios enable actuaries and finance professionals to perform market-consistent valuations of optionality in insurance liabilities and of financial contingent claims more generally.
For a flavor of what we do, please refer to our introduction video, quarterly webinars or Insights.
What’s in it for you?
We offer you a challenging and rewarding role in a growing company, while being part of an inspirational global business with a lot of opportunities for personal and professional career development.

The salary range is € 77.000 - € 120.000 on a yearly basis (including variable pay, 13th month, holiday allowance), dependent on your role, competencies, and experience.

In addition to a competitive salary, we offer you excellent benefits, including:
An open and informal work environment (Active staff association, annual ski trip, staff social events, annual summer and Christmas party and much more) with inspiring, smart and enthusiastic colleagues
Opportunities to develop yourself with a training program as well as weekly research and knowledge-sharing meetings
Hybrid working (working from the office in Rotterdam or Amsterdam with possibility to partly work from your home office)
The prospect of a permanent contract, because we strive for a long-term collaboration
Participation in the pension scheme, commute and business travel allowance, working from home allowance, 27 vacation days and the possibility to buy more.
Who are you?
Do you enjoy keeping up-to-date with global economic trends and financial news? Are you energized by engaging with customers and building lasting relationships? Your exceptional social and communication skills enable you to articulate complex matters with ease to clients and senior stakeholders. If this sounds like you, we want you to join our team as Senior Economic Consultant Scenarios and Asset Valuation.

5-7 years of relevant work experience
