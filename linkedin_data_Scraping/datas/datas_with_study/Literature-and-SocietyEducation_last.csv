PhD position in sustainable governance of major steel infrastructures,"PhD position in sustainable governance of major steel infrastructures
 Apply Now
Fancy how the Erasmus bridge, wind turbines, or major steel infrastructures in general are (re-)built, used, and governed? Come and find out how they can be sustainable and circular designed and used!
Job description
We are looking for a four-year full-time PhD candidate. Your PhD research project will be an integral part of the NWO Key Technologies programme named Sustainable and Reliable Macro steel infra-structures. SUBLIME brings together a huge ambitious consortium, consisting of four Dutch universities, municipalities and provinces, port authorities, engineering firms, and national and multinational firms. Large steel infrastructures (bridges, sheet piles, lock doors) degrade in time through corrosion and fatigue. The goals of the project are to increase the sustainability and circularity of these infrastructures and to develop governance recommendations that operationalize the technical knowledge. To achieve this, SUBLIME takes a comprehensive approach by considering technical, socioeconomic, environmental, political, and governance aspects. In the project, predictive digital twins will be developed that integrate structural health monitoring and prediction models. This enables a much longer – but safe – use of these infrastructures. The consequent socioeconomic and environmental benefits will be assessed as well. This unique combination of transdisciplinary fields will result in specific technical and governance recommendations to achieve sustainable and reliable steel infrastructures, recommendations of high societal need.

In your PhD research, you will help to develop a governance framework and strategies for reliable and circular steel infrastructures, the overall goal of Work Package (WP) 3 in SUBLIME. The main problem WP3 wants to solve is to overcome the issue that important technical and socioeconomic knowledge is not translated into achievable change, an issue that is not uncommon in research. Therefore, we seek someone who is able to enact a dialogue between on the one hand the more technical researchers in the project, wherein the digital twin and the different technologies will be developed, and on the other hand the public and private stakeholders, with which together (policy) recommendations will be formulated.

Your tasks will be twofold. First you will need to understand and analyse the network wherein the different steel structures (two case studies) are part of. This involves understanding where materials and products come from / or go back to, how they are transported, where they are stored, but also what is the use of the infrastructure (e.g. the geographical economic relevance). For this you will closely work with the other PhD in WP3, who will be based at the CML in University of Leiden. Next, this first task also considers the actor-network of the bridge, from a more abstract perspective: who owns the technologies, who owns the (critical) materials, who makes or maintains (parts of) these major steel infrastructures, what skills are needed, who are the shareholders, what are relevant regulations, etc. The second task is more proactive. Here all the gained knowledge from your research and new insights from the other WPs need to be translated in action and policy recommendations. What is specifically needed to achieve sustainable and circular designed and used major steel infrastructures in The Netherlands? In this task, you will interact more and more with relevant stakeholders, take part in workshops, be part of expert sessions, in general thus go into the field and co-create change.
Requirements
It is expected that you will:

Execute a thorough literature study as well as performing initial interviews with all relevant research, private, and public consortium partners to start to understand the different perspectives, challenges, and problems of steel infrastructures.
Map, visualise (e.g. Illustrator, GIS), and analyse the flows and stocks of materials, where stakeholders are located, what institutional structures are relevant, etc.
Develop policy recommendations that are relevant for all consortium members, cf. recommendations regarding education, regulation, investments, R&D.
Efficiently communicate, verbally and in writing, the scientific results with your supervisors and with the consortium members during regular progress meetings, as well as to publish in peer-reviewed scientific journals.

The following qualifications are a plus:

MSc. in spatial or social sciences, such as geography, spatial planning, (economic and/or sustainability) governance, spatial management, or urbanism. But enthusiasm weights more!
Experience with working with economic and/or spatial data, such as visualisation or database-construction.
Eager to conduct a multidisciplinary project.
Have a proven level in writing and speaking English.
An enthusiast team player who can also work independently.

Doing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and a final thesis. For more details please check the Graduate Schools Admission Requirements.
Conditions of employment
Doctoral candidates will be offered a 4-year period of employment in principle, but in the form of 2 employment contracts. An initial 1,5 year contract with an official go/no go progress assessment within 15 months. Followed by an additional contract for the remaining 2,5 years assuming everything goes well and performance requirements are met.

Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities, increasing from € 2541 per month in the first year to € 3247 in the fourth year. As a PhD candidate you will be enrolled in the TU Delft Graduate School. The TU Delft Graduate School provides an inspiring research environment with an excellent team of supervisors, academic staff and a mentor. The Doctoral Education Programme is aimed at developing your transferable, discipline-related and research skills.

The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance and sport memberships, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged. For international applicants we offer the Coming to Delft Service and Partner Career Advice to assist you with your relocation.

Postdoc: Update of an existing systematic review,"Do you have experience in the conduct of systematic reviews?

We are looking for a post-doc who can update an existing etiologic review which examines risk factors for cervical artery dissection (i.e. a rare form of CVA/stroke).


Location: AMSTERDAM

FTE: 0.6 - 0,8
Job description
If so, we would like to hear from you, which you can do so by applying for an available position at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU).


About the project: Cervical artery dissection (CAD) is an increasingly recognized cause of ischemic stroke among the young and middle-aged individuals. The reason why these dissections occur in otherwise healthy appearing young individuals remains unknown, although numerous risk factors have been postulated. It is easy to understand why certain risk factors may predispose a patient to dissection. For example, connective tissue provides mechanical stability and elasticity to the vessel wall; therefore, structural impairments could lead to weaknesses at points of decreased resistance, resulting in rupture. However, other risk factors are more difficult to explain (e.g. a recent infection, trivial trauma, or common neck movements, which are pervasive in society).


In short, a number of risk factors have been identified as a cause of CAD, and it would appear that CAD is a result of different mechanisms. In order to get a better understanding of the risk factors and potential pathways, we conducted a systematic review which was published in 2005. In this review, we identified 31 studies which examined various risk factors. Since then, many new publications have appeared which could provide new insight and strengthen our understanding, which is why an update of this review is necessary.


Note: This review has been cited close to 300 times (source: Scopus), so the review has had significant scientific impact.


Your duties

About your role: The postdoc will be responsible for updating the existing review; meaning, searching the literature and identifying new studies, and updating the risk of bias assessment and extract the qualitative and quantitative data. Experience in conduct of systematic reviews is necessary, and preference will be given to those with knowledge in etiological reviews. Additionally, conduct of reviews requires a team player, and the expectation is that the candidate can work well with another team member.
Requirements
A PhD in Medicine, Health Sciences, Medical informatics or related study;
Able to function well both in a team as well as independently, and possess good communication skills;
Proven experience in conduct of systematic reviews;
Knowledge of statistical packages, such as Review Manager or STATA is a plus;
Affinity with the topic on risk factors for stroke is a pré.
What are we offering?

The Faculty of Humanities, Leiden Institute for Area Studies (LIAS) is looking for a postdoctoral researcher to focus on the influence of the Purāṇas on the literary and material cultures of Southeast Asia for the ERC Advanced Grant project “PURANA – Mythical Discourse and Religious Agency in the Puranic Ecumene” (grant number 101054849).
Project Description
The Purāṇas constitute the most voluminous and enduring genre of Sanskrit literature. While many important Purāṇas were first recorded and circulated in the first millennium CE, the genre has remained a living tradition through the colonial period until the present day. Despite the tradition’s centrality for cultural production in South Asia, we know very little about their historical embeddedness. PURANA makes a critical intervention in the field by tracing the composition, transmission, translation, and agency of the Purāṇas as a transregional and transhistorical process involving multiple actors, audiences, and geographic contexts. Adopting a longue durée perspective, we argue that the Purāṇas’ mythical discourse underlies and unites the religio-political culture of the Sanskrit Cosmopolis—establishing what we call a ‘Puranic Ecumene’: a vast part of the inhabited premodern world united by a distinctive mythical discourse, a hegemonic vision of the integration of society and cosmos, and a remarkable way of anchoring the present in the continuing ancient past.
Key Responsibilities
The postdoctoral researcher will carry out research on the reception and re-creation of Indic Puranic narratives in Southeast Asian literary and material culture. While the Old Javanese Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa appears to be a unique case of direct translation of a known Sanskrit Purāṇa into Old Javanese, court poetry (Kakawin) in general attests to the massive impact of the Purāṇas on Javanese religion and society. Reception of Puranic narratives is also attested in epigraphic sources, temple arts, and iconographic programmes. The ideal candidate would make use of the large collection of Old Javanese manuscripts and Southeast Asian archival materials in the Leiden University Library special collections and the museums of the Netherlands. In addition to doing research, the candidate will have the opportunity to teach within the LIAS.
Selection Criteria
PhD in a relevant field (South and Southeast Asian Studies, Religious Studies, Art History).
Prior experience in conducting historical research with primary literary and/or material sources.
Excellent command of English as well as command of a relevant Southeast Asian language. Reading knowledge of Sanskrit is preferred as well.
Interested in working collaboratively with a multidisciplinary team exploring primary sources and their broader socio-historical contexts.

Developing organizational arrangements for artificial intelligence in public surveillance
Job description
We are looking for an enthusiastic PhD candidate with a background in the field of policy analysis, public administration, policy sciences or a related field to study and develop organizational implementation arrangements for Artificial Intelligence (AI) for regulatory surveillance. The position is a for 4-year PhD track, financed by the Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management, department of Multi-Actor Systems in close collaboration with regulatory agencies.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly used in regulatory processes. No wonder, AI promises a more effective regulatory supervision process, in which inspectors on the floor are advised on the basis of AI-generated risk analysis. Technically there are still many development possibilities. However, whether AI can be applied effectively and responsibly also raises organizational issues, such as:
Professionalism of the inspectors. Risk analyses were conducted before the AI era. These often took place in the minds of professional inspectors and/or during work meetings. In other words: not only data, but also inspectors are an important source of knowledge about risks. Their knowledge is often implicit and based on years of experience. Application of AI can count on resistance from professionals. Not only that: too aggressive application of AI can come at the expense of their valuable knowledge.
Data pollution. Too much risk-based supervision can lead to data pollution: data mainly comes in from those under supervision who have previously been identified as being high-risk. Other people under supervision can thus remain out of sight. They can change their behaviour. There will therefore always be a demand for risk-based random supervision, in which random samples are also used for supervision. Within an organization there are different ideas about the right ratio.
Ethical issues. There is a lot of discussion about bias, protection of vulnerable individuals, transparency and privacy. Of course, these discussions also exist internally. This means that those involved – data scientists, inspectors, managers – make trade-offs between values. Many decisions about data and algorithms can be leading for the outcomes. These decisions increasingly seem to be made 'at the front', the data experts. This presents challenges with regard to the management of the data experts.

Based on these signals, we conclude that further development of AI has both technical and organizational dimensions. Successful development and implementation of AI will therefore have to be linked to the organization of supervisory practices.

How are technical development of AI and the supervisory organization connected and how can this connection be improved? Much literature on AI focuses on technical possibilities, while other literature deals with ethical concerns. Far less literature discusses the actual implementation and use of AI in organizational practice. A study into this subject should have two characteristics:
The research is interdisciplinary. It has both innovative-technical aspects and social-scientific aspects. The question is about the interplay between the two.
Connected to practice. We are looking for the application of AI in the context of practice. That is why we want to conduct empirical research, using one or more cases. The research will be carried out in close collaboration with the Dutch Food and Product Safety Authority (NVWA).
Requirements
In this project you will study and develop arrangements that bring together the world of AI and managements of surveillance.

This requires understanding of AI (data science, machine learning, programming) and more intangible processes of organization, including organization structures, informal coordination and organizational politics. It includes both analysis and design efforts. It will involve conducting case studies at NVWA

We are looking for someone who:
has a Master's degree and a background in policy analysis, public administration or a related field
has affinity (and preferably also demonstratable experience) with AI
has affinity (and preferably also experience) with organizational science
has the ability and interest to cross disciplinary boundaries
is fluent in English, both written and orally
has pro-active communication skills and is able to work well in a team

Doing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and a final thesis. For more details please check the Graduate Schools Admission Requirements.

Since the project is developed in close cooperation with a Dutch inspection agency (NVWA) that mostly communicates in Dutch, a candidate that speaks Dutch or is willing to learn the Dutch language is preferred.
Conditions of employment
Doctoral candidates will be offered a 4-year period of employment in principle, but in the form of 2 employment contracts. An initial 1,5 year contract with an official go/no go progress assessment within 15 months. Followed by an additional contract for the remaining 2,5 years assuming everything goes well and performance requirements are met.

Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities, increasing from € 2541 per month in the first year to € 3247 in the fourth year. As a PhD candidate you will be enrolled in the TU Delft Graduate School. The TU Delft Graduate School provides an inspiring research environment with an excellent team of supervisors, academic staff and a mentor. The Doctoral Education Programme is aimed at developing your transferable, discipline-related and research skills.

The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance and sport memberships, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.

Are you an aspiring researcher, looking to start your academic career off well-prepared? As a junior lecturer / PhD candidate, you will not only conduct research into economics, but also teach your knowledge, skills and methods to students. This way, you will be able to obtain both your PhD and university teaching qualification in one position.

We are looking for multiple full-time PhD Candidates/Junior Lecturers in Economics and Business Economics. Over a period of six years, you will spend half of your time on research and the other half on teaching.

As a junior lecturer, you will convey contemporary knowledge, skills and methods to our Bachelor's students using traditional and state-of-the-art teaching tools. As a researcher, you will address one of the various contemporary challenges for academia and society. Besides using the traditional economist's toolbox, you will integrate theories and methods from other disciplines so that your research will allow for multidisciplinary perspectives.

We are convinced that economists from Radboud University can make a difference in dealing with today's societal and organisational challenges. We therefore train out-of-the-box thinking economists to become properly equipped academics who are well prepared for the future economics job market.

As a lecturer, you will give tutorials, assist in teaching courses, and supervise theses in the Bachelor's programme offered by the Department of Economics and Business Economics. As you gain more experience, you will get more responsibilities in teaching. Depending on your skills and expertise, you will also teach methodological courses (mathematics, statistics, and econometrics with R) next to content courses in economics (such as micro- and macroeconomics) and/or accounting and (corporate) finance. After six years, you will ultimately have developed sufficient teaching skills to obtain a university teaching qualification.

As a researcher, you will work on one of the following themes (PhD supervisors in brackets):
1) Organisational Economics (Prof. Robbert Maseland: robbert.maseland@ru.nl/Prof. André van Hoorn: andre.vanhoorn@ru.nl).
2) Accounting in Healthcare (Prof. Frank Hartmann: frank.hartmann@ru.nl).
3) Corporate Governance and Accountability (Prof. Frank Hartmann: frank.hartmann@ru.nl).
4) Health Economics (Prof. Natascha Wagner: natascha.wagner@ru.nl).
5) Digital Transformation in Economics (Dr. Sascha Füllbrunn: sascha.fullbrunn@ru.nl).
6) Climate Change and Economics (Prof. André van Hoorn: andre.vanhoorn@ru.nl/Prof. Robbert Maseland: robbert.maseland@ru.nl).

With your supervisory team, you will carve out your own research trajectory in the first year. This project description must be approved by the Scientific Advisory Committee of the Nijmegen School of Management. For each theme, the envisioned key elements of such a research trajectory are available upon request from the PhD supervisor concerned.
Profile

Corporations are increasingly being challenged to reflect on their purpose. Indeed, the relentless pursuit of profit as the raison d’être for corporations has had detrimental implications for our planet, society, and even shareholders – calling corporations to identify with a purpose that enables sustainable development. Accordingly, an ever-louder chorus of industry leaders have been questioning the shareholder-centric approach to business conduct. For example, Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, called on firms to serve a broader societal purpose and shared value creation, and leading business consultants are increasingly advising firms to pursue a purpose that helps to cultivate a deeper connection with employees, customers, and communities. Earlier research has shown that firms are responsive to this development as they are rolling out new purpose-driven strategies and implementing changes within their organizations. However, firms that are particularly challenged by this development are those operating in contested industries including, for example, energy, aviation, and fast food. For these firms, pursuing a purpose requires fundamentally rethinking their core business activities, revenue models, and strategy.

Therefore, this PhD project seeks to perform an in-depth, longitudinal study of how firms in contested industries engage in purpose-driven strategic renewal. The objective of this project is to identify and theorize about the challenges, practices, and consequences of implementing such renewal. We envision this project to draw from, and contribute to, the literature on stakeholder management, strategic renewal, and organizational change. An elaborate description of the project, including a brief literature review, and outline of methodology and societal relevance can be found here.

The Faculty of Law, Institute for Information Law (IViR), and the University Research Priority Area on Trust in the Digital Society (TRUST RPA: https://www.ivir.nl/trust-in-the-digital-society-new-uva-research-priority-area/ ) is looking for a postdoctoral researcher to study the institutional safeguards of trustworthy centralized and decentralized techno-social infrastructures.

The TRUST RPA is a five year long interdisciplinary research initiative to study how we trust is changing due to the emergence of new trust production technologies, and the disruption of existing trust relations.

The digital society relies on an ever-expanding network of digital infrastructures. This forces us to rethink some of our basic assumptions about one of the most fundamental resources in all interpersonal, social, economic relations: trust.
Despite their widespread use, we know little about the trustworthiness of our digital infrastructures. At best it is difficult to establish their trustworthiness (such as with AI), at worst they are proven to be untrustworthy (as is the case with social media).
Some of these digital infrastructures play key roles in interpersonal and societal trust dynamics. They disrupt existing trust relations and offer new ways to trust each other.
Our scientific methods and theories face serious limits when it comes to the study of change of social structures, institutions, and processes under the conditions of rapid technological transformation. Research on trust in technology and trust by technology is siloed, and focuses on narrowly defined technologies (AI), or problems (system security), and lacks a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, long-term-view.

This postdoctoral position (embedded in the TRUST RPA, supervised by both the Institute for Information Law, at the Amsterdam Law School, and at least one other participating faculty) will use empirical research to study how various new technological infrastructures disrupt or can enhance existing societal (impersonal, institutional) trust relations and strive to establish new forms of trust relations in society.

What are you going to do?

 The successful candidate will:
Conduct empirical, qualitative research (interviews, case studies, discourse analysis) on the dynamics of institutional, impersonal trust with regards to emerging digital technologies, such as digital platforms, web3 technologies, or Machine Learning based automated systems.
Coordinate the development, fieldwork and initial analysis of a large-scale longitudinal survey
Conduct work on the emerging European technology regulation framework (Digital Services Act, AI Act, Digital Markets Act) using doctrinal research, normative research and discourse analysis
Organize events, conferences
Participate in grant proposal development, international network building
Acquiree funding

The Postdoctoral researcher will be hired by the Faculty of Law, closely collaborating with two other postdoctoral researchers in the Trust RPA. The team will be supervised by the PIs of the TRUS RPA: Balazs Bodo, Associate Professor at the Institute of Information Law (IViR) at the Faculty of Law, Jan B. Engelmann, Professor of Neuroeconomics at the Amsterdam School of Economics, Theo Araujo, Associate Professor Communication in the Digital Society at the Amsterdam School of Communication Research (ASCoR), Tom van Engers, Professor in Legal Knowledge Management at the University of Amsterdam, and Marc Tuters, Assistant Professor in the New Media and Digital Culture Division of Media Studies at the Faculty of Humanities.

What do we require of you?

 The successful candidate has:
a PhD degree in law, or social sciences (sociology, economics, political science, communication science, science and technology studies or related fields)
strong empirical research skills;
familiarity with qualitative research methods,
familiarity with doctrinal research or policy research;
good knowledge of current developments in information markets and technology;
academic excellence, as shown in the grade transcripts and curriculum vitae.
a creative mind and analytical intelligence;
an interest in working in a multidisciplinary team;
willingness to learn new knowledge, and acquire new skills required by the project;
excellent written and spoken command of English, and ideally knowledge of Dutch
interest in working on interdisciplinary topics, in interdisciplinary teams.

Candidates, who have:
quantitative skills, including survey development, statistical analysis, and/or
familiarity with R, python or any other programming language, and/or
big data collection and analysis skills, and/or
previous experience in the private or public sector

will be given extra consideration in the application process.

We strongly encourage members of broadly understood minority socio-cultural groups to apply. We believe that there are several traditionally underrepresented, but incredibly forceful perspectives, that have transformed our respective disciplines. Recent scholarship by persons of colour, feminist, intersectionalist scholars, scholars from the Global South have highlighted fundamental issues with the design, operation, and impact of techno-social systems that remained in the blind spots of mainstream scholarship. Without such contributions, serious problems, such as racial bias in AI systems, would have gone unnoticed and left unaddressed by more careful technical design and better regulation.

Our offer

We offer a temporary employment contract for 38 hours per week for a period of 36 months with a probationary period of two months. The preferred starting date is as soon possible.
The gross monthly salary, based on 30,4 -38 (0.8-1 FTE) hours per week and dependent on relevant experience, ranges between € 2,960 to € 4,670 (scale 10). UvA additionally offers an extensive package of secondary benefits, including 8% holiday allowance and a year-end bonus of 8.3%. The UFO profile Researcher 4 is applicable. A favourable tax agreement, the ‘30% ruling’, may apply to non-Dutch applicants. The Collective Labour Agreement of Universities of the Netherlands is applicable.

Besides the salary and a vibrant and challenging environment we offer you multiple fringe benefits:
232 holiday hours per year (based on fulltime) and extra holidays between Christmas and 1 January;
Multiple courses to follow from our Teaching and Learning Centre;
Multiple courses on topics such as leadership for academic staff;
Multiple courses on topics such as time management, handling stress and an online learning platform with 100+ different courses;
7 weeks birth leave (partner leave) with 100% salary;
Partly paid parental leave;
The possibility to set up a workplace at home;
A pension at ABP for which UvA pays two third part of the contribution;
The possibility to follow courses to learn Dutch;

What else do we offer
the possibility to start up and grow a New Research priority Area at the UvA,
close working relations with five faculties of the UvA; and with TU Delft, and Erasmus University, Rotterdam
freedom to develop your own research agenda;
welcoming, international, dynamic teams;
an inspiring academic and professional environment in the heart of Amsterdam;
excellent possibilities for further professional development and education.

Professor of Contemporary Performing Arts,"University of Groningen
Since its foundation in 1614, the University of Groningen has established an international reputation as a dynamic and innovative university offering high quality teaching and research. Its 37,000 students are encouraged to develop their individual talents through challenging study and career paths. The University of Groningen is an international centre of knowledge: it belongs to the best research universities in Europe, and is allied with prestigious partner universities and networks worldwide. For additional information, see this link: https://www.rug.nl/about-ug/work-with-us/new-staff/. The University of Groningen has a strong commitment to the principles and practices of diversity and inclusion throughout the University community and welcomes candidates who enhance that diversity.

Faculty of Arts
The Faculty of Arts is building on a longstanding tradition of four centuries. Its mission is to be an ambitious top-ranking faculty in terms of both education and high-quality research, with a strong international orientation, firmly rooted in the North of the Netherlands. The faculty creates and shares knowledge through outstanding education and high-quality research, benefitting society.

Arts, Culture and Media
The ACM program is unique in the Netherlands with its doubly interdisciplinary structure: it combines a variety of theoretical and methodological perspectives with a broad range of art disciplines where students choose two art forms in their BA studies from music, theatre, film, literature or the visual arts. This rich interdisciplinary and inter-art setting calls for a scholar with openness to interdisciplinarity. Some of the overarching questions studied by the ACM staff are: How do we define the arts and what are their functions? Which roles do the arts play in the lives of individuals, for specific social groups and within society as a whole? How do related media impact the experiences and evaluation of the arts, and how do contemporary and newly emerging art forms relate to each other and the evolution and history of the arts? How have developments such as intermedial art, participatory art, digital art, performance art, sound art, or new media art transformed the arts in recent years? How do these new and emerging forms of arts deal with questions of climate disaster, post-colonialism, gender inequality? Related to this broad range of questions the new chair should also show commitment to thinking about historical changes in discussions about the arts and share a strong commitment to studying how the arts contribute to societal values and individual worldviews.

The Faculty of Arts in the University of Groningen invites applications for the position of Full Professor of Contemporary Performing Arts (Theatre/Music/Dance). This is a full-time and permanent post.

The successful candidate has an excellent, proven track record in the field of Contemporary Performing Arts, both in research and teaching, and has excellent leadership and mentorship qualities. The new professor comes with a rich and varied experience of working in multidisciplinary teams and is able to work in different fields. The chair holder is expected to lead a dynamic team of researchers with varied research interests and disciplinary backgrounds, and to promote and serve the long-term interests of the team and its members within the Faculty of Arts and beyond.

Research
The research task of the professor covers 40% of the appointment. Research in the field of Arts, Culture and Media (ACM) is housed in the Groningen Research Institute for the Study of Culture (ICOG) and, within this, in the Research Center for Arts in Society with theme groups such as ‘Music, Sound and Culture,’ ‘Film and Contemporary Audiovisual Media,’ and ‘Arts, Culture and Cognition.’ Furthermore, members of the Department of Arts, Culture and Media participate in various national research schools, such as the Research School for Media Studies (RMeS) or the Netherlands Institute of Cultural Analysis (NICA). The new chair will actively contribute to at least one of them. The new professor is expected to secure funding for research projects through research proposals in cooperation with academic or non-academic institutions within and outside the Netherlands. The candidate should therefore have experience in setting up national and international research programmes and obtaining funding. An extensive national and international network is essential.
The new chair will also actively seek PhDs students and explore new ways for joint or double degrees.

Teaching
Teaching covers 60% of the appointment (minus compensated management tasks), and the candidate is expected to teach and lead development of courses at all levels in the department. The ACM department provides education at the Bachelor level in the form of the international BA Arts, Culture and Media, the four minors and pre-master programmes, four MA tracks and two Research Master tracks. The new chair will be teaching in the BA program and in one or more of the four MA tracks in ‘Arts & Culture’: ‘Music, Theatre and Performance Studies’, ‘Arts, Cognition and Criticism’, ‘Arts, Policy and Cultural Entrepreneurship’, and ‘Film and Contemporary Audiovisual Media’, as well as the Research MA ‘Arts & Culture’ with its two tracks ‘Arts, Media and Literary Studies’ and ‘Cultural Leadership.’ Which courses the candidate will be teaching will depend on the profile of the candidate and needs of the program.

Management
The new professor leads the chair group Contemporary Performing Arts (Theatre/Music/Dance) and performs service and administrative tasks within and outside the Faculty of Arts. The new chair holder will play an active role in promoting the regional, national and international prestige of the chair group by initiating and contributing to existing societal and networking activities and will represent the chair group through their contacts with academic institutions and societal partners in the Netherlands and abroad.

Post-doctoral Researcher Dynamics in Water Governance,"Do you want to become part of a leading research group in the field of water governance? Do you feel that you want to contribute to groundbreaking research to make fresh water provision fit for the future? Do you want to join the research program AquaConnect that was funded by the Dutch Research Council (NWO) and collaborate with peers from multiple disciplines? Please apply for a fascinating position as “Postdoctoral Researcher Dynamics in Water Governance"" based at the Public Administration and Policy group (PAP) of Wageningen University. We seek a talented academic with a good track record in studying public governance of sustainability challenges. We are looking for someone with expertise in water governance, who is able to apply conceptual frameworks from the fields of Public Administration and the Policy Sciences to the analysis of the drive for circular water management.

Background: governance of circular water management
Water shortages can cause major societal disruption. To enhance socio-hydrological resilience, it is imperative that regions start preparing for situations in which freshwater is insufficiently available to serve critical segments of society for certain periods of time. Without greater resilience to ever more extreme climatic and hydrological events, increasing societal and economic risks and damages loom. A step change is needed in the way freshwater is managed and conserved, including innovative solutions that enhance regional resilience, can be scaled up, and exported to other parts of the world. The development and testing of innovative technologies in the project AquaConnect is aimed to contribute to this agenda, and will be implemented in direct collaboration with stakeholders and end users.
The postdoctoral researcher would not only join Wageningen University, but would also become part of the AquaConnect project. AquaConnect is a NWO-funded research consortium in which researchers from different disciplines from 7 Dutch universities and over 40 other stakeholder organizations participate. The program’s overall aim is to develop innovative technical solutions, perform integrated assessment and assess transformative potential of various options to increase the resilience of the Dutch fresh water provision in times of increasing risks of water stress.

We will recruit for the vacancy ourselves, so no employment agencies please. However, sharing in your network is appreciated. Tasks

The postdoctoral researcher will study how changes come about in water governance systems that enable the introduction and upscaling of novel technologies. To this end, the literature on dynamics in water governance will be systematically reviewed, relevant conditions (such as problem pressure, political perceptions, the presence of policy instruments) that create or hinder such dynamics will be identified, and a database of relevant case studies (nationally and internationally) will be built and subjected to comparative analysis (for instance QCA). On the basis of the findings, the postdoctoral researcher will work together with various colleagues in the project to produce hands-on guidance for stakeholders in the Netherlands on how to make upscaling more likely, guidance that will be developed in close coordination with such stakeholders on the basis of several workshops. Finally, the postdoctoral researcher will actively share responsibility for coordination between several parts of the AquaConnect project and work closely with some of the other postdoctoral researchers on this. So the tasks are for you to:
Engage in conceptual and empirical scientific research on water governance dynamics, particularly as they affect the introduction and upscaling of novel water management technologies in freshwater management;
Publish the results from your research in the form of conference papers, contributions to scientific journals, but also popular publications and presentations.
Produce hands-on guidance for stakeholders in the Netherlands on how to make upscaling a reality, guidance to be developed in close coordination with such stakeholders on the basis of several workshops.
Participate in the organization of scientific and practice-oriented events (workshops, conferences), in close collaboration with other consortium members and relevant stakeholders in the AquaConnect project and at the PAP group;
Actively support the coordination between various parts of the AquaConnect project, in close coordination with colleagues, in part by being based at the Deltares institute in Utrecht for one day per week.

In this light, we seek a candidate who has:
a PhD-degree in the field of the relevant social sciences (for instance public administration, policy studies, development studies, political science, science and technology studies, transitions management, etc.).
an excellent understanding of relevant conceptual frameworks and theories around the EU governance of sustainability transformations in the climate-food-water nexus.
a growing publication record in international refereed scientific journals.
strong didactic and presentation skills and enthusiasm for teaching and working with (international) students in a broad range of educational programs.

Enabling structure preserving computation in Bayesian inverse problems
Job description
In applications such as image processing and materials science, we wish to understand a complex system from noisy observations. This is the challenging setting of inverse problems. The PhD project concerns employing a Bayesian approach to such inverse problems with general, non-Gaussian priors, with the aim of preserving structure available in the information. Examples of non-Gaussian priors are Besov priors which
allow function discontinuities (similar in spirit to the TV regularization used in image processing). Additional challenges may be how to deal with situations where the likelihood is not differentiable or the likelihood computation is of black-box type and/or has no gradient information available.

One of the main challenges you will address is how to design suitable (Monte Carlo) algorithms for carrying out computations for such models. After first performing an exploration of the existing methods and literature available on the topic, the project may focus more on theoretical or applied aspects, depending also on the interests of the student.

This project is part of the Delft AI Lab ‘SLIMM-Lab’, a collaboration between Hanne Kekkonen and Joris Bierkens (Delft Institute of Applied Mathematics) and Iuri Rocha and Frans van der Meer (Civil Engineering and Geosciences). The goal of SLIMM Lab is to employ machine learning approaches towards efficient computation in materials science. The current PhD position focusses on some of the mathematical underpinnings
of these approaches.
Requirements
MSc degree in mathematics with a specialization or strong affinity with one of the following: statistics, probability, machine learning analysis or numerical analysis.
Affinity with coding numerical methods, e.g. in Python, C++, or Julia.
Interest or experience in teaching and guiding students combined with a strong scientific drive.
Ability to work in a multidisciplinary and diverse team.
Good English proficiency, both verbally and in writing.

Doing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and a final thesis. For more details please check the Graduate Schools Admission Requirements.

The goal of this project is to develop a new adaptive and collaborative weather radar network for the Netherlands in which individual radars can adapt their behavior and react (in real-time) to what the other sensors in the network are seeing or doing. This is an open challenge in the current literature, that can be applied also to other scenarios of radar-based surveillance of manmade objects and not only to atmospheric phenomena. Compared to traditional radar networks in which each radar follows a fixed, predefined measurement plan, adaptive networks offer substantial advantages for high-resolution monitoring of rapidly developing localized phenomena, such as heavy rain and hail.

At TU Delft we have unique research facilities with many different types of radars including polarimetric S-band, X-band and C-band precipitation radars, vertically profiling micro-rain radars and cloud radars. But what is missing at the moment is the 'brain' that can control them, and adapt their operations and processing as a function of scientific needs and user requirements. The development of the tools and algorithms that can turn several independent radars into a truly cooperating, cognitive radar network is the focus of this PhD.

During this PhD, you will work in the Microwave Sensing Signals and Systems (MS3) research group at the Department of Microelectronics of TU Delft. This group has extensive research facilities and excellent track record on the full pipeline of microwave and radar sensing, from hardware development to signal processing and automatic object classification.

Your main responsibilities will be to:

Develop codes, databases and strategies to adapt the configuration of radars in a network and decide the best scanning strategies as a function of the current weather situation, taking into account scientific needs and user priorities.
Formulate mathematical models for key radar parameters, feature extraction, and target identification/tracking for atmospheric threats in heterogeneous radar networks.
Experimentally validate methods using numerical simulations and in-situ observations.
Collaborate with another PhD student within the same project in the Department of Geoscience & Remote Sensing (CITG Faculty) to exchange knowledge, perform joint experiments and make sure all project objectives are met.
Participate in knowledge utilization activities and disseminationof research findings.

Relevance: the monitoring and prediction of heavy rain and hail has great scientific value and clear societal benefits. In the Netherlands alone, heavy rain and hail cause millions of damages every year. Because of global warming, the frequency and intensity of such events will gradually increase over the next decades. SMARTER will help increase our scientific knowledge of these destructive phenomena, which will lead to better damage mitigation and climate adaptation strategies.

Candidates are also encouraged to look at another related PhD vacancy within the same project, in the group of Dr. Marc Schleiss at the Dept. of Geoscience & Remote Sensing (CITG Faculty):

Job description
To meet environmental targets for CO2 emissions set forth, alternative, low-carbon emission approaches to existing manufacturing processes for base chemicals are required. This necessitates re-invention of processes that are in use since early days of the industrial revolution. Particularly novel separation methods for products from electrochemical synthesis routes need to be developed & demonstrated at pilot scale for industrial uptake. Within TU Delft, we collaborate with industrial partners and multiple research groups in the Pro2Tech institute. The position will form a bridge between research groups in the Chemical Engineering department, and the Process & Energy department of the Mechanical Engineering faculty.

To scale up CO2 electrolysis & utilization technologies, we are looking for a proactive, process engineering-minded postdoc to join our team. We expect both scientific and engineering work, that will focus on first classifying separation technologies available for isolating CO2 electrolysis products. Based on the gathered knowledge, the postdoc will identify separation processes most suitable for scale up for products from CO2 electrolysis. Furthermore, the postdoc will demonstrate integration of continuous lab scale end-to-end process from a CO2 rich feed to a chemical intermediate.

You will work together with a diverse team of scientists interested in electrochemical conversion and separation technologies. The team consists of four scientists Monique van der Veen, David Vermaas, Ruud Kortlever and Burak Eral collaborating in the context of Pro2Tech. Given the rapid development and large interest in the technology, we expect you to publish in scientific literature or present the technology to the general public, hence good communication skills in addition to scientific and engineering talent is required.
Requirements
A PhD degree, in chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, applied physics, physical chemistry or similar.
Experience with classical and electrochemical/physiochemical separations (e.g. adsorbtion, cryo-distillation, membrane separations, pseudo capacitative deionization etc.).
Strong system-thinking skills: overviewing the whole process.
Hands on experimental experience with electrochemical systems is considered a plus.
Knowledge of process technology.
Pro-active and creative mind-set.
Fluent in English. Speaking Dutch is a plus.
Starting soon is possible.
