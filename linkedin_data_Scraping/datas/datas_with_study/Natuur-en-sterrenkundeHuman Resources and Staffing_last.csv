Job description
We are looking for a tenure-track Assistant to Associate Professor with outstanding knowledge of and experience in microbial biotechnology and who aims to develop and implement novel approaches to discover, screen and engineer unexplored natural compounds, which have great potential for specific applications. For instance, combinatorial methods can be used to (re)design natural products to also aid natural product diversification and effectiveness and eventually improved production. The newly appointed staff member will be able to connect to ongoing studies in molecular microbiology (Profs. Arnold Driessen, Dirk-Jan Scheffers, and Tessa Quax), microbiomes (Prof. Sahar El Aidy, Dr. Frans Bianchi), molecular systems biology (Profs. Matthias Heineman, Andreas Milias), molecular enzymology and biotechnology (Prof. Marco Fraaije and Dr. Max Fürst), chemical biology (Profs. Giovanni Maglia), and synthetic biology (Dr. Sonja Billerbeck). Furthermore, the work connects to structural-function research (Profs.
