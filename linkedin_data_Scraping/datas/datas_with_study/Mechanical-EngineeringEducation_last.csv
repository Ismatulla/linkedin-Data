Job description
Agriculture is an indispensable industry. Open field agriculture, however, requires large quantities of fertilizer, water, and land while representing a significant contribution to global greenhouse gas production. Moreover, open field agriculture is particularly sensitive to climate change as rising temperatures, floods, and droughts threaten food security in many areas of the world.

Controlled environment agriculture (CEA), such as greenhouse or vertical farming, offers a climate resilient alternative to open field agriculture with significantly lower fertilizer, water, and land use requirements. One of the main limitations of CEA, however, is that optimizing and maintaining climate conditions for plant growth is a complex and energy intensive task. While model-based and optimal control methods offer a potential solution, the large investment of time and expertise (i.e., cost) required to deploy these methods is prohibitive for applications such as CEA with many independent systems and high variability between systems.

This PhD project involves designing data-driven and modular control algorithms to address these challenges in CEA systems. These control algorithms should regulate the indoor temperature, humidity, CO2 concentration, and supplemental light input in CEA systems to maximize plant growth while minimizing energy cost and environmental impact. The goal is to leverage first-principles knowledge as well as advances in machine learning and data-driven control to design a control synthesis procedure specific to CEA applications. We plan to focus on modular approaches that allow us to apply the same low-cost control synthesis procedure to deploy controllers for a variety of CEA systems and plants with similar physics, but different parameters. During the project, we intend to collaborate with industrial partners and Wageningen University and Research (WUR) to test these algorithms on real CEA systems. By reducing the cost to deploy these advanced automation and control algorithms, we can expand the scope of these algorithms and thereby bring significant improvements to the resilience, economics, and sustainability of modern agriculture.
Requirements
Applications should have:

Completed a relevant MSc degree in systems and control, engineering, applied mathematics, or a related field.
A strong background or interest in systems & control and machine learning
A desire to work in a multidisciplinary project
Knowledge of controlled environment agriculture is a plus, but not required.

Doing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and a final thesis. For more details please check the Graduate Schools Admission Requirements.

 Apply Now
Help the police solve crimes better! Join us as a PostDoc and develop a microfluidic platform for fast analysis of body fluids on crime-scenes.
Job description
Identification and analysis of body fluids at crime scenes are multi-step procedures that require presumptive and/or confirmatory tests. These tests can be destructive, rendering follow-up tests impossible, or give false positive results. Immunoassays and mass spectrometry-based methods are currently used in forensic laboratories, but require sophisticated labeling/sample preparation.

In this project, you will be developing a portable microfluidic platform for on-scene identification and analysis of multiple analytes in body fluid traces (e.g., blood). This device (Microgel-based Etalon Spectrophotometry in Microfluidic Appliance (MESMA)) consists of a sensing element (stimuli-responsive microgels) and a separation element (membranes). The membrane provides sample pre-treatment (concentration), and the microgels are for sensing and detection of the analytes. The target analytes selected for proof-of-principle in this project are “sex hormones”, and “stimulants (amphetamines, cocaine)”. This will enable forensic investigators/police to immediately identify the gender of the victim/suspect and whether they were drugged ruling out potential engaged individuals at the early stage. Contrary to current alternatives, this platform will not need mixing samples with test fluids and will keep samples intact for multi-testing. With this project you will not only significantly advance body fluids analysis science, but you will contribute to a safer society, and will increase the affordability and effectiveness of our judicial system.

You will work under the supervision of dr. Hanieh Bazyar and dr. ir. Arjo Loeve in a joint project between the departments of Process and Energy (P&E) and BioMechanical Engineering (BME) at the faculty of Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering (3mE). This position will be embedded in the Engineering Thermodynamic section of the P&E department (ETh/3mE). This research will be enabled and supported by the facilities of both departments: state-of-the-art membrane and microfluidic research facilities of the P&E department and the well-equipped laboratories at the BME.
Requirements
Requirements:

A PhD in a relevant field, i.e. Biomedical engineering, Chemical engineering, Chemistry, Materials engineering, or a related discipline.
Knowledge in a filed that strongly relates to the project, e.g., forensics, biology, microfluidics, membrane based separation technologies, etc.
Demonstrated ability in written and spoken English.
Ability to work independently and in a team.

Having the following is a plus:

Knowledge of microfluidic chip design, fabrication and experiments
Clean room working experience.
Knowledge of stimuli-responsive polymers.

€ 2,541 - € 3,247
Deadline
30 Apr 2023

Freshwater is crucial to sustain life, economic development and the environment. It’s also a vulnerable resource whose availability and quality varies strongly around the globe. We need to understand the natural and socio-economic processes that affect water resources and develop solutions for water scarcity, flooding and pollution. Our team develops and applies holistic approaches which promote sustainable and resilient management of water systems. Particularly, we study the dynamics of supply and demand of water resources in interaction with climate, land use, energy transition and agricultural management as well as production, trade and consumption. The methods we use include water footprint and life cycle assessment, hydrological modelling and integrated assessment. We understand water-related grand challenges as a shared responsibility, so we engage different partners and sectors to develop both science-based and useful solutions. To support decision-making, we provide data, models and tools and share our knowledge in academic teaching and science dissemination.

The position

Compensation as a policy tool to maintain environmental qualities started in the 1970s to protect wetlands. The idea of compensating for adverse impacts became very successful and forms the basis of current no-net-loss targets for biodiversity and net-zero targets for greenhouse gases. While appealing to both public and private policy makers, the efficiency of compensation in reaching the 1.5-degree target of the Paris Agreement and the no-net-loss target for biodiversity is contested, as they might delay much needed transformative action.

This PhD position aims to understand what role carbon and water-offsetting can play in environmental policy set out to meet climate and water targets. You analyse legally required and voluntary initiatives on carbon and biodiversity offsetting and take various levels (product, company, and national level) into account. You evaluate existing policies quantitatively based on their contribution to reach environmental targets and you will seek to understand why some compensation schemes are economically and/or environmentally successful and others are not. As water offsetting is currently not used widely, there is great potential to influence policies that are currently under development with your scientific research. A major innovation of your PhD could be to transfer learnings from carbon and biodiversity offsetting to water. You will distil lessons learned (e.g., what are promising accounting principles, certification procedures and other aspect underpinning success stories) and derive criteria that ensure that compensation is beneficial for people and ecosystems.

Your profile
We are looking for an enthusiastic, highly motivated hardworking PhD candidate to join our team. Our new colleague is driven by curiosity and has the following profile:
Hold (or are about to finish) a Master’s degree in a field relevant to the PhD topic
A background in one or more of the following topics is desired: Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and environmental footprints (esp. water footprint), environmental economics, international and cooperate climate and environmental policy, market-based environmental policy instruments
Enjoy working in a multidisciplinary research setting with an international research team to achieve both scientific excellence and policy relevance
Curiosity to apply quantitative and qualitative methods to market-based environmental policy
Ideally experience with publishing scientific papers
Proficient in written and oral English and strong professional) communication skills
Driven by the chance to improve the effectiveness of environmental policy with your research
Our offer
We offer a full-time 4-year PhD-position, with excellent mentorship and a stimulating research environment. We encourage high responsibility and independence, while collaborating with colleagues, researchers, other university staff and partners.
The gross monthly salary will be ranging from € 2.541,00 (first year), increasing each year up to € 3.247,00 in the fourth year. Salary and associated conditions are in accordance with the collective labour agreement for Dutch universities (CAO-NU).
You will have a minimum of 232 leave hours in case of full-time employment based on a formal workweek of 38 hours. A full-time employment in practice means 40 hours a week, therefore resulting in 96 extra leave hours on an annual basis.
We offer excellent fringe benefits including a holiday allowance of 8% of the gross annual salary, an end-of-year bonus of 8.3%, a solid pension scheme, healthcare benefits, free access to sport facilities and a family-friendly institution that offers parental leave (both paid and unpaid).
Information and application

Technologies such as fully autonomous, unattended train operation rely on the development and gradual implementation of several state-of-the-art sensing, signaling and safety technologies in several European countries. One of the major challenges is to gain the support of multiple stakeholders for innovations given the technical complexity and scale of their implementation. Smooth and effective deployment of these technologies therefore relies on smart implementation strategies that take into account the (societal) costs and benefits, as well as the timing and locations where these systems are deployed. To meet this challenge, a socio-technical approach needs to be developed that takes into account these challenging goals and requirements.

The PhD project focuses on (1) The development of methods and tools to evaluate the costs and benefits of technological innovations such as Automated Train Operations (ATO) for European railway stakeholders, and (2) The development and evaluation of migration strategies for the transition to more autonomous forms of railway operations. The research is supported by the European Joint Rail Undertaking of the European Union, which allows an international knowledge exchange with international railway partners.

"Senior Recruiter for Professors (0,8-1,0 fte)","Job description
Do you have a passion for recruitment? Are you looking for new experiences within talent attraction, like you have never had before...?

… you might ask yourself what makes this opportunity unique?
Recruiting professors is an experience most recruiters have not had before. Academia is culturally vastly different than industry. The environment offers significant freedom and flexibility. You will have the chance to build up relationships not only with your hiring managers, but also the various departments managing directors and deans. Through your credibility you will become a trusted partner for them, helping and advising them regarding their hiring choices. After all, it is the people that create the culture.
As an experienced recruiter, you’ll attract scientific staff from all over the world. You will actively search for qualified academic candidates (assistant, associate, and full professors) on a global scale. Your passion for searching and sourcing passive candidates will contribute to your success. You will be involved in pre-selection and will interview candidates, frequently together with your hiring manager. Additionally, your drive for achievement will help to ensure that your hiring managers are engaged and committed throughout the entire process. You have a very independent role, yet you are supported by your recruitment colleagues. You will be joining a small but connected team, that appreciates the fun factor as well!

The path to a successful hire can be a rather lengthy journey. This means that you have significant time to build up relationships with your candidates, since often the candidate journey is 6+ months.

Challenge: “Kiss & ride” concept to move containers from barge to terminal and vice-versa

Change: New design will cause change in the entire port logistics

Impact: Make autonomous port operations happen
Job description
To flatten the curve of climate change, urgent actions are needed. In 2019 the European Commission (EC) launched the European Green Deal (EGD) strategy to overcome climate change challenges. Complementary to this the Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy was published in December 2020. Greening transport is one of the key objectives of the EGD. Transport accounts for 25% of the EU’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The objective of the EGD is to reduce the GHG emissions of transport by 90% by 2050. Waterborne transport accounts for approximately 13% of EU’s transport GHG emissions, which equals to more than 3% of the total EU GHG emissions.

In this context, seaports will play a major role in boosting the use of cleaner technologies, green energy carriersand logistics concepts in maritime transport (sea), port operations (transshipment and storage) and hinterland transport (road, rail, barge, and pipeline) to reduce GHG emissions.The Port of Rotterdam, the largest seaport in Europe with many transport connections for all modes of transport, is frontrunner in the energy transition and has the vision to become a zero-emission port by 2050. Together with the Fellow Ports HAROPA, Sines and DeltaPort (inland port),the Port of Rotterdam supports theEGD sustainability goals. The intention is to perform a large range of pilot projects as input for a Masterplan toward zero emissions in 2050 by 45 consortium partners working together in the MAGPIE project.

MAGPIE will create demonstration and pilot projects in the living laboratory environment ofthe Port of Rotterdam, to advance technological, operational, digital and organisational aspects of energy supply for use in ports and reduce emissions.

This PhD project is focused on developing terminal approachand transshipment concept that enables to instantly and autonomously load and unload small-scale barge within a kiss and ride concept, incorporating seamless integration possibilities with terminal operations (stack). The autonomous transshipment equipment is interconnected with purpose-designed inter-terminal barges operating at the ‘non-sea-side’ and autonomous trucks.

The design of autonomous transshipment infrastructure will be anew concept design and not automating an existing one.The design will mainly focus onthe design of dedicated equipment for autonomous loading/unloading of the autonomous barge, however it will take in consideration the interaction with surrounding systems (the barge size, optimal position, orientation and location, system for autonomous mooring/unmooring etc.), hereby contributing to reaching port logistics sustainability goals. An integrated design of the equipment for autonomous quick loading/unloading of container(s) will include positioning, orientation as well as structural integrity, and will be developed using advanced design tools including systemdynamics analyses,advanced analytical modeling, FEA modeling and multi-body simulations. The integrated system design will include system design level for overall functionality and a generative design for the individual equipment. The design will consider ; system level from logistics point of view, equipment and cargo level. The innovative concept is envisioned to include the structural design of the equipment, as well as all interfaces, sensors, actuators and controllers for autonomous loading/unloading.

The design will be validated using a model-scale demonstrator setup at TU Delft lab facilities to showcase the innovative concept design for autonomoustransshipment. The transshipment system will be tested with the interaction of the existing TU Delft fleet to show the potential for scaling up towards real-size implementation in the Port of Rotterdam by collaborating with the consortium partners.
Requirements
Applicants for this position should have the following:

MSc in mechanical engineering, maritime technology, mechanical design, system engineering or related areas.
Good communication and writing skills in English.

PhD positions for human interactive materials,"Job description
Research background
Soft robotics is a relatively new subfield of robotics that deals with constructing robotic functions from compliant materials. Soft technologies and integrated soft systems can revolutionize the use of robotic devices, for instance in applications where elastic versatility and safe human/machine interactions are needed. It is predicted, and certainly has the potential, to lead to the development of radically new generations of machines. The examples are numerous. In the medical world, they will increasingly assist surgery, in-vivo therapeutic treatments or contribute to the rehabilitation of disabilities by exoskeletons. Soft robotic functions have the perspective to enhance the communication between man and machine or between machines mutually. We foresee that we can make materials that can feel, sense, behave and act as human skins, but with enhanced sensitivity and accuracy. They can be used as stand-alone and autonomous devices, but also be applied as coating or integrated with electronics or even with biological material to perform functions not accessible otherwise. And as a long-term perspective one can foresee the development of evolutionary self-developing soft robotics following nature’s approach to intelligent soft machines.
Projects description
In our research team we develop responsive materials that address the advancing needs in specialized medicine, man-machine communication and miniaturized mechanics. Smart soft materials are in potential capable to fill in gaps in present technologies and to generate new, specialized functions making use of their ability to adapt their shape, to comply to confined and sensible spaces and to provide their functional duty on location.
A key aspect of our projects is to translate molecular effects to macroscopic phenomena which, in turn translate into (robotic) devices. Consequently, the approach to successfully develop new robotic functions adapted to their field of application must be multidisciplinary, containing all the aspects from materials design/development, photonics, electronics and mechanics. In the material, the various molecular functions are brought together, and the soft robot is given a body, which can be as simple as a thin film actuator or coating, but also be complex consisting of a composite of materials in an accurate three-dimensional shape. It brings organic and inorganic materials together in hybrid materials, built around soft electronics. More information can be found at www.danqingliu.nl.

Job requirements
We are looking for talented, motivated and enthusiastic PhD and postdoctoral students who meet the following requirements:
Background in chemical engineering, physics, mechanical engineering, materials science or bioengineering.
Prior knowledge in soft matters, responsive materials and experience in microscopic techniques and device fabrication/ characterization are appreciated.
Ability to independently work within a dynamic team and multidisciplinary research environment.
Fluent in spoken and written English
Conditions of employment
We offer a challenging job for four years in a highly motivated team at a dynamic and ambitious university. You will work with innovative analytic equipment and you will be part of a highly profiled multidisciplinary collaboration where expertise of a variety of disciplines comes together.
