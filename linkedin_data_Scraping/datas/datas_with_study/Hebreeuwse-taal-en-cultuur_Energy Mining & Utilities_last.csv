Chief of Staff - Maternity Cover,"Become part of a European leader in fast charging and play a fundamental role in shaping our future towards sustainable mobility! Together with more than 170 colleagues from 35 nationalities, we enable electric vehicle drivers around Europe to fast-charge their vehicle with 100% renewable energy and lead the way in making mobility sustainable. We have recently been voted best charging network in the UK, in France and the Netherlands, which is a testimony to our drive to offer the best charging experience to EV drivers. Fastned is a fast growing, Euronext listed scaleup company.
This role can be either a maternity cover for around 7 months - a great stepping stone for other functions within Fastned - or an indefinite role right away as Internal Management Consultant (see our career page for other role).
We are looking for a Chief of Staff, who will serve as the right-hand to the CEO. As a strategist, consultant, and doer, you will ensure streamlined activities within Fastned based on the priorities of our CEO. As a member of our leadership team, you will be actively driving important projects, be an important element to our strategy development and enable effective communication between all stakeholders, such as the Supervisory Board, the Board of Directors, the Executive Team and management.

As our Chief of Staff you keep a pulse on the business and help connect the dots. You will handle portions of the day-to-day tasks that rest with the Board of the company and will keep the CEO on track. You make sure that strategic decisions are being executed by channeling, analysing and assimilating input from different stakeholders into effective business plans. You will support overseeing large, often cross-functional & organisation-wide projects, while monitoring and improving the information flow with key stakeholders. Sometimes you will act as a gatekeeper, ensuring our CEOs involvement in a project or decision-making process at the right moment.
In order to be effective in this high impact role you are a skilled relationship manager who can quickly integrate into our organization and build strong working relationships with those reporting to the CEO and others across the organisation. This diverse and fast-paced job requires excellent communication, strong analytical skills, a tolerance for ambiguity, high levels of organisation, and a can-do attitude, in which tasks both big and small are taken on with enthusiasm. You are willing to engage in high-level strategic discussions one day and to prepare presentation materials and other documentation the next. If you are looking for a challenging and rewarding opportunity to make a meaningful impact in a fast-growing organization, we encourage you to apply for this position.

Job requirements

We are looking for someone with curiosity and brains to very quickly gain a deep understanding of our business and who is able to combine this with diplomacy to communicate about findings and improvements in an effective manner. You know how to define strategies and put them into action while being in an advisory role. Furthermore, you have the ability to think on your own feet - you feel comfortable taking ownership.
Additionally, you tick the following boxes:

Able to start beginning of May 2023 at the latest;
4-6 years of previous experience in strategy consulting or a similar role within a scale-up or fast-paced business environment;
Masters degree in business (e.g., MBA) or from a technical university;
Outstanding organisational skills and a proven track-record of successful project management;
Excellent document drafting skills and advanced knowledge of Powerpoint/Keynote and Microsoft Excel;
Outstanding spoken and written language skills in English (Dutch is a plus not a must);
You are highly motivated by accelerating the energy transition.
Join us in building a better future

We work hard to change the world, but we don't forget to celebrate our successes, big and small. Our benefits include a pension plan (fully covered by Fastned) and participation in the company stock options program. We provide daily vegetarian lunches & the best coffee at our Amsterdam headquarters close to the Amstel station. In order to feel & enjoy the EV life you get access to our fully electric vehicle fleet (all charging expenses covered). Next to fun company events year-round, we organise an amazing yearly trip abroad. Other perks include flexible working hours, full travel compensation and the gear of your choice (MacBook vs Dell XPS, iPhone vs Android).

Fastned currently operates in six countries (Netherlands, Germany, UK, Switzerland, France and Belgium) and is growing fast. As a young, independent company with a flat organization structure, we give a lot of responsibility to our new hires and expect you to think for yourself.

Interested?

We would love to have a conversation with you! Apply now, send us your CV and explain in your motivation letter why you’re excited about joining our mission.
