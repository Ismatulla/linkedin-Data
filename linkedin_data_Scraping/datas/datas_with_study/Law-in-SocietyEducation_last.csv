PhD Law and Innovation in Quantum Technologies,"PhD Law and Innovation in Quantum Technologies

Opleidingsniveau: Master
Functie type: Promotieplaats
Sluitingsdatum: 24.04.2023
Vacaturenummer: 11246
Do you want to study one of the core legal questions in emerging quantum technology value chains? And do you want to contribute to a vision on how the law can support equitable development of quantum technologies?

This PhD position on Law and Innovation in Quantum Technologies is part of the new research group on the law and governance of quantum technologies at the Institute for Information Law, University of Amsterdam. The Institute for Information Law is one of the largest research facilities in information law world-wide. The Institute brings together more than 40 researchers from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds. The research group is a part of Action line 4 on the Ethical, Legal And Societal Aspects of Quantum Technologies of the Quantum Delta NL ecosystem.

What are you going to do

Intellectual property in the broad sense plays a vital role in advanced technology industries. Over the last years, public and private investment in quantum technologies, including quantum computing, communications and sensing, have received a significant boost. Innovation and development of quantum technologies is giving rise to specific questions of law and global value chains. Private sector quantum innovation strategies rely on strong protection through patents, trade secrets and other (quasi) intellectual property. This raises questions in relation to competition and equitable access to advanced quantum technologies across different stakeholders and internationally. National science and technology policies attempt to support thriving national and transnational quantum technology ecosystems, seeking protection for knowledge and skilled personnel. Concentrations of private power and geo-political competition around quantum technology development may lead a world of quantum haves and have-nots, increasing global inequalities. Early initiatives relating to quantum technologies at the international level include calls for responsible tech development, and recognition of human rights guarantees and Sustainable Development Goals.

Building on insights from the work on Law and Global Value Chains (GVCs), this PhD will engage with the following questions. What role do law and legal practice in the area of law and innovation (intellectual property, including trade secrets, contract law) play in emergent quantum technology ecosystems? What alternative arrangements are or can be imagined in relation to quantum technology intellectual property portfolio’s, in particular to further equitable development, open innovation and access to quantum technologies? How does law support different positions and strategies of relevant actors, and how do other governance tools, such as standardization, help relevant actors address tensions between security and other interests? How might a clash between open quantum innovation and securitization of quantum technology production be resolved, also in light of a new European imperative of strategic autonomy?

The PhD project will be part of the research group on the Law and Governance of Quantum Technologies at the Institute for Information Law (IViR) at the Faculty of Law of the University of Amsterdam. You will conduct original cutting-edge research into the law and governance of quantum technologies with a focus on emerging legal practices relating to quantum technology development. You will develop insights into the way in which law relates to the increasingly constitutive function of digital infrastructure in our societies, by conducting different case studies in the area of quantum computing, communications and sensing. Using relevant theory, information law and fundamental rights law, technology governance studies, and empirical methods, you will contribute to our understanding of law and quantum technology ecosystems in Europe and internationally.

What do we require

a completed degree in law, or equivalent degree;
affinity with questions of intellectual property and private law a knowledgeable curiosity for developments in quantum technologies;
knowledge of current legal developments with respect to technology and innovation;
excellent academic credentials, as demonstrated by grades and/or curriculum vitae;
a creative mind and strong critical and analytical skills;
an interest in working across legal disciplines, using different methods (including empirical, theoretical and interdisciplinary), and collaborations with other relevant non-legal disciplines. Some knowledge or experience with conducting empirical research is a plus;
strong communication skills and a commitment to contributing to diverse and inclusive team dynamics;
excellent language skills in English and one or more other languages;

If the vacancy appeals to you, but you are doubting whether you might be THE person we are looking for, please do apply. We particularly welcome applications from candidates from underrepresented backgrounds.

PhD researcher in Criminal Procedure Law and AI for intelligence analysis,"Location: AMSTERDAM

FTE: 1 - 1
Job description
Do you want to study one of the core legal and regulatory issues relating to the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for intelligence analysis in criminal investigations?

And do you want to contribute to a vision on how to regulate such AI through criminal procedure law and technology?


This PhD position on Criminal Procedure Law and AI for intelligence analysis at the Criminal Law group of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam is part of an interdisciplinary research project ‘AI4Intelligence’. You will join an exciting and vibrant community where legal scholars, computer scientists and public administration experts meet and form interdisciplinary teams that work at the intersection of Criminal Procedure Law and Technology.


Your duties

What are you going to do?
The main goal of using AI for intelligence analysis is to produce evidence that can be used in criminal cases in court. However, in order to translate AI-generated information into admissible court evidence it must comply with the general evidentiary requirements of reliability and lawfulness. There are two interrelated reasons that make satisfying these requirements difficult. First, there is a lack of (clear) rules as to how the evidentiary requirements – developed for analogue situations with different types of evidence in mind – are to be operationalised in the context of AI in the criminal process. And, second, AI diminishes the transparency and explainability of the evidence-creation process. The resulting effect reduces the possibility of the judge and the defence to question and contest AI-generated evidence (i.e., ‘contestability’). The end result is that neither the judge nor the defence can properly assess whether the content of the information is truthful and has been obtained through legal methods. The lack of contestability of AI-generated evidence therefore has a significant effect on one of the core rights and principles of the criminal process: the right to a fair trial and the accompanying principle of equality of arms.


Building on existing work on AI-regulation, due process and digital evidence, this PhD will engage with the following questions. What enables the contestability of AI-produced evidence in court? How could and should requirements of transparency and explainability (as stemming from the right to a fair criminal trial) be understood in the context of AI-generated evidence and its ‘black box’ nature? To what extent can the requirements of transparency and explainability be ‘hardcoded’ in AI-tools themselves? And can a ‘dialogue-based’ approach to explainability via symbolic-AI and interactive visualisation techniques, which allow for the inclusion of contextual knowledge, mitigate issues relating to the trouble with hardcoding complex legal rules?


The PhD is a part of an NWO-funded interdisciplinary research project (‘AI4Intelligence’), which enables close collaboration with the Department of Information and Computing Sciences and the School of Governance at Utrecht University, and the Visual Analytics group (Department of Mathematics and Computer Science) at Technical University Eindhoven. Through close collaboration with researchers in law, computer science, visual analytics and public administration, you will conduct cutting-edge interdisciplinary research into the regulation of AI for intelligence analysis. With your interdisciplinary collaborative work you will be able to translate research results into innovation and influence policymaking in the Netherlands.
Requirements
a completed master’s degree in law; knowledge of Dutch criminal law is a plus;
affinity with questions of criminal law and technology and a knowledgeable curiosity for AI;
excellent academic credentials, as demonstrated by grades and/or curriculum vitae;
a creative mind and strong critical and analytical skills;
an interest in working across legal disciplines, using different methods (e.g., interdisciplinary and empirical) and collaborations with non-legal disciplines;
an excellent command of English; knowledge of Dutch is a plus.
If the vacancy appeals to you, but you are doubting whether you are THE person we are looking for, please do apply. We welcome applications from underrepresented backgrounds.

What are we offering?
We offer a temporary full-time contract with the preferred starting date on 1 June 2023. The appointment will initially be for 1 year. After a satisfactory evaluation of the initial appointment, the contract will be extended for a total duration of 3 years.
The salary will be in accordance with university regulations for academic personnel and amounts €2,541 (PhD) per month during the first year and increases to €3,247 (PhD) per month during the fourth year, based on a full-time contract. Additionally, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam offers excellent fringe benefits and various schemes and regulations to promote a good work/life balance, such as:
a maximum of 41 days of annual leave based on full-time employment;
8% holiday allowance and 8.3% end-of-year bonus;
a wide range of sports facilities which staff may use at a modest charge;
a contribution to commuting expenses.
What else do we offer?
a stimulating academic and international environment with plenty of opportunities for cooperation with colleagues from Criminal Law, Criminology and/or other sections;
monitoring and support enabling you to grow academia;
building networks;
opportunities to translate your research into impact for society.
The Criminal Law group is a part of the Criminal Law & Criminology department at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, which brings together researchers from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds.

The Faculty of Humanities, Leiden Institute for Area Studies (LIAS) is looking for a postdoctoral researcher to focus on the influence of the Purāṇas on the literary and material cultures of Southeast Asia for the ERC Advanced Grant project “PURANA – Mythical Discourse and Religious Agency in the Puranic Ecumene” (grant number 101054849).
Project Description
The Purāṇas constitute the most voluminous and enduring genre of Sanskrit literature. While many important Purāṇas were first recorded and circulated in the first millennium CE, the genre has remained a living tradition through the colonial period until the present day. Despite the tradition’s centrality for cultural production in South Asia, we know very little about their historical embeddedness. PURANA makes a critical intervention in the field by tracing the composition, transmission, translation, and agency of the Purāṇas as a transregional and transhistorical process involving multiple actors, audiences, and geographic contexts. Adopting a longue durée perspective, we argue that the Purāṇas’ mythical discourse underlies and unites the religio-political culture of the Sanskrit Cosmopolis—establishing what we call a ‘Puranic Ecumene’: a vast part of the inhabited premodern world united by a distinctive mythical discourse, a hegemonic vision of the integration of society and cosmos, and a remarkable way of anchoring the present in the continuing ancient past.
Key Responsibilities
The postdoctoral researcher will carry out research on the reception and re-creation of Indic Puranic narratives in Southeast Asian literary and material culture. While the Old Javanese Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa appears to be a unique case of direct translation of a known Sanskrit Purāṇa into Old Javanese, court poetry (Kakawin) in general attests to the massive impact of the Purāṇas on Javanese religion and society. Reception of Puranic narratives is also attested in epigraphic sources, temple arts, and iconographic programmes. The ideal candidate would make use of the large collection of Old Javanese manuscripts and Southeast Asian archival materials in the Leiden University Library special collections and the museums of the Netherlands. In addition to doing research, the candidate will have the opportunity to teach within the LIAS.
Selection Criteria
PhD in a relevant field (South and Southeast Asian Studies, Religious Studies, Art History).
Prior experience in conducting historical research with primary literary and/or material sources.
Excellent command of English as well as command of a relevant Southeast Asian language. Reading knowledge of Sanskrit is preferred as well.
Interested in working collaboratively with a multidisciplinary team exploring primary sources and their broader socio-historical contexts.

The Faculty of Law, Institute for Information Law (IViR), and the University Research Priority Area on Trust in the Digital Society (TRUST RPA: https://www.ivir.nl/trust-in-the-digital-society-new-uva-research-priority-area/ ) is looking for a postdoctoral researcher to study the institutional safeguards of trustworthy centralized and decentralized techno-social infrastructures.

The TRUST RPA is a five year long interdisciplinary research initiative to study how we trust is changing due to the emergence of new trust production technologies, and the disruption of existing trust relations.

The digital society relies on an ever-expanding network of digital infrastructures. This forces us to rethink some of our basic assumptions about one of the most fundamental resources in all interpersonal, social, economic relations: trust.
Despite their widespread use, we know little about the trustworthiness of our digital infrastructures. At best it is difficult to establish their trustworthiness (such as with AI), at worst they are proven to be untrustworthy (as is the case with social media).
Some of these digital infrastructures play key roles in interpersonal and societal trust dynamics. They disrupt existing trust relations and offer new ways to trust each other.
Our scientific methods and theories face serious limits when it comes to the study of change of social structures, institutions, and processes under the conditions of rapid technological transformation. Research on trust in technology and trust by technology is siloed, and focuses on narrowly defined technologies (AI), or problems (system security), and lacks a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, long-term-view.

This postdoctoral position (embedded in the TRUST RPA, supervised by both the Institute for Information Law, at the Amsterdam Law School, and at least one other participating faculty) will use empirical research to study how various new technological infrastructures disrupt or can enhance existing societal (impersonal, institutional) trust relations and strive to establish new forms of trust relations in society.

What are you going to do?

 The successful candidate will:
Conduct empirical, qualitative research (interviews, case studies, discourse analysis) on the dynamics of institutional, impersonal trust with regards to emerging digital technologies, such as digital platforms, web3 technologies, or Machine Learning based automated systems.
Coordinate the development, fieldwork and initial analysis of a large-scale longitudinal survey
Conduct work on the emerging European technology regulation framework (Digital Services Act, AI Act, Digital Markets Act) using doctrinal research, normative research and discourse analysis
Organize events, conferences
Participate in grant proposal development, international network building
Acquiree funding

The Postdoctoral researcher will be hired by the Faculty of Law, closely collaborating with two other postdoctoral researchers in the Trust RPA. The team will be supervised by the PIs of the TRUS RPA: Balazs Bodo, Associate Professor at the Institute of Information Law (IViR) at the Faculty of Law, Jan B. Engelmann, Professor of Neuroeconomics at the Amsterdam School of Economics, Theo Araujo, Associate Professor Communication in the Digital Society at the Amsterdam School of Communication Research (ASCoR), Tom van Engers, Professor in Legal Knowledge Management at the University of Amsterdam, and Marc Tuters, Assistant Professor in the New Media and Digital Culture Division of Media Studies at the Faculty of Humanities.

What do we require of you?

 The successful candidate has:
a PhD degree in law, or social sciences (sociology, economics, political science, communication science, science and technology studies or related fields)
strong empirical research skills;
familiarity with qualitative research methods,
familiarity with doctrinal research or policy research;
good knowledge of current developments in information markets and technology;
academic excellence, as shown in the grade transcripts and curriculum vitae.
a creative mind and analytical intelligence;
an interest in working in a multidisciplinary team;
willingness to learn new knowledge, and acquire new skills required by the project;
excellent written and spoken command of English, and ideally knowledge of Dutch
interest in working on interdisciplinary topics, in interdisciplinary teams.

Candidates, who have:
quantitative skills, including survey development, statistical analysis, and/or
familiarity with R, python or any other programming language, and/or
big data collection and analysis skills, and/or
previous experience in the private or public sector

will be given extra consideration in the application process.

We strongly encourage members of broadly understood minority socio-cultural groups to apply. We believe that there are several traditionally underrepresented, but incredibly forceful perspectives, that have transformed our respective disciplines. Recent scholarship by persons of colour, feminist, intersectionalist scholars, scholars from the Global South have highlighted fundamental issues with the design, operation, and impact of techno-social systems that remained in the blind spots of mainstream scholarship. Without such contributions, serious problems, such as racial bias in AI systems, would have gone unnoticed and left unaddressed by more careful technical design and better regulation.

Our offer

We offer a temporary employment contract for 38 hours per week for a period of 36 months with a probationary period of two months. The preferred starting date is as soon possible.
The gross monthly salary, based on 30,4 -38 (0.8-1 FTE) hours per week and dependent on relevant experience, ranges between € 2,960 to € 4,670 (scale 10). UvA additionally offers an extensive package of secondary benefits, including 8% holiday allowance and a year-end bonus of 8.3%. The UFO profile Researcher 4 is applicable. A favourable tax agreement, the ‘30% ruling’, may apply to non-Dutch applicants. The Collective Labour Agreement of Universities of the Netherlands is applicable.

Besides the salary and a vibrant and challenging environment we offer you multiple fringe benefits:
232 holiday hours per year (based on fulltime) and extra holidays between Christmas and 1 January;
Multiple courses to follow from our Teaching and Learning Centre;
Multiple courses on topics such as leadership for academic staff;
Multiple courses on topics such as time management, handling stress and an online learning platform with 100+ different courses;
7 weeks birth leave (partner leave) with 100% salary;
Partly paid parental leave;
The possibility to set up a workplace at home;
A pension at ABP for which UvA pays two third part of the contribution;
The possibility to follow courses to learn Dutch;

What else do we offer
the possibility to start up and grow a New Research priority Area at the UvA,
close working relations with five faculties of the UvA; and with TU Delft, and Erasmus University, Rotterdam
freedom to develop your own research agenda;
welcoming, international, dynamic teams;
an inspiring academic and professional environment in the heart of Amsterdam;
excellent possibilities for further professional development and education.

Are you looking for a challenging job in a dynamic setting? The Leadership & Management section at the Amsterdam Business School (ABS), University of Amsterdam, invites applications for a tenure-track faculty assistant professor position with emphasis on “The digital citizen as a worker” to join our section.

Work is a core human activity that affects income as well as identity. Yet, jobs, workplaces and employment relationships are all fundamentally changing due to the ongoing digital transformation, the increased role of algorithms in organizations and the rise of the platform economy. This yields many new questions that are important to address. For example, how do new forms of employment (e.g., gig work, or self-employment) or work (e.g., remote work) as a result of digitization change the employment relationship and what consequences do such changes have for workers? What are the benefits and the risks of the growing importance of algorithmic management for the worker as well as the organization? What is the impact of digitalization on the meaning of work and citizens identity? Also, there is currently a growing risk that the increasing differences in the level of digital literacy will lead to an increasing gap in employability and income potential between those who are able to keep up with technological developments and those who struggle to do so. How do such differences in digital literacy impact workers and organizations, and how can digital literacy of workers be developed in more inclusive ways? These are interdisciplinary themes that fit both with our section and especially the Amsterdam People Analytics Centre and is part of the interdisciplinary theme: 'Education, citizenship and democracy in a digital world' of the Faculty of Economics and Business, the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences, the Faculty of Humanities, and the Faculty of Law. 'Education, citizenship and democracy in a digital world' is one of the interdisciplinary themes in the Dutch Sectorplan SSH.

Want to become part of a dynamic community that is at the forefront of AI-driven Fintech innovation? Our experts from the Faculty of Science (with the Informatics Institute, the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation and the Korteweg de Vries Institute), the Faculty of Economics & Business (Amsterdam Business School and Amsterdam School of Economics) and the Faculty of Law (Institute for Information Law, Amsterdam Center for Law & Economics), are collaborating with leading Fintech companies and (regulating) organizations to develop cutting-edge AI solutions to solve complex problems in financial technology. Are you ready to be part of this exciting ecosystem and take your career to the next level? If so, we would like to invite you to apply for one of our seven PhD positions described below.

Project 1: Knowledge-Driven Learning for XAI in Fraud Detection In this project we aim to develop a novel neuro-symbolic framework that mainly combines the strengths of both the data-driven approaches (which comes with adaptability, autonomy, and good qualitative performance) and the knowledge-driven approaches (which comes with interpretability, maintainability, and well-understood computational characteristics) to provide explanations for experts in terms of relevant features and the structures in-between.
Supervisors: Erman Acar (IvI/ILLC), Ilker Birbil (ABS)

Project 2: AIDA: Artificial Intelligence for Due-diligence Analysis In this project, we aim to develop information retrieval and natural language processing technology for e-discovery and due diligence analysis on legal and financial textual documents, and to support legal professionals searching for very specific information in huge sets of disclosed documents.
Supervisors: Marc Francke (ABS), Jaap Kamps (ILLC)
External partners: Imprima, Zuva AI

Project 3: Learning High Dimensional Contagion Processes in Finance and Insurance Multivariate contagion processes, e.g., those of the Hawkes type, have found widespread applications in finance and insurance, most noticeably for the modeling of systemic risk build-up. Whereas much progress has been made in exploring the underlying probabilistic properties, aspects of learning are still in their infancy. This project focuses on statistical learning for multivariate contagion processes, with a special focus on the practically highly relevant setting of many interacting components and high-dimensional processes.
Supervisors: Roger Laeven (ASE), Michel Mandjes (KdVI)
External partner: Association of Insurers

Project 4: Robust fraud detection through causality-inspired ML Payment platforms like Adyen use technology to efficiently detect fraud. Fraud detection is challenging, since both the genuine and fraudulent customer behavior changes over time and across markets. Machine learning is crucial for this task, but current methods are susceptible to learning spurious correlations. The goal of this project is to leverage causality-inspired machine learning methods to improve the robustness of fraud detection methods to distribution shifts.
Supervisors: Sara Magliacane (IvI), Ana Mickovic (ABS)
External partner: Adyen

Project 5: Systems for AI Data Quality in Finance The impact of data errors on the output of AI models is difficult to anticipate and measure, and these errors can negatively impact regulatory compliance. Therefore, this project aims to enable non-technical users to validate and increase the quality of their data. For that, these users should be able to express data quality rules in natural language. We will design a data driven approach to leverage such rules to assist a domain expert to finetune data quality rules and “stress test” downstream AI models. This project favors a strong data engineering background combined with an interest to engage with European regulation applicable to financial data.
Supervisors: Sebastian Schelter (IvI), Kristina Irion (IViR)
External partner: ABN-AMRO

Project 6: Environment, Social and Governance (ESG) regulation impact on financial stability In this project, we will analyze the driving factors behind ESG ratings via ML and XAI which will lead to a clearer understanding of how companies will be affected by ESG regulation. The insights gained from this analysis will allow us to study the effects on financial stability in a simulation study using agent-based models under realistic settings derived from empirical analysis.
Supervisors: Simon Trimborn (ASE), Debraj Roy (IvI)
External partner: ING

Project 7: HyperMining: Explainable Anti-Money Laundering using Process Mining on Hypergraphs In this project we aim to develop an innovative Anti-Money Laundering methodology using advanced AI methods using hypergraph representations and process mining which can give an integral view of the transactions involved, deal with the inherent complexity of the data, and still be understandable for the experts analyzing the data so they can substantiate their decisions.
Supervisors: Marcel Worring (IvI), Michael Werner (ABS)

PhD (Quantum) Data Governance and the Law of Sensing and Measurement,"PhD (Quantum) Data Governance and the Law of Sensing and Measurement
Faculteit/Dienst: Faculteit der Rechtsgeleerdheid
Opleidingsniveau: Master
Functie type: Promotieplaats
Sluitingsdatum: 24.04.2023
Vacaturenummer: 11243
Do you want to contribute to a vision on how to address new sensing capabilities of 21st century digital infrastructures in data governance law? And do you want to study one of the core legal and governance questions with respect to quantum technologies?

This PhD position on (Quantum) Data Governance and the Law of Sensing and Measurement is part of the new research group on the law and governance of quantum technologies at the Institute for Information Law, University of Amsterdam. The Institute for Information Law is one of the largest research facilities in information law world-wide. The Institute brings together more than 40 researchers from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds. The research group is a part of Action line 4 on the Ethical, Legal And Societal Aspects of Quantum Technologies of the Quantum Delta NL ecosystem.

What are you going to do

Over the last years, public and private investment in quantum technologies, including quantum computing, communications and sensing, have received a significant boost. Quantum computing has been the most eye catching in the quantum tech innovation landscape. It promises, when fully realized, to add additional special-purpose computational capacity to our current-day digital infrastructure. The advancement of quantum sensing technologies has proceeded with less fanfare, despite more advanced technology-readiness and wide possible application areas. Quantum sensing technologies promise to enhance digital infrastructures in ways that may have significant societal implications.

Measurement and sensing, including the establishment of standards and the collection of digital data in socio-technical settings, is a core function of current-day digital infrastructures. Through sensing, digital infrastructure facilitates processes of capture. This can be capture of operations, of behavior, and of environments, each creating new possibilities for control and governance in the process. Innovations in quantum sensing technologies may reconfigure such possibilities of capture in new ways.

Taking the increasing entanglement of law and digital infrastructure as a starting point, this PhD project will engage with the following questions. What are some of the unique legal challenges that quantum sensing applications may create in light of current information law, fundamental rights (including the right to private life and data protection)? Do some of the unique properties of quantum information (such as the possibility of entanglement and no cloning) and particular quantum sensing and metrology applications call into question the relation of law to information and data, as it has developed over the last decades? How can law support the beneficial and responsible use of quantum sensing applications while addressing such legal challenges? What challenges do disruptive sensing technologies pose for the law-infrastructure relationship? And finally, how should law respond to the dual-use nature of certain quantum sensing applications and contribute to the proper balance between the different societal interests implicated by quantum sensing technologies?

The PhD project will be part of the research group on the Law and Governance of Quantum Technologies at the Institute for Information Law (IViR) at the Faculty of Law of the University of Amsterdam. You will conduct original cutting-edge research into the law and governance of quantum technologies, quantum sensing technologies in particular. You will develop new insights into the specific legal implications of particular quantum sensing applications. And using legal theory, information law and other relevant disciplines, and while engaging with relevant stakeholders, you will contribute to our understanding of the relation between law and digital infrastructures today and in the quantum age.

What do we require

a completed degree in law, or equivalent degree;
affinity with questions of data governance and a knowledgeable curiosity for developments in quantum technologies;
good knowledge of current regulatory developments with respect to digital infrastructure and cloud computing;
excellent academic credentials, as demonstrated by grades and/or curriculum vitae;
a creative mind and strong critical and analytical skills;
an interest in working across legal disciplines, using different methods (including empirical, theoretical and interdisciplinary), and collaborations with other relevant non-legal disciplines;
strong communication skills and a commitment to contributing to diverse and inclusive team dynamics;
excellent language skills in English and one or more other languages;

If the vacancy appeals to you, but you are doubting whether you might be THE person we are looking for, please do apply. We particularly welcome applications from candidates from underrepresented backgrounds.

Our offer

We offer a temporary full-time contract for the period of 4 years (with a go no go review assessment after the first year). The preferred starting date is 1 September 2023, with a possibility to start earlier.

The salary, depending on relevant experience before the beginning of the employment contract, will be € 2,541 to € 3,247 (scale P) gross per month, based on a fulltime contract (38 hours a week). This is exclusive 8% holiday allowance and 8.3% end-of-year bonus. A favourable tax agreement, the ‘30% ruling’, may apply to non-Dutch applicants. The Collective Labour Agreement of Dutch Universities is applicable.

The UvA offers excellent possibilities for further professional development and education.

What else do we offer
Be part of a diverse team of engaged and enthusiastic researchers from a diversity of disciplines (law, computer science, communication science, ethics, economics, political science, humanities) and countries;
Mentoring and support in developing your future academic career;
Ample opportunities to translate your research into impact for society.

PhD Public acceptability of deep underground activities,"The University of Groningen is a research university with a global outlook, deeply rooted in Groningen, City of Talent. Quality has had top priority for four hundred years, and with success: the University is currently in or around the top 100 on several influential ranking lists.

The Faculty of Behavioural and Social Sciences excels in teaching and research in the fields of human behaviour, thinking, learning, and how people live together. We work on societal issues and problems that people experience in daily life. Central to this is individual and societal resilience and how to increase this. To this end, we focus on the topics of migration, the environment and climate, health, upbringing and education, the protection of vulnerable minorities, and sustainable partnerships. The Faculty of Behavioural and Social Sciences employs over 800 staff members. For more information about the Faculty please check the link https://www.rug.nl/gmw/.

This PhD position is offered by the Environmental Psychology group at the University of Groningen together with the Economic Affairs Advisory group at the Netherlands Organization for applied scientific research (TNO). The project aims to investigate public perceptions and acceptability of deep underground activities, such as gas extractions, geothermal energy production, carbon capture and storage, and hydrogen storage.
Environmental Psychology at the University of Groningen has a national and international reputation for excellence. Research within the Environmental Psychology group focuses on a wide range of topics, including understanding which factors affect sustainable behaviours (such as energy use, car use, food consumption, and participation in environmental groups); understanding how people and groups cope with environmental and climate risks; understanding the effectiveness of strategies to promote sustainable behaviour; understanding the acceptability environmental policies and changes; and the effects of sustainable behaviour on wellbeing. The research aims to contribute to theory development and practice, and is embedded in the research programme Interpersonal Behaviour, as well as in two of the focus areas of the University of Groningen: Energy and Sustainable Society. The Environmental Psychology group collaborates with scholars from different disciplines within and outside the University of Groningen, as well as with governments, NGOs, and various business organisations.

TNO was founded by law in 1932 to enable business and government to apply knowledge. As an organization regulated by public law, we are independent to speed up the transition of academic knowledge to applications. The Geological Survey of the Netherlands (GDN: Geologische Dienst Nederland) is part of TNO and has been studying the subsurface for over a century.
The Advisory Group of Economic Affairs, as part of both TNO and GDN, is a geoscientifically educated group familiar with the structure, composition and use of the deep (> 500m) subsurface of the Netherlands. Founded as the in-house advisor to the Ministry of Economic Affairs & Climate, the group focuses primarily on this domain in order to help implement the Mining Law and the Energy transition related to the subsurface. This concerns the exploration, production and storage of minerals (oil, gas and mineral salt) and geothermal heat as well as subsurface storage options such as CO2 and H2.

Project

Combating climate change, promoting a sustainable energy transition, and securing the provision of natural resources are grand societal challenges. Public resistance can lead to delays or cancelations of respective projects. This especially applies to projects related to deep underground activities, as people often associate such projects with various risks, which can fuel public resistance. Besides perceived risks, other factors can influence people’s perceptions and acceptability of these projects, such as trust in responsible parties and the extent to which people consider the decision-making process to be fair and transparent. This PhD project aims to develop and test theories to understand which factors influence public perceptions and acceptability of deep underground activities. Second, it aims to incorporate the generated knowledge and findings into practical guidelines for public communication, risk management, and decision making in the field of deep underground activities.
You will develop theory, generate hypotheses, and conduct empirical studies (e.g., studies with representative samples, longitudinal studies, experiments in the lab and in the field) into public perceptions and acceptability of deep underground activities. You will publish the results of your studies in international scientific journals, which will be part of your PhD thesis, and you will present your studies at international scientific conferences, as well as to professionals working in the field of deep underground activities (by means of professional presentations, trainings, research reports, and policy briefs). You will be a member of the Environmental Psychology Group, and your research will be embedded in the Research Programme Interpersonal Behaviour and in the Dutch Kurt Lewin Institute. You will also be a member of the Economic Affairs Advisory Group at TNO.

The tasks of the PhD candidate are:
conduct research that results in a dissertation and is in line with the objectives and requirements of the project;organize and execute the data collection for the different studies;publish the results of the research in international scientific journals;present the research findings to fellow scientists, as well as professionals in the field working with underground activities, and collaborate with them;provide a limited number of educational activities at the Psychology department, such as small-scale tutorials and guest lectures, in collaboration with the supervisors;collaborate with the research teams from the University of Groningen and TNO in successfully implementing the research project.

Qualifications

We are looking for a PhD student who is highly motivated to work on this topic, and is particularly interested in conducting theory-based research with a high societal relevance. You have completed a Master in Psychology with a focus on Environmental or Social Psychology, or a scientific education which is closely related to this, or you expect to receive such a Master degree soon. You have a creative, critical and independent research attitude and you are open to different perspectives and feedback on your research. You can work independently, but can also collaborate with other, including researchers as well as professionals working in the field of deep underground activities. You have good communication skills in English and Dutch, both verbally and written (or willingness to learn Dutch).

PhD on decision-making chain in the hydrogen economy,"The “Hydrogen Works” program aims at realizing a continuous learning line in the Northern Netherland in the field of hydrogen. With education, training and courses at MBO, HBO, WO and post-initial (advanced professional) level. The educational institutions involved in the region are working together on a coordinated approach. This is the only way to develop continuous learning lines and to achieve synergy between the various levels of education.

This learning line include the training of ONE PhD Student in the hydrogen field at the crossroad between law and psychology.

We are seeking a PhD candidate that researches the synergies and mismatches between how law shapes the development of decision-making, from policy to plans to permits (so-called decision-making chain) and how people want to interact with such decision-making processes. Policy makers in the European Union are pressing for developing an hydrogen economy. However, climate change mitigation policies can still encounter societal opposition. Citizens might however oppose such a development, especially if they feel excluded from decision-making and overruled by vested interests. If organised well, participatory practices can potentially positively influence acceptability and perceived fairness of the hydrogen economy.

A key shortcoming, however, on public participation remains the mismatch between how participatory procedures are designed by legislation in the decision-making chain and people’s actual preferences for public participation and their behaviours during such procedures. In particular, people feel frustrated when during a participatory procedure for a permit, responsible parties relay on what has been decided at the level of (national) policy or plans to refuse discussing public proposals.

In this project, we aim at focusing on this specific issue by assessing the room for deviating from what has been decided at higher levels of the decision-making chain during participatory procedures concerning lower levels of the chain. Moreover, we focus on what effects any changes might have on public opinion from the perspective of perceived procedural fairness and legitimacy of the decision-making and the perspective of acceptability of the adopted decision.

Postdoctoral Position Foreign Fighters in Ukraine,"Postdoctoral Position Foreign Fighters in Ukraine
Faculteit/Dienst: Faculteit der Geesteswetenschappen
Opleidingsniveau: Gepromoveerd
Functie type: Wetenschappelijk Personeel
Sluitingsdatum: 24 April 2023
Vacaturenummer: 11387
The Amsterdam School of Historical Studies (ASH) currently has a vacant Postdoc researcher position as part of the Dutch National Research Agenda (Nationale Wetenschapsagenda, NWA)-funded project Foreign Fighters in Ukraine: Mobilisations, Combat experiences, and Return trajectories, led by main researchers Dr Samuël Kruizinga (UvA) and Dr Elanie Rodermond (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam/NSCR). ASH is one of the five Research Schools within the Amsterdam Institute for Humanities Research.
What are you going to do?

Since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, thousands of volunteer ""foreign fighters"" – including an unknown number of Dutchmen – have joined Ukraine’s International Legion. The research project Foreign Fighters in Ukraine: Mobilisations, Combat experiences, and Return trajectories’ central aim is to study both foreign fighting generally and increase our understanding of the International Legion specifically. Specifically, it aims to ascertain how the unique Ukrainian battlespace and the (social) media landscape shape mobilisations, combat experiences, and return trajectories of this iteration of the foreign fighter phenomenon.
You will, on the basis of currently available, but disparate historical data sets on foreign fighters in the 19th and 20th century, as well as contemporary information on returning Islamic State volunteers, set up hypotheses related to this project’s central aim. Then you will test these by making creative use of contemporary open sources on foreign fighter involvement in the Russo-Ukrainian war, including social media posts. Crucially, you will contact and then interview actual, potential and/or returning Dutch members of the International Legion.
Your research will be indispensable in increasing policy makers’ as well as mental health and legal experts’ ability to understand the ramifications of foreign fighting on both systemic and personal levels. Societal stakeholders in the overall project are ARQ Nationaal Psychotrauma Centrum, the Dutch national centre for specialist diagnostics and treatment of people with complex psychotraumatic complaints, ARQ Kenniscentrum Oorlog, Vervolging en Geweld, the prime Dutch knowledge centre for research on the psychosocial impact of war on individuals and society, the T.M.C. Asser Institute, which specialises in international (humanitarian) law and operates at the interface of academia, legal practice and governance, and the Nederlands Veteraneninstituut, which promotes the social recognition of combat veterans, and has expertise in and developed a working methodology for sensitive, post-mission interviews with combat veterans. Together with these stakeholders and project leaders Kruizinga and Rodermond you will contribute to a workshop to be organized by all subproject partners to bring together historical, legal, psychological, psychiatric, political and social science, experiential and government perspectives on foreign fighting in Ukraine and beyond; to a joint policy brief resulting from the workshop designed to disseminate public knowledge and influence policy; and to a podcast on foreign fighting.

Your tasks and responsibilities:
participating in meetings with the project leads and partners;
conducting research, presenting intermediate research results at workshops and conferences and publishing a single-authored, peer reviewed article;
co-organising knowledge dissemination activities (workshop, policy brief, podcast).

What do you have to offer?

We are looking for a team player with a research interest in the lived experiences of volunteers, who enjoys the challenges of new research areas and formats, relishes working within an interdisciplinary team, and is interested in communicating results to both various scientific communities and to a wider public.

Your experience and profile:
a PhD in history, criminology, anthropology, law, or related fields;
a strong cooperative attitude and willingness to engage in collaborative research;
experience with semi-structured interviews in research settings;
near-native command of Dutch (required for the interviews) and English.
research interests related to foreign fighting, either in the past or the present;
excellent qualitative research skills demonstrated by a track record of publishing in high-ranking journals and/or with leading presses or a demonstrable capacity to develop such a record;
enthusiasm for communicating academic research to non-academic audiences.

What can we offer you?

The Postdoc researcher will be appointed at the Department of History, European Studies and Religious Studies of the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Amsterdam and will conduct the research in Amsterdam School of Historical Studies (ASH). The employment contract is for one year and 26.6 hours a week (= 0.7 fte). Preferred starting date is either 01 June 2023 or 1 September 2023 depending on the availability of the selected candidate.
The gross monthly salary, based on 38 hours per week and relevant experience, ranges between € 3.703 to € 5.439. This sum does not include the 8% holiday allowance and the 8,3% year-end allowance. A favourable tax agreement, the ‘30% ruling’, may apply to non-Dutch applicants. The Collective Labour Agreement of Dutch Universities is applicable.

What else do we offer?
excellent possibilities for further professional development and education;
an enthusiastic, inspiring and professional academic team;
the opportunity to collaborate with leading researchers at research institutes that - partly as a result of their interdisciplinary approach - are world renowned.
