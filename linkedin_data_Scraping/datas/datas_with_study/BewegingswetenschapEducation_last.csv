Faculteit/Dienst: Faculteit der Rechtsgeleerdheid
Opleidingsniveau: Gepromoveerd
Functie type: Wetenschappelijk Personeel
Sluitingsdatum: 12 May 2023
Vacaturenummer: 11408
The Asser Institute, based in The Hague, and affiliated with the University of Amsterdam is seeking an enthusiastic POST-DOCTORAL RESEARCHER IN INTERNATIONAL LAW AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE on a full-time basis (38 hours per week/1 FTE). They will join the research strand on Disruptive technologies in peace and security within our Research Agenda Rethinking public interests in international and European law, and take part in the NWO-funded research project ELSA Lab Defence.

Disruptive technologies in peace and security
The research strand on Disruptive technologies in peace and security conducts research on technologies that have disruptive implications for international security and international law, including military applications of artificial intelligence (AI), data-driven warfare, biochemical weapons, and conventional weapons or dual use technologies with a disruptive potential. Our research focuses, in particular, on the development of the international regulatory framework for the military and security applications of disruptive technologies. Two main lines of enquiry guide research within this strand: on the one hand, we question how legal norms and ethical values can shape technologies, and on the other hand we analyse how technologies challenge our legal norms and ethical values.

Current research projects in the strand include the DILEMA project (Designing International Law and Ethics into Military Artificial Intelligence), the I2RAMP project (Implementing International Responsibility for AI in Military Practice), and initiatives in the field of international arms control law.

ELSA Lab Defence
The ELSA Lab Defence is a research project addressing Ethical, Legal and Societal Aspects (ELSA) of AI in the defence sector. The project aims to develop an assessment and design methodology that helps translating ELSA into (socio-)technical requirements, and establishes a practical and pragmatic research, development and deployment process for AI-based applications. The interdisciplinary project consortium is led by TNO and includes, next to the Asser Institute, the Delft University of Technology, Leiden University, the Nederlandse Defensie Academie (NLDA), and the Hague University of Applied Sciences. The ELSA Lab is funded by NWO under the synergy theme Human-centric AI for an inclusive society: Towards an ecosystem of trust.

What are you going to do?

The post-doctoral researcher will notably conduct research to identify specific use-cases and contextual factors, and conceptualise their implications for the ELSA Lab methodology. Relevant factors may include different types of applications of AI in a military context, human-machine teams on the battlefield versus in the decision room, ELSA in multinational operations, domain specific ELSA (e.g. maritime, space, cyber), and AI in interaction with other technologies. This will serve as a ground to refine general approaches on legal aspects of AI in defence, to develop representative case studies and an ELSA-impact assessment methodology, as well as to define relevant parameters for exercises, simulations, and trainings on decision-making and human-machine interaction in practice. The post-doctoral researcher will work in collaboration with other researchers of the ELSA Lab project, and incorporate insights from interdisciplinary perspectives on AI in defence.

Professor of Architectural and Urban History,"Professor of Architectural and Urban History
Faculteit/Dienst: Faculteit der Geesteswetenschappen
Opleidingsniveau: Gepromoveerd
Functie type: Wetenschappelijk Personeel
Sluitingsdatum: 26 April 2023
Vacaturenummer: 11325
The Faculty of Humanities employs just under 1,000 employees, and approximately 8,000 students study there. The faculty consists of eight departments: Philosophy, Dutch Studies, Media Studies, Art and Cultural Studies, History, European Studies and Religious Studies, Amsterdam Centre for Ancient Studies and Archaeology, Modern Foreign Languages and Cultures, and Literature and Linguistics. Each department is composed of capacity groups, which consist of one or more professors and a number of employees who work in the relevant field.

The Department of Art and Cultural Studies has a vacancy for a full professorship in:

Architectural and Urban History 1,0 FTE (permanent position)

What will you do?

Context of the chair
The Professor of Architectural and Urban History is affiliated with the Amsterdam School of Historical Studies (ASH) and the Arts and Culture department (more specifically the Art History chair group). The basis for the chair is the historical approach of architecture from an art history perspective: this is of fundamental importance in order to ensure the necessary broad Humanities outlook for interdisciplinary research and teaching within and outside the UvA. In addition, the perspective will be broadened to include urban history, with special attention in the research dedicated to the experience of the urban environment; a more international interpretation that does not yet exist in the Netherlands. The new colleague to be appointed will therefore have architectural history experience with an added focus on contemporary urban history and urban design history, as well as the interplay between the built and natural environment, in which environmental history experience (the role of the historical city in its natural environment) is extremely desirable. The focus in this regard will be on a historical perspective that can be linked to modern-day problems of the urban and architectural living environment. This means that expertise in various approaches to the built environment, for example based on experience of the living environment (perception of the environment) will be expected.
The professor will be responsible, in particular, for teaching in the Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Art History, as well as in the Bachelor in Global Arts, Culture and Politics. The professor will play a significant role in both the teaching for the Master’s track Stadsgeschiedenis (Urban History) within the department of History, European Studies and Religious Studies and for various other degree programmes. In addition, the new professor is expected to undertake administrative tasks.

The chair will provide a strong starting point for the aforementioned collaborations within the University, but also with researchers and external institutions, such as Arcam, Het Nieuwe Instituut, the Cultural Heritage Agency, urban authorities and NGOs. The professor is expected to play a leading role in these types of collaborations.

Teaching
The professor will first be responsible for the Architectural History components within the Art History capacity group (capaciteitsgroep Kunstgeschiedenis). Architectural History is one of the four chair groups within the Art History capacity group, in addition to Medieval Art History (Middeleeuwse kunstgeschiedenis), Art History of the Early Modern Period (Kunstgeschiedenis van de nieuwere tijd), and Modern and Contemporary Art History (Moderne en hedendaagse kunstgeschiedenis). Approximately a quarter of the compulsory curriculum of the BA is therefore provided by the Architectural History chair group. In addition to these components, Architectural History also provides three successful BA specialisations, which can also be taken as electives (see also Minor): Ontwerpen voor de moderne stad (Designing for the Modern City); Dit is Amsterdam: identiteit en beeldvorming in kunst en architectuur (This is Amsterdam: identity and perception in art and architecture) and Reparatie en imitatie. Over het gebouwde erfgoed in het ‘eigentijdse’ Amsterdam. Over het gebouwde erfgoed in het 'eigentijdse' Amsterdam. (Repair and imitation. About the built heritage in ‘contemporary Amsterdam).

Secondly, the professor will make an important contribution to the minor Architectuur en Stedenbouw (minor in Architecture and Urban Planning). This is taken annually by approx. 20 students (mostly Human Geography, Urban and Regional Planning, and Geography students, in addition to students from other studies, including English, Economics, Communication Science, Philosophy, Sociology and Anthropology). The minor also provides a basis for the interdisciplinary Master’s track Stadsgeschiedenis (Urban History, department of History, European Studies and Religious Studies: approx. 5 minor students move on to this track annually. Finally, the professor will play an important role in the BA programme Global Arts, Culture and Politics, particularly the major in Sustainability).

Research
The professor will conduct research within the research school Amsterdam School of Historical Studies (ASH). It is important for the research school that the professor’s research ties in with the new methodological and theoretical developments within architectural history that also considers, in addition to the built environment, the urban perception of the environment from a social perspective and sensory experience. An additional expertise in the interplay between the built and natural environment is desirable. The new professor will take a central position within the Centre for Urban History within ASH. This centre has developed into an important pillar within ASH for interdisciplinary research into the history of the city from antiquity to the present day, with approximately 35 staff members from various disciplines. The professor is expected to assume a connecting and guiding role within this centre. In addition, the professor will be responsible for setting up broad interdisciplinary collaborations with researchers within the Faculty of Humanities (FGw) and the University of Amsterdam (UvA), for example with Urban Studies within the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences (FMG), leading to individual or group applications for research financing (ERC, NWO, NWA, etc.). In addition, an international orientation (with corresponding network) is desirable in order to guarantee the leading role of the chair in Amsterdam within a field that is increasingly globally oriented.
The newly appointed professor is further expected to have knowledge of contemporary, innovative and digital research methods, which provide insight into issues about the digital built environment, the digital city (also an important theme within the MA track Urban History) and the living environment, and to collaborate with researchers in Creative Amsterdam: An E-Humanities perspective, and the 4D-Research Lab.

It is expected that the professor to be appointed will be able to enthuse and mentor young researchers; that the professor will have experience in PhD supervision and be able to contribute to creating a safe and stimulating environment for PhD candidates. The professor will also bear responsibility for actively recruiting PhD candidates by means of submitting grant applications in the Netherlands and abroad.

Leadership
The professor to be appointed will preside over the Architectural History chair group with five staff members, which will include two lecturers, a professor by special appointment and two assistant professors, and will have to perform administrative duties at the level of the educational administration (programme director BA of MA), research organisation (e.g. research director of ASH or the national research school for art history) and/or at departmental level (capacity group chair Art History, departmental chair Arts and Culture). Expansion of the administrative capacity is needed within these various levels. Given the desire to create an environment for employees and students that is safe and inclusive, it is of vital importance that the professor to be appointed possesses organisational sensitivity and exercises leadership that is appropriate in this regard.

Your tasks and responsibilities:
teaching Architectural and Urban History, including supervising Bachelor’s and Master’s theses;
contributing to innovation and improvement of the curriculum in the field of Architectural and Urban History;
addressing research themes and projects within the chair group and research groups;
actively pursuing external funding for research, notably funding from research councils, on national as well as European level;
carrying out HR responsibilities within the Architectural History chair group;
carrying out administrative and management tasks within the Department and Faculty.

What expertise do we require of you?

Successful candidates for the position are expected to meet the following requirements.
You:
hold a PhD in Architectural History or a related academic field;
have an excellent international academic reputation and publication profile, which match the research themes of ASH;
have an affinity with inclusive, polyphonous historical scholarship and digital methods;
are an experienced and engaged teacher at all levels of academic training;
have expertise in developing and renewing teaching programmes at Bachelor’s and Master’s levels;
can show a track record of applying for/acquiring external research funding;
have experience with attracting and supervising PhD projects and junior researchers;
have proven management and leadership qualities and are a dedicated administrator;
have a broad national and international network with academic and cultural institutions;

EngD on Games4Care: Evaluating gamified lifestyle changing strategies,"Job description
The project Games4Care
This project is funded by Hartstichting under the subsidy open PPP program. It is part of the Care-On project aiming at creating a technology platform for remote rehabilitation aims at developing an innovative structured lifestyle intervention consisting of a holistic gamified lifestyle modification app (Greenhabit), which will be integrated with a continuous lifestyle monitoring system (Care-On, digital platform and dashboard for monitoring lifestyle and behavioral change) that will serve to create awareness and to provide accurate and objective feedback. A short summary of this project can be found below. Research input to this project has been conducted by a PhD student from Care-On project in which the Care-On lifestyle monitoring platform was developed and undergoing a clinical study at the moment, The purpose of this
Lifestyle behavior is an important determinant of the clinical course and overall treatment results of chronic cardiac diseases such as coronary artery disease (CAD) and atrial fibrillation (AF). Despite evidence and guideline recommendations, cardiac rehabilitation (CR)/structured lifestyle interventions are not well implemented in routine care for these diagnose groups due to patient-related factors (i.e. transportation problems, working obligations), low referral rates by health care professionals and limited facilities and resources. . Also, the current CR model that typically consists of group sessions in the hospital with a strong emphasis on exercise training, may not be appealing for certain subgroups (e.g. women, elderly patients, patients with lower educational levels, lower digital literacy and lower exercise capacity).Therefore, there is a strong need for appealing personalized lifestyle interventions for these patients that can be easily implemented without a large burden for the health care system. Therefore, we propose an innovative structured lifestyle intervention, consisting of a holistic gamified lifestyle modification app (Greenhabit) integrated with a continuous lifestyle monitoring system (Care-On), which will serve to create awareness and to provide accurate and objective feedback. Care-On is a digital platform and dashboard recently developed for monitoring lifestyle and behavioral change for patients with stable CAD or AF that underwent a major elective intervention (elective percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PCI) or radio frequent catheter ablation (RFCA)))
Tasks of the EngD project:
Definition and scoping of requirements and use-cases for the intervention
Creating experienceable prototypes to allow iterative development of the integration of the components and functions of Greenhabit and Mibida based on the earlier define requirements and use cases
Contributing to the implementation and evaluation of the intervention in the current care pathway.

We are looking for candidates with:
An interest and skills in developing user interface software for the defined use cases
An interest and skills in programming
An interest in designing with data and open-source software
The ability to easily communicate with experts across scientific fields and in different sectors
The capacity to function well as a team

In the same article, our university is ranked as a top institution in innovation. Here we build a brighter tomorrow for us all.
The TU/e currently has nine departments, with over 13,000 students in total. Our executive board governs and leads the university, while our departmental boards are in charge of the departments. The board of a department consist of a departmental dean, the vice-dean and the managing director. Program directors and a student member advises the departmental board. The departmental board is responsible for the operational and policy matters relating to the budget and staff policy. We are currently looking for a vice-dean at the department of Mathematics and Computer Science.
The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science
With over 110 (assistant, associate and full) professors, almost 300 PhD and EngD students, about 1500 Bachelor students and 1000 Master students, the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science (M&CS) is the largest department of the TU/e. The Department of Mathematics and Computer Science (M&CS) at TU/e is an ambitious and inclusive department, with nearly 50% of our employees being international. M&CS has defined three domains covering all research and education activities: Mathematics, Computer Science and Data Science (including AI).
We aim to contribute to science and innovation in and beyond the region by performing top-level fundamental and applied research, offering high-quality educational programs, and maintaining strong ties with society and industry. A significant amount of research is done in close collaboration with Brainport’s large high-tech companies, (research) organizations and institutes, and many small/medium enterprises. The department’s close collaborations and relationships within the Brainport region enables staff and students to contribute directly to the technological innovations and developments with real-world relevance. The department has produced a number of successful spin-offs, participates in many national and international research consortia, and is highly successful in obtaining national and European grant funding.
The ambition and challenges of M&CS
The departmental board focuses on five main topics for the next few years: the reduction of workload, strengthening the (research) position of M&CS, improve the support processes for the department, further increase diversity, and improve governance towards proactive and fast decision making.
The strengthening of the position of M&CS should be reached via stronger collaboration with TU/e departments & institutes, building external research consortia with organizations and industry, increase valorization efforts through virtual and physical (science) labs , develop and align research lines (from fundamental to applied and back), implementing the new bachelor program with challenged-based learning elements, and support a possible scale jump. The scale jump is the TU/e ambition of doubling the number of master's, PhD’s, and EngD’s degree graduates by 2032 to meet the rapidly growing need of the Brainport region for engineers. The strongest increase is anticipated in master's programs in the fields of greatest need, including computer science (part of the department of M&CS).
As Vice-Dean you will help accomplish our ambitions through planning, directing, and implementing programs, policies and procedures for M&CS in partnership with the other members of the department board (and its advisors). You will help develop the department strategy and directing efforts to achieve its goals:
Formulate a vision regarding the future profile of the department and its individual disciplines. You will foster the development oriented mindset, as well as inspire and respond to modernization and innovation in these specific scientific areas;
