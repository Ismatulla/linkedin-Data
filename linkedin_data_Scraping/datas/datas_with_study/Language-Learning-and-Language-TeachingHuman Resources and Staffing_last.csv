Chair in Medieval English Literature and Culture,"Chair in Medieval English Literature and Culture - University of Groningen
Situated in the bustling economic and cultural capital of the region, the University of Groningen is a research-intensive university with a truly global outlook that attracts a large number of staff and students from the Netherlands and internationally.
Since its foundation in 1614, the University of Groningen has established an international reputation as a dynamic and innovative university offering high quality teaching and research. Its 30,000 students are encouraged to develop their own individual talents through challenging study and career paths. The University of Groningen is an international centre of knowledge: it belongs to the best research universities in Europe and is allied with prestigious partner universities and networks worldwide. The University of Groningen has a strong commitment to the principles and practices of diversity and inclusion throughout the University community and welcomes candidates who enhance that diversity.
The Faculty of Arts is building on a long-standing tradition of four centuries, and its mission is to create positive societal and academic impact through relevant, high-quality teaching and research. The faculty strives to remain an ambitious top-ranking faculty with excellent education and state-of-the-art research, with a strong international orientation, firmly rooted in the North of The Netherlands. The faculty builds and shares knowledge which benefits society, and educates over 5.000 Dutch and international students to become forward-looking, articulate and independent academics.
The faculty offers a multidisciplinary environment and a wide range of degree programmes. Its research, which is internationally acclaimed, covers the fields of Archaeology, Cultural Studies, History, International Relations, Journalism, Language and Literary Studies, and Linguistics.
Research conducted at the Faculty of Arts is very diverse and multidisciplinary and organised in research institutes, each comprised of multiple smaller research groups. Medieval English Literature and Culture encompasses the literatures of medieval England and continental Europe from late antiquity to around 1500, and includes literature in Old English, Early Middle English, Late Middle English and Older Scots. The curriculum of Medieval English Literature and Culture covers a wide variety of medieval and early modern texts as phenomena which are studied, criticised and edited from their original forms with a universal transcultural empathy adequate to the twenty-first century.
The Faculty of Arts is seeking to appoint a Chair of Medieval English Literature and Culture to complement and reinforce the existing strengths and the future of literary studies. This role is particularly suitable for an enthusiastic academic leader who shows a willingness and ability to lead the Medieval English Literature and Culture group and to strengthen its research profile and promote the academic talent and career development of the team.

The successful candidate is internationally renowned in the field and has a relevant, strategic national and international network – demonstrated, for example, by invited lectures and participation in conferences, conference organisation and a leading role in relevant professional organisations and editorial boards of academic journals in the field.
The new Chair is able to create and strengthen collaborations within the Faculty and University and with the broader research field and society.
