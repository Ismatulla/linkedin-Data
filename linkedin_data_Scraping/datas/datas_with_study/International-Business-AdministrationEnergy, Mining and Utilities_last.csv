The oil supply and trading environment is often dynamic and fast moving. Operators often have to be able to respond quickly and accurately to challenging and sometimes conflicting deadlines in order to comply with business needs and policy guidelines.
The ability to prioritize from several potentially conflicting tasks whilst keeping a cool head is essential to success in dealings with internal and external customers.

Energy is a fundamental basic need of our society. Fossil fuels, including oil, are an essential source of energy and will remain so until renewable energies have the capacity to meet the growing demand for energy.
Nearly 5,000 SBMers globally are proud to design, build and operate floating facilities that produce more than 1% of the world’s oil. We do it in the safest, most affordable, and most sustainable way. And we continuously strive to reduce emissions, in line with our emissionZEROTM program.

As a leader in floating technologies for the oil and gas industry, we recognize the significant importance of climate change and the growing need for renewable energy. We invest in products and services that enable the transition towards renewable energy, with a focus on Floating Offshore Wind, Wave Energy, and Carbon Capture and Storage. In addition, we also develop Smart Digital Services to improve and support everything we do.
Oceans play a central role in producing the energy of today and of tomorrow. We work together with the world’s leading energy companies to make that happen. We act responsibly and ethically so that communities where we operate benefit from our presence and activities.

We are committed to sharing our experience to deliver safe, sustainable, and affordable energy from the oceans for generations to come.

We are Energy. Committed.
