PhD candidate 'Genetic and (neuro)biological mechanisms underlying self-regulation in youth',"4 years What are the optimal conditions for youth to grow up successfully? Join the GUTS consortium as a PhD candidate and learn to do cutting edge research on the genetics of self-regulation, adolescent behaviour, and brain development in an interdisciplinary team. Do you enjoy working in a vibrant team that wants to push the frontiers of science? Do you believe that young people should be involved in shaping our research questions? And would you like your research to have an impact in society? Then this position may be the perfect fit for you.

How do young people successfully grow up in an increasingly complex society, and what are the main causes for differences in becoming engaged and contributing citizens in society? Your PhD project is part of the larger consortium Growing Up Together in Society (GUTS) where seven Dutch universities collaborate to find answers to the question of how young people grow up successfully. This PhD project is part of a subteam of the project that operates in Nijmegen, in an interdisciplinary research group at Radboudumc. In addition, the GUTS project offers opportunities to develop yourself in terms of interdisciplinary research, societal impact, outreach, and open science.

This project bridges life sciences with social sciences, as it aims to investigate the underlying genetics of self-regulation, an important trait in young people that can affect their life outcomes in society. In our innovative study, we take genetics as a point of departure to understand the underlying biology of self-regulation. We will combine the strengths of large-scale data sources available from international consortia (e.g., UK Biobank, ABCD Study) and combine it with unique and deeply phenotyped local resources. We will use state-of-the-art statistical genetic methods to characterize individuals in the cohorts in terms of their genetic self-regulation profiles and examine whether such genetic profiles are a predictor of the individuals’ life outcomes. In addition, we will link the genomic profiles to the individuals’ cognitive performance and brain structure and function.

Part of the project will implement artificial intelligence/machine learning approaches to predict life outcomes based on genetics as well as other factors, and to develop potential preventive strategies against adverse life outcomes. In this project you will become skilled in developing hypotheses and analyzing large scale data, publishing in peer-reviewed journals, and presenting your work at conferences. The project will be supervised by prof. dr. Barbara Franke (Radboudumc Nijmegen), prof. dr. Mark de Rooij (Leiden University), dr. Marieke Klein and dr. Janita Bralten (both Radboudumc Nijmegen). In our research group at the Radboudumc, we investigate the genetic underpinnings of cognitive/psychiatric traits in the general population and psychiatric disorders, such as ADHD and autism. This PhD project is part of work package 4 of the GUTS consortium, led by Hilleke Hulshoff Pol (Utrecht University).
The successful applicant will be enrolled in the Donders Graduate School. It is expected that you will submit a high-quality dissertation for examination within four years of your appointment.

 Job description
Job description
To make better decisions regarding healthcare use and lifestyle choices, we need information about the benefits and costs of these decisions. Different types of large-scale observational data sets, such as cohort studies, clinical registries and claims data, typically contain information on different types of descriptive data, benefits and costs. Analyzing these different types of data using a multidisciplinary approach holds the promise to deliver new insights that may help to improve health-related decisions at the individual, the organizational and the system level. We are a multidisciplinary group who are initiating the project ‘A Lifecourse and Individual-based View on Lifestyle to Enhance health’ (ALIVE). ALIVE is one out of ten multidisciplinary Convergence Flagship projects that is jointly initiated and funded by Erasmus Medical Center, Erasmus University Rotterdam and Delft University of Technology for the duration of five years.

This research project is embedded in the Convergence Health & Technology: Shaping the future of health and healthcare. For this project, we are recruiting a postdoctoral fellow. This researcher will work on peer-reviewed publications on combining large observational data sets. This will not only contribute to answering important questions in a way that is not feasible when analyzing these data separately, but this will also be used as showcases that show the potential of combining data to other researchers at Erasmus MC and beyond. We have access to observational data and have started obtaining permission to link these data. These data enable us to apply the idea of biological age to brain data and use this framework to study disease-related decisions such as lifestyle choices and decisions related to care use. The postdoctoral fellow will generate findings on the health and health care use of people with specific diseases such as dementia. For this, the postdoctoral fellow will build on ideas developed as part of Convergence and leverage the unique datasets available to the team with their own ideas and their quantitative research skills. The findings will be published in scientific articles and presentations.

Furthermore, the postdoctoral fellow will be taking the lead in creating a data science network to collect, combine and provide data to support cross-study (e.g., cohorts, registries, national databases) and use their central position within the ALIVE project to play a key role in multidisciplinary research collaborations. The postdoctoral fellow will have the opportunity to participate in courses related to the research agenda
Work environment
Work environment
A healthy population and excellence in healthcare through research and education. This is what Erasmus MC stands for. Conducting groundbreaking work, pushing boundaries and leading the way in research, education, and healthcare. We are practical people with a high level of expertise, working hard to improve and renew the healthcare of today and the public health of tomorrow.

You will be primarily appointed at the Department of Epidemiology but will be closely working together with the Health Economics department at the Erasmus School of Health Policy and Management, and several other clinical departments. In addition, you will play a key role in the Convergence Flagship “A Lifecourse and Individual-based View on Lifestyle to Enhance health (ALIVE)”. Within convergence, TU Delft, Erasmus University Rotterdam and Erasmus MC have joined forces. The urgent and complex societal challenges of our time ask for fundamentally new forms of cooperation, whereby the boundaries between institutes and disciplines are crossed to create new perspectives and solutions. This means that you will work with researchers from multiple disciplines at all three research institutes. This active role in within the ALIVE Flagship means that, in addition to doing research, you contribute to the flagship in other ways. Specifically, you take the lead in developing a business plan to make the knowledge that is acquired and centralized within this Flagship a viable service that may be provided to researchers of TU Delft, Erasmus MC and Erasmus University in the long-term. Furthermore, you work with other researchers to identify, get access to, and combine the datasets needed for their projects.
