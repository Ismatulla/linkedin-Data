Do you want to become an expert in the defense of our Nation’s critical space infrastructure?
Perhaps you heard about the standing up of the United States Space Force in December 2019, the first new military service in over 70 years? Did you hear about the formation of the United States Space Command in August 2019? There is even a Netflix comedy series called Space Force that debuted a few years ago. Maybe you asked yourself why all of this is happening?
Check out the CBS 60 Minutes episode The Battle Above, the CNN documentary War in Space, and the Defense Intelligence Agency 2022 report on Challenges to Security in Space to learn more.
The Space Control Applications Group of the APL Space Exploration Sector primarily focuses on the Space Control mission area that has three components:
Space Domain Awareness – knowledge and characterization of space objects and the operational environment upon which space operations depend
Defensive Space Control – active and passive means to protect United States and coalition partners’ space capabilities from attack, interference, or unintentional hazards
Offensive Space Control – deterrence of adversary hostile actions in space by fielding capabilities that negate an adversary’s use of space
Our group tackles these challenges by developing a wide array of technology solutions for data fusion, dynamic sensor tasking, mission optimization, machine learning, modeling and simulation, mission concept development, system validation, performance assessments, photonic systems, remote sensing, space object signatures across the electromagnetic spectrum, space warfighting operations, battle management, command and control, and multi-intelligence fusion.
Our staff come from diverse backgrounds and heavily leverage programming skills (e.g. C, C++, Matlab, Python) and modeling skills (e.g. Systems Tool Kit, Astrogator, Thermal Desktop, PTC Creo). We hire from many disciplines including engineering, physics, astronomy, applied mathematics, and computer science.
If you are a PhD and willing to learn about space and a completely new warfighting domain and you enjoy computer simulations, programming, and more importantly want to be a part of building payloads and spacecraft, you might very well be the perfect addition to our group!
Since we support defense and intelligence community customers, all personnel must undergo a security screening process to obtain a Top Secret clearance and primarily work in classified environments.

Qualifications
You meet our minimum qualifications for the job if you...
Possess a PhD in any Engineering discipline, Physics, Astronomy, Mathematics, Computer Science, or related technical field
Are skilled in technologies related to space control applications
Are willing and able to occasionally travel to sponsor locations
Are able to obtain an Interim Secret Clearance by your start date and can ultimately obtain a Top Secret/SCI security clearance. If selected, you will be subject to a government security clearance investigation and must meet the requirements for access to classified information. Eligibility requirements include U.S. citizenship
Can demonstrate that you are fully vaccinated against COVID-19. To ensure the safety and well-being of the community, APL has established a policy requiring that all staff be vaccinated against COVID-19. All staff members must provide proof of full vaccination or have an approved medical or religious accommodation by their start date.
You'll go above and beyond our minimum requirements if you...
Hold a current Top Secret clearance with SCI adjudication
Have research experience in one of many group disciplines mentioned above
Have internship experience in national security

Maybe you asked yourself why all of this is happening.
Check out the CBS 60 Minutes episode The Battle Above, the CNN documentary War in Space, and the Defense Intelligence Agency 2022 report on Challenges to Security in Space to learn more.
The Space Control Applications Group of the APL Space Exploration Sector primarily focuses on the Space Control mission area that has three components:
Space Domain Awareness – knowledge and characterization of space objects and the operational environment upon which space operations depend
Defensive Space Control – active and passive means to protect United States and coalition partners’ space capabilities from attack, interference, or unintentional hazards
Offensive Space Control – deterrence of adversary hostile actions in space by fielding capabilities that negate an adversary’s use of space
Our group tackles these challenges by developing a wide array of technology solutions for data fusion, dynamic sensor tasking, mission optimization, machine learning, modeling and simulation, mission concept development, system validation, performance assessments, photonic systems, remote sensing, space object signatures across the electromagnetic spectrum, space warfighting operations, battle management, command and control, and multi-intelligence fusion.
Our staff come from diverse backgrounds and heavily leverage programming skills (e.g. C, C++, Matlab, Python) and modeling skills (e.g. Systems Tool Kit, Astrogator, Thermal Desktop, PTC Creo). We hire from many disciplines including engineering, physics, astronomy, applied mathematics, and computer science.
If you are willing to learn about space and a completely new warfighting domain and you enjoy computer simulations, programming, and more importantly want to be a part of building payloads and spacecraft, you might very well be the perfect addition to our group!
Since we support defense and intelligence community customers, all personnel must undergo a security screening process to obtain a Top Secret clearance and primarily work in classified environments.

Can demonstrate that you are fully vaccinated against COVID-19. To ensure the safety and well-being of the community, APL has established a policy requiring that all staff be vaccinated against COVID-19. All staff members must provide proof of full vaccination or have an approved medical or religious accommodation by their start date.
You'll go above and beyond our minimum requirements if you...
