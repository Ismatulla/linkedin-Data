Stage | Afstuderen bij de afdeling Data Science,"Wat ga je doen?
De afdeling Data Science creëert inzicht uit grote hoeveelheden, ongestructureerde, en vaak dynamische data sets. Deze data zijn bijvoorbeeld afkomstig van internet, zoals sociale media en discussiefora, maar kunnen ook bestaan uit sensordata en logfiles van transacties. We werken samen met onze klanten aan nieuwe methodes om in grootschalige heterogene data (tekst, audio, video, etc.) te kunnen zoeken, verbanden te kunnen leggen en trends te kunnen ontdekken. Daarbij richten we ons op het zo transparant mogelijk maken van de gehele keten van informatieverwerking, van bron tot menselijke beslissing. Speel jij graag een rol in het aanbrengen van fundamentele verbeteringen in deze methodes op basis van grote hoeveelheden data?

Deze vacature is een algemene vacature voor afstudeeropdrachten van 6-9 maanden, en stageopdrachten van minimaal 3 maanden. De mogelijkheden zullen per periode verschillen, afhankelijk van de projecten die we op dit moment hebben. Deze vacature is zeer breed en een concrete opdracht, die aansluit bij jouw interesses én de vraagstukken van TNO, zal in onderling overlegvormgegeven worden. Er is hierbij veel ruimte voor eigen ideeën en inbreng.

Over het algemeen hebben we opdrachten op één van de volgende onderwerpen:
Het toepassen van je AI en Machine Learning kennis en ervaring, waaronder data sanitisation, secure data analytics, and bias-reduction technieken. Met deze technieken wordt data op een responsible manier gecombineerd in steeds meer toepassingsdomeinen, zoals Veiligheid, Defensie of Overheid. Voorbeelden hiervan zijn het inzetten van de FACT en FAIR principes, secure of federated learning.
Het toepassen van je text mining kennis en ervaring, waaronder Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning en kennisrepresentatie technieken. Met deze technieken worden kennis en data gecombineerd in steeds meer toepassingsdomeinen, zoals Veiligheid, Defensie, Law Enforcement of Agricultuur. Voorbeelden hiervan zijn het inzetten van Explainable AI (incl. visualisatie) en embeddings.
Het toepassen van je kennisrepresentatietechnieken, waaronder semantic web, ontologies, reasoning, en symbolic AI. Met deze technieken worden vraagstukken rondom het beschikbaar stellen van data en het uitwisselen van data met andere organisaties gestructureerd. Toepassingsdomeinen zijn onder andere Overheid en Agricultuur.
Zo maken we een model om vacatures en werkzoekenden bij elkaar te brengen op basis van skills in plaats van soms verouderde werkervaring (https://www.samenvoordeklant.nl/praktijk/een-verbindende-taal-voor-arbeidsbemiddeling-competentnl). Op onze virtuele lab omgeving Appl.AI (https://appl-ai-tno.nl/projects) staan diverse projecten waaraan onze afdeling werkt, bijvoorbeeld AI Skills Matching, AI4Justice, BigMedilytics, Early detectin of Covid outbreaks, Fair Machine Learning, Hybrid AI Explainability, Patient Forum Miner, Think or Sink, Adverserial AI.

Speaking Dutch is not strictly necessary for this vacancy; there may be projects though in which (part of) the documentation is written in Dutch.
Wat wij van jou verwachten
We zoeken een enthousiaste WO afstudeerder Kunstmatige Intelligentie, Informatica, Bedrijfsinformatie technologie, Technische bedrijfskunde, Econometrie of Linguïstiek met interesse in data of kennisrepresentatie.

Over het algemeen zijn we op zoek naar studenten met:
