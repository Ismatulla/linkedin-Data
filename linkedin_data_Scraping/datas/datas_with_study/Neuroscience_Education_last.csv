PhD position: Selective synapse vulnerabilities in Alzheimer’s disease,"Location: AMSTERDAM

FTE: 1 - 1
Job description
The Dementia Science team is looking for a talented PhD candidate for a 4-year project to be carried out at the Molecular and Cellular Neurobiology (MCN) section of the Center for Neurogenomics and Cognitive Research (CNCR) at the VU University Amsterdam.


Within the Dementia Research Program of ZonMw, six multidisciplinary research consortia were recently funded to boost large-scale integrative dementia research in the Netherlands. The MODEM (mechanisms of dementia) consortium will study disease mechanisms of Alzheimer’s disease, frontotemporal dementia and vascular dementia with 15 PhD projects across research institutes in the Netherlands. Three PhD projects are devoted to studying neuronal synapse and network impairments in Alzheimer’s disease using mouse models and iPSC-derived neurons. For one of these projects we are currently hiring.


Hippocampal inhibitory interneurons show early changes in excitability that are causally linked to the development neuronal network imbalance and memory impairment in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In this project we want to investigate which synaptic changes are responsible for these network changes. We will make use of a recently developed fluorescence-assisted synapse sorting (FASS) methods and highly sensitive mass spectrometric proteomic profiling to study at the molecular level the selective vulnerability of inhibitory vs excitatory synapses, synapses onto and originating from PV neurons and synapses onto and between engram neurons that store memories. We also obtained iPSC lines from multiple familial AD patients that will be used to generate mixed excitatory/inhibitory neuronal cultures that will also be assessed for changes in synaptic and network activity. The aim is to identify molecular targets that are specific for AD-associated synaptic impairments and with high translational value.


Your duties
You will use stateof-the-art cellular and molecular approaches in neuroscience to identify and validate proteomic changes at the synapse that are relevant to AD.
You will have the opportunity to teach and supervise bachelor and master students
Requirements
We look for highly motivated candidates with a strong background in cellular and molecular neuroscience.
Prior experience with (iPSC) cell culture techniques and (large scale) protein analysis approaches is a plus.
What are we offering?
A challenging position in a socially involved organization. The salary will be in accordance with university regulations for academic personnel and amounts €2,541 (PhD) per month during the first year and increases to €3,247 (PhD) per month during the fourth year, based on a full-time employment. The job profile: is based on the university job ranking system and is vacant for at least 1 FTE.


The appointment will initially be for 1 year. After a satisfactory evaluation of the initial appointment, the contract will be extended for a duration of 4 years.

Whereas hundreds of neuronal synaptic proteins have been identified, and functional insight into their role in synaptic transmission is increasing, it is largely unknown which astrocyte proteins are involved in physical interaction with synapses and how they execute control over synaptic function. The overall aim of the project is to obtain in-depth insight into the molecular mechanism that controls synaptic function in memory circuitry by dynamically changing astrocyte-synapse interactions.


The candidate will identify relevant astrocyte-neuron protein interactions and perform manipulation of these proteins to study their structural and functional interaction. The studies will involve biomolecular analysis and imaging of protein-protein interactions in mice, in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, experiments will involve stereotactic surgeries to virally target astrocytes in specific brain regions implicated in memory. As such, we are looking for a candidate with an interest in molecular and cellular neuroscience. Experience with proteomic and/or biomolecular techniques is an advantage.

Requirements
MSc degree in neuroscience or biomolecular science (or equivalent)
Research experience in molecular and cellular biology
Fluent in English (spoken and written)
What are we offering?
A challenging position in a socially involved organization. The salary will be in accordance with university regulations for academic personnel and amounts €2,541 (PhD) per month during the first year and increases to €3,247 (PhD) per month during the fourth year, based on a full-time employment. The job profile: is based on the university job ranking system and is vacant for at least 1 FTE.


The appointment will initially be for 1 year. After a satisfactory evaluation of the initial appointment, the contract will be extended for a duration of 3 years.

Additionally, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam offers excellent fringe benefits and various schemes and regulations to promote a good work/life balance, such as:
8% holiday allowance and 8.3% end-of-year bonus

PhD in modelling the effects of light on health in the context of everyday life,"Job description
Are you fascinated by light, health, and data mining?
The Department of Industrial Engineering & Innovation Sciences of Eindhoven University of Technology has a PhD position on the quantification of the effects of light on health in the Human Technology Interaction (HTI) group. The project is funded within the TU/e Eurotech PhD program and performed in close collaboration with the Laboratory of Integrated Performance in Design (LIPID) at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL).
We are seeking an enthusiastic, ambitious young researcher to work in our team on the execution of the Eurotech PhD project titled “Health illuminated: Quantified effects of light on health”.
Job description
Research context: Light exposure through the eyes has a powerful impact on health. Yet, adopting a healthy light hygiene is seriously challenged in our modern society - with abundant time spent indoors during daytime and screen usage and engagement in social activities in the late evening and at night. These aberrant light exposure patterns may induce serious risks for health, via – among others – dysregulation of the circadian system. Nevertheless, a reliable and valid quantitative description of people’s actual – and by extension, optimized – 24-h time profiles regarding light exposure is still missing.
Research aim: In the current project, we aim to employ data mining strategies to enhance the quantification of light exposure patterns monitored in the context of everyday life and advance the understanding and modelling of effects of light on health in real-life. To this end, we will leverage existing data and complement these data with new data collected using light sensor technology that can also accurately monitor the spectral characteristics of light. These sensor data will be combined with self-reports and with behavioral and physiological markers of health to uncover which light-related features and aggregations render effective predictions of key health indicators and to improve the mapping of light sensor data to human behavior and experiences in the context of light and health.
You will conduct your research under the supervision of dr. Karin Smolders (TU/e), Prof. Yvonne de Kort (TU/e), and Prof. Marilyne Andersen (EPFL). You will be a member of the light group of HTI at TU/e, the Intelligent Lighting Institute of the TU/e, and the LIPID research group at EPFL.

Job requirements
Talented, enthusiastic candidates with excellent analytical and communication skills holding a master’s degree or an equivalent university degree in chronobiology, data science, neuroscience, human-technology interaction, health sciences or a related discipline are encouraged to apply. The following experience and skillsets are preferred:
Experience with and affinity for working in the chronobiology, psychology and/or neurophysiology fields
Advanced statistical and programming skills.
Expertise with empirical research among humans
A strong interest in lighting and psychology research
A research-oriented attitude
Strong conceptual thinking and planning skills; you are creative and proactive
Ability to work in an international and multidisciplinary team
Fluent in spoken and written English.
Comfortable to travel for stays of several months at EPFL, Switzerland.
Conditions of employment
A meaningful job in a dynamic and ambitious university, in an interdisciplinary setting and within an international network. You will work on a beautiful, green campus within walking distance of the central train station. In addition, we offer you:
Full-time employment for four years, with an intermediate evaluation (go/no-go) after nine months. You will spend 10% of your employment on teaching tasks.
Salary and benefits (such as a pension scheme, paid pregnancy and maternity leave, partially paid parental leave) in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities.
A year-end bonus of 8.3% and annual vacation pay of 8%.
High-quality training programs and other support to grow into a self-aware, autonomous scientific researcher. At TU/e we challenge you to take charge of your own learning process.
An excellent technical infrastructure, on-campus children's day care and sports facilities.
An allowance for commuting, working from home and internet costs.
A Staff Immigration Team and a tax compensation scheme (the 30% facility) for international candidates.

Do you have a PhD in artificial intelligence and would you like to contribute to helping and preventing the treatment of student mental well-being? As a postdoc, you will identify and model the network structure of student mental well-being components, as input for the development of chatbots that can support students in their well-being. Join a young, enthusiastic and synergistic research team working at different universities, where you can put your ideas to the test and push your boundaries.

Poor student mental well-being (StMWB) is increasingly recognised as a major public health burden. Due to a lack of understanding how different aspects of StMWB overlap and dynamically evolve over time, interventions to prevent or treat poor StMWB have only limited success. The research goal of the What's BOThering You project is to identify the network structure of StMWB components over time using a network-oriented modelling approach, and to model this dynamic network computationally. This way we aim to uncover and provide novel insights into the complex networks of StMWB components of higher education students over time, leading to a multidimensional, dynamic and personalised network model of StMWB. The model serves as input for the development and evaluation of personalised and engaging conversational agents (i.e. chatbots) that can support students in their well-being. Such chatbots can lower the threshold for young people to seek help for their mental health problems, using technology they already have experience with.
The project consortium blends unique expertise in mental health, communication science, artificial intelligence, and educational sciences, and employs cutting-edge methodologies, such as ecological momentary assessment, dynamic computational modelling, co-creation, and chatbot technology. The project has an iterative and integrative structure and is being carried out by a young, enthusiastic, synergistic research team working at different universities. The outcomes of the project will improve our theoretical understanding of the dynamic intra-individual network structure of StMWB and enhance our knowledge of the applicability of dynamic computational models and chatbots to effectively and automatically counsel students who seek support for their mental well-being.

For this project, we are looking for a postdoctoral researcher with a background in Artificial Intelligence who has affinity with social science research and student well-being. Your main role will be to lead the technical studies in the project, which are aimed at developing a dynamic network model of StMWB and integrating it within a chatbot intervention. You will collaborate with two PhD candidates employed by the Open University of the Netherlands and Tilburg University, respectively.

In addition to research, you will spend 20% of your working time on teaching. The teaching duties will be embedded in the programmes of Artificial Intelligence and/or Communication Science, depending on your background and interests. You will have the opportunity to contribute to relevant Bachelor's and/or Master's degree courses, such as Human-Machine Communication and Digital Skills in Social Media.
