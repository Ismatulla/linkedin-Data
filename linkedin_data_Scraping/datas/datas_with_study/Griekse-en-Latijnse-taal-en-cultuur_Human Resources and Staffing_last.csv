We are the advisor of choice among top companies seeking guidance on senior leadership needs and have unrivalled access to leading executives around the world. Our clients range across industries and vary in size from large multinationals to medium-sized businesses and entrepreneurial start-ups. We also serve key nonprofit organizations around the world.
Our clients are going through continuous transformation, navigating through a pandemic and responding to macro trends such as digital disruption, ESG and DE&I commitments, sector consolidation, globalization, and even greater competitive and regulatory pressure. Our business is transforming too. Guided by our shared purpose and values, we believe leadership can be a powerful force for good and are motivated and inspired by the impact of our work on people and organizations. Through our work, individuals are empowered to become their best selves as leaders; teams and organizations deliver sustainable growth; and the communities they serve thrive. Given this context, we are continually shaping our offering to meet our clients’ needs and developing our technology platforms and tools to deliver high quality services in an effective way to our current and future clients.
Client Development Team (CDT)
Spencer Stuart is investing in our approach to business development, with a focus on more effective client targeting, improving the quality and impact of our interactions with potential clients, and creating a more competitive approach to business development. Spencer Stuart’s Client Development Team (CDT) is focused on enabling these focus areas for the practices, working closely with consulting teams to acquire, organize, analyze and create the knowledge that differentiates Spencer Stuart in the market. The CDT’s role is to be a trusted partner for the practice in facilitating the development of client strategy, BD insight, go-to-market materials that build the firm's reputation as the preeminent global leadership advisory firm. The Practice Director (one for each global practice) is a critical member of the global practice leadership teams, and a pivotal member of the firm-wide CDT teams.
Industrial Practice
Spencer Stuart has advised some of the world’s most valued and largest companies (public and private). Our Industrial Practice operates within a global network, spanning strategic markets worldwide. We collaborate in best teams across locations and practice areas to ensure that every assignment we work on benefits from an optimal combination of industry, functional and geographic expertise.
The global Industrial team includes over 300 practice members across the spectrum of executive assistants, analysts, associates, client development managers, and consultants. Our longstanding, carefully nurtured relationships—combined with our global database and unique market knowledge—enable us immediate access to the talent we seek for our clients. We organize ourselves by region (Americas and EMEA/APAC), and further refine our expertise by operating in global sectors, including Natural Resources, Process Industries, Engineered Products & Solutions, Infrastructure and Transportation, Logistics & Services.
To achieve our ambitious growth objectives, the Industrial practice has five strategic pillars:
Our People: hiring world class talent into our practice to address our evolving clients’ needs; and enhancing our onboarding and career development opportunities

Business Development: exploring new ways of working to leverage all members of the practice (not just consultants) to drive business development opportunities; technology will be a critical enabler of our work and facilitator of our processes
Our Culture: maintain the practice culture, which is built on a global teamwork, mutual trust, caring about each other, and the results/outcomes we achieve for clients, candidates and our Firm

This individual will act as a trusted advisor and management ‘muscle’ for the Global Practice Leader (GPL), representing the GPL in meetings and initiatives to help facilitate progress and decision making.
