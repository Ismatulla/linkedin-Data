The Department of Art and Culture Studies in the Faculty of Humanities is looking for an Assistant professor ‘Museums and Social Justice’ to build upon and extend existing research strengths on this topic within the Amsterdam School of Historical Studies (ASH).

What are you going to do?

You will provide education in a dynamic context with ample opportunities for the development of innovative teaching methods. Your research will be part of ASH, one of the five research schools of the Amsterdam Institute for Humanities Research. ASH represents and fosters the study of the human past from Antiquity to the present day. It brings together more than 200 academics from Amsterdam’s Faculty of Humanities, who participate in ca. 25 research groups. Given the wide range of research groups/centres within ASH, depending on your expertise you will join one of these groups, for example the Amsterdam Centre of Urban History or Amsterdam Centre of Early Modernity, and/or help establish new research groups focused on public history and imperial history.

You will develop and provide modules within the field of contemporary museology in the context of the interdisciplinary Bachelor Global Arts, Culture and Politics, and the MAs Museum Studies, and Heritage and Memory Studies. The post holder will likely be asked to contribute to majors in Culture and Social Justice, Reimagining Sustainability, and Art, Media and Visual Culture within the Bachelor Global Arts, Culture and Politics. Important is proven flexibility in teaching on topics beyond your own research focus, a willingness to work in interdisciplinary teams of teachers, and the ability to offer inspiring lectures and tutorials in BA, MA and minor programmes that cater to a wide range of students.
The Faculty of Humanities provides education and conducts research with a strong international profile in a large number of disciplines in the field of language and culture. Located in the heart of Amsterdam, the Faculty maintains close ties with many cultural institutes in the capital city. Research and teaching staff focus on interdisciplinary collaboration and are active in several teaching programmes. The Faculty of Humanities offers assistant professors the opportunity to collaborate with leading researchers at research institutes that - partly as a result of their interdisciplinary approach - are world-renowned. Moreover, you will be teaching in a dynamic context in which new teaching methods are being developed. Arts and Culture at UvA is a large and highly successful academic department that connects research and teaching in Art History, Cultural Studies, Theater Studies, Music Studies, Heritage and Memory Studies, and Museum Studies.

Tasks and responsibilities:
designing and conducting independent research in the area of museums and social justice, building upon and extending existing research strengths on this topic within ASH and the University of Amsterdam;
active engagement in ASH research groups and seminars actively pursuing external funding for research, notably funding from research councils, national as well as European;

The Context

The Computer Science department of the University of Twente is expanding. Therefore, we are hiring 6 new faculty members, to strengthen our research in Artificial Intelligence, Cyberphysical systems and Software Engineering in the domains of (1) e-Health and (2) energy and sustainability. These new faculty members will be assigned in different research groups, but inter-group collaboration with other researchers working on these themes is considered essential to reach our overall ambitions. One of the six positions is in the Human Media Interaction (HMI) group and focusses on research in e-Health.


The Position

Research into multimodal conversational systems such as chatbots, virtual humans, or social robots to coach people to live a healthier lifestyle, both from a physical and mental perspective, has seen a steady growth in the past couple of years. With the introduction of conversational systems such as ChatGPT and Bard, it looks as if smooth natural language conversations with an AI system have become possible. However, lifestyle coaching systems need a more sensitive and controlled mechanism to decide on what personalized advice to give. They need to be sensitive to the possibly vulnerable physical and mental state of the user and be aware of the possible effects of their advice. Furthermore, the information they provide should be communicated in a convincing way, but also be reliable and trustworthy. We are looking for a candidate with an AI background that can contribute to intelligent systems that can realise these goals.

Human Media Interaction (HMI) is a diverse and interdisciplinary research group that studies and designs interactive systems that users can intuitively interact with, ranging from Brain Computer Interfaces to Conversational Systems and Ambient Intelligence applications. In the area of Conversational Systems, HMI has expertise on speech technology, dialogue systems, embodied conversational agents and social robots. On the theme of e-Health, HMI has a strong tradition in contributing to a variety of coaching systems such as applications to increase physical fitness, advice on particular conditions (asthma, diabetes), or helping people to stop smoking or drinking. Research is conducted in coalitions with other research groups from inside and outside the University of Twente and with external stakeholders such as hospitals, rehabilitation centers, elderly homes, etcetera.

Your profile
You have a strong interest and have shown ability to collaborate in an academic, multidisciplinary environment;
You have a PhD degree in Computer Science, or related discipline with a focus on relevant areas in Artificial Intelligence;

You have shown a willingness to acquire external funding and are prepared to expand your skills in this respect;
You have good communication skills and are a team player;
You are fluent in English (knowledge of, or willingness to learn Dutch is an advantage);
You have a University Teaching Qualification (Dutch: BKO) or equivalent or you are willing to acquire one within three years.
Our offer
We offer a permanent position with a one-year probationary period (formally a 1-year contract with prospect of permanent contract).
The position comes with a start-up package that will be allow you to appoint one PhD student.
Our terms of employment are in accordance with the Dutch Collective Labor Agreement for Universities (CAO) and include a holiday allowance of 8% of the gross annual salary and a year-end bonus of 8.3%.
Depending on your relevant background and experience, the gross monthly salary on a full-time basis ranges from € 3974,- (scale 11) to € 6181,- (scale 12) gross per month.
A minimum of 29 leave days in case of full-time employment based on a formal workweek of 38 hours. A fulltime employment in practice means 40 hours a week, therefore resulting in 96 extra leave hours on an annual basis.
A solid pension scheme.
Free access to sport facilities on campus.
We are a family-friendly institution, which offers parental leave for both parents (both paid and unpaid) and career support for partners.
We appreciate diversity of profiles, cultures, and backgrounds, and promote an inclusive working culture.
Furthermore, we offer excellent professional and personal development programs.
Finally, you will work in a lively, inspiring, and dynamic working environment in an organization focusing on internationalization, where you will have a high degree of responsibility and independence.

About the department

The Clinical Neuropsychology department of the VU University Amsterdam links education to research, with a strong connection to clinical practice. The research in this department ultimately aims to improve care and everyday daily life for patients with various neurocognitive disorders. Many of our faculty members are also affiliated with a clinical institution to further strengthen the link between research and clinical practice. The research lines of the Clinical Neuropsychology department cover the entire life span, from early childhood to extreme aging and include (a) diagnosing dysfunctions, (b) understanding mechanisms of (dys)functioning, and (c) developing interventions for retaining or improving brain functions. By mapping behavior and brain functions using advanced techniques, we aim to study which brain functions are affected by adverse events, and which functions remain intact and can be improved, for example by studying physical activity and cognitive training. We are currently expanding our research and educational activities, meeting the growing demand for clinical neuropsychology in society. Do you want to contribute to education and research in this field? Then apply at VU University Amsterdam (VU).

About the project

Parental involvement in a child's education, including talking and reading to them, has been linked to better academic performance. However, it is unclear whether this association is causal or due to other factors such as genetics. To identify the causal effects of the home learning environment, we need to control for genetics. The InterGen project aims to discover which aspects of the home learning environment causally impact children's language, reading, and math development. In the InterGen project, we will use a variety of innovative observational and experimental designs to study gene-environment interplay in children's educational development, like the children-of-twin design and a randomized controlled study. The InterGen project is funded by an ERC Starting Grant.

The Faculty of Law, Institute for Information Law (IViR), and the University Research Priority Area on Trust in the Digital Society (TRUST RPA: https://www.ivir.nl/trust-in-the-digital-society-new-uva-research-priority-area/ ) is looking for a postdoctoral researcher to study the institutional safeguards of trustworthy centralized and decentralized techno-social infrastructures.

The TRUST RPA is a five year long interdisciplinary research initiative to study how we trust is changing due to the emergence of new trust production technologies, and the disruption of existing trust relations.

The digital society relies on an ever-expanding network of digital infrastructures. This forces us to rethink some of our basic assumptions about one of the most fundamental resources in all interpersonal, social, economic relations: trust.
Despite their widespread use, we know little about the trustworthiness of our digital infrastructures. At best it is difficult to establish their trustworthiness (such as with AI), at worst they are proven to be untrustworthy (as is the case with social media).
Some of these digital infrastructures play key roles in interpersonal and societal trust dynamics. They disrupt existing trust relations and offer new ways to trust each other.
Our scientific methods and theories face serious limits when it comes to the study of change of social structures, institutions, and processes under the conditions of rapid technological transformation. Research on trust in technology and trust by technology is siloed, and focuses on narrowly defined technologies (AI), or problems (system security), and lacks a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, long-term-view.

This postdoctoral position (embedded in the TRUST RPA, supervised by both the Institute for Information Law, at the Amsterdam Law School, and at least one other participating faculty) will use empirical research to study how various new technological infrastructures disrupt or can enhance existing societal (impersonal, institutional) trust relations and strive to establish new forms of trust relations in society.

What are you going to do?

 The successful candidate will:
Conduct empirical, qualitative research (interviews, case studies, discourse analysis) on the dynamics of institutional, impersonal trust with regards to emerging digital technologies, such as digital platforms, web3 technologies, or Machine Learning based automated systems.
Coordinate the development, fieldwork and initial analysis of a large-scale longitudinal survey
Conduct work on the emerging European technology regulation framework (Digital Services Act, AI Act, Digital Markets Act) using doctrinal research, normative research and discourse analysis
Organize events, conferences
Participate in grant proposal development, international network building
Acquiree funding

The Postdoctoral researcher will be hired by the Faculty of Law, closely collaborating with two other postdoctoral researchers in the Trust RPA. The team will be supervised by the PIs of the TRUS RPA: Balazs Bodo, Associate Professor at the Institute of Information Law (IViR) at the Faculty of Law, Jan B. Engelmann, Professor of Neuroeconomics at the Amsterdam School of Economics, Theo Araujo, Associate Professor Communication in the Digital Society at the Amsterdam School of Communication Research (ASCoR), Tom van Engers, Professor in Legal Knowledge Management at the University of Amsterdam, and Marc Tuters, Assistant Professor in the New Media and Digital Culture Division of Media Studies at the Faculty of Humanities.

What do we require of you?

 The successful candidate has:
a PhD degree in law, or social sciences (sociology, economics, political science, communication science, science and technology studies or related fields)
strong empirical research skills;
familiarity with qualitative research methods,
familiarity with doctrinal research or policy research;
good knowledge of current developments in information markets and technology;
academic excellence, as shown in the grade transcripts and curriculum vitae.
a creative mind and analytical intelligence;
an interest in working in a multidisciplinary team;
willingness to learn new knowledge, and acquire new skills required by the project;
excellent written and spoken command of English, and ideally knowledge of Dutch
interest in working on interdisciplinary topics, in interdisciplinary teams.

Candidates, who have:
quantitative skills, including survey development, statistical analysis, and/or
familiarity with R, python or any other programming language, and/or
big data collection and analysis skills, and/or
previous experience in the private or public sector

will be given extra consideration in the application process.

We strongly encourage members of broadly understood minority socio-cultural groups to apply. We believe that there are several traditionally underrepresented, but incredibly forceful perspectives, that have transformed our respective disciplines. Recent scholarship by persons of colour, feminist, intersectionalist scholars, scholars from the Global South have highlighted fundamental issues with the design, operation, and impact of techno-social systems that remained in the blind spots of mainstream scholarship. Without such contributions, serious problems, such as racial bias in AI systems, would have gone unnoticed and left unaddressed by more careful technical design and better regulation.

Our offer

We offer a temporary employment contract for 38 hours per week for a period of 36 months with a probationary period of two months. The preferred starting date is as soon possible.
The gross monthly salary, based on 30,4 -38 (0.8-1 FTE) hours per week and dependent on relevant experience, ranges between € 2,960 to € 4,670 (scale 10). UvA additionally offers an extensive package of secondary benefits, including 8% holiday allowance and a year-end bonus of 8.3%. The UFO profile Researcher 4 is applicable. A favourable tax agreement, the ‘30% ruling’, may apply to non-Dutch applicants. The Collective Labour Agreement of Universities of the Netherlands is applicable.

Besides the salary and a vibrant and challenging environment we offer you multiple fringe benefits:
232 holiday hours per year (based on fulltime) and extra holidays between Christmas and 1 January;
Multiple courses to follow from our Teaching and Learning Centre;
Multiple courses on topics such as leadership for academic staff;
Multiple courses on topics such as time management, handling stress and an online learning platform with 100+ different courses;
7 weeks birth leave (partner leave) with 100% salary;
Partly paid parental leave;
The possibility to set up a workplace at home;
A pension at ABP for which UvA pays two third part of the contribution;
The possibility to follow courses to learn Dutch;

What else do we offer
the possibility to start up and grow a New Research priority Area at the UvA,
close working relations with five faculties of the UvA; and with TU Delft, and Erasmus University, Rotterdam
freedom to develop your own research agenda;
welcoming, international, dynamic teams;
an inspiring academic and professional environment in the heart of Amsterdam;
excellent possibilities for further professional development and education.

Social media have become increasingly important in people's daily lives. Young people in particular spend numerous hours in the online world and use social media as a primary means to manage their social lives. This has already prompted a surge in research on the uses and effects of social media. Interestingly, whilst the online world is often mirroring the offline world, it also provides distinct peer behaviours (e.g. victimisation, co-rumination, deficiency behaviour), potentially due to its unique characteristics (e.g. asynchronicity of communication, permanent availability, cue absence). Little is known about differences between young people's off- and online worlds; how they differently affect peer processes that are crucial for youth development and well-being; and how they impact behaviour.

In this PhD project, you will focus on peer processes on social media. Specifically, you will investigate the unique characteristics of peer processing in online worlds and their risks and opportunities. Subsequently, you will examine how they relate to (risky) behaviour in both on- and offline worlds. Within this general theme, you will have the flexibility to determine the specific focus of the project. Any innovative ideas you might already have about the project we would like to read in your motivation letter.

You will be employed within the Behavioural Science Institute (BSI), embedded in the Communication & Media research programme. As a PhD Candidate, you will initiate, develop and execute several studies. You will write scientific papers, resulting in the completion of a PhD thesis at the end of your employment contract. You will participate in supervision meetings as well as staff meetings of the Communication Science department and other relevant research meetings. As part of the BSI Graduate School PhD programme, you will be expected to complete several courses related to the basic professional skills of scientific researchers such as presentation skills, scientific integrity, and data management. We also encourage you to attend and present your work at relevant workshops and conferences. As part of your PhD position, you will have a 10% teaching load and the opportunity to work towards a university teaching qualification.
Profile
You hold a Master's or Research Master's degree in Behavioural Science, (Developmental) Psychology or Communication Science.
You have good research, methodological and statistical skills.
You preferably have experience with quantitative research and research methods for mapping digital behaviour (e.g. ESM, data logs, or screenome analysis), or are willing to acquire these skills.
You are familiar with research practices that increase transparency in social science (e.g. pre-registration, data-sharing) or are willing to adopt such an approach.
You have an affinity with young people (10-18-year-olds) as a research group.
You have good social skills and interests to learn and think across disciplines.
You are a team player but also able to work independently.
You have good written and spoken English language skills (required for scientific publishing).

Professor of Architectural and Urban History,"Professor of Architectural and Urban History
Faculteit/Dienst: Faculteit der Geesteswetenschappen
Opleidingsniveau: Gepromoveerd
Functie type: Wetenschappelijk Personeel
Sluitingsdatum: 26 April 2023
Vacaturenummer: 11325
The Faculty of Humanities employs just under 1,000 employees, and approximately 8,000 students study there. The faculty consists of eight departments: Philosophy, Dutch Studies, Media Studies, Art and Cultural Studies, History, European Studies and Religious Studies, Amsterdam Centre for Ancient Studies and Archaeology, Modern Foreign Languages and Cultures, and Literature and Linguistics. Each department is composed of capacity groups, which consist of one or more professors and a number of employees who work in the relevant field.

The Department of Art and Cultural Studies has a vacancy for a full professorship in:

Architectural and Urban History 1,0 FTE (permanent position)

What will you do?

Context of the chair
The Professor of Architectural and Urban History is affiliated with the Amsterdam School of Historical Studies (ASH) and the Arts and Culture department (more specifically the Art History chair group). The basis for the chair is the historical approach of architecture from an art history perspective: this is of fundamental importance in order to ensure the necessary broad Humanities outlook for interdisciplinary research and teaching within and outside the UvA. In addition, the perspective will be broadened to include urban history, with special attention in the research dedicated to the experience of the urban environment; a more international interpretation that does not yet exist in the Netherlands. The new colleague to be appointed will therefore have architectural history experience with an added focus on contemporary urban history and urban design history, as well as the interplay between the built and natural environment, in which environmental history experience (the role of the historical city in its natural environment) is extremely desirable. The focus in this regard will be on a historical perspective that can be linked to modern-day problems of the urban and architectural living environment. This means that expertise in various approaches to the built environment, for example based on experience of the living environment (perception of the environment) will be expected.
The professor will be responsible, in particular, for teaching in the Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Art History, as well as in the Bachelor in Global Arts, Culture and Politics. The professor will play a significant role in both the teaching for the Master’s track Stadsgeschiedenis (Urban History) within the department of History, European Studies and Religious Studies and for various other degree programmes. In addition, the new professor is expected to undertake administrative tasks.

The chair will provide a strong starting point for the aforementioned collaborations within the University, but also with researchers and external institutions, such as Arcam, Het Nieuwe Instituut, the Cultural Heritage Agency, urban authorities and NGOs. The professor is expected to play a leading role in these types of collaborations.

Teaching
The professor will first be responsible for the Architectural History components within the Art History capacity group (capaciteitsgroep Kunstgeschiedenis). Architectural History is one of the four chair groups within the Art History capacity group, in addition to Medieval Art History (Middeleeuwse kunstgeschiedenis), Art History of the Early Modern Period (Kunstgeschiedenis van de nieuwere tijd), and Modern and Contemporary Art History (Moderne en hedendaagse kunstgeschiedenis). Approximately a quarter of the compulsory curriculum of the BA is therefore provided by the Architectural History chair group. In addition to these components, Architectural History also provides three successful BA specialisations, which can also be taken as electives (see also Minor): Ontwerpen voor de moderne stad (Designing for the Modern City); Dit is Amsterdam: identiteit en beeldvorming in kunst en architectuur (This is Amsterdam: identity and perception in art and architecture) and Reparatie en imitatie. Over het gebouwde erfgoed in het ‘eigentijdse’ Amsterdam. Over het gebouwde erfgoed in het 'eigentijdse' Amsterdam. (Repair and imitation. About the built heritage in ‘contemporary Amsterdam).

Secondly, the professor will make an important contribution to the minor Architectuur en Stedenbouw (minor in Architecture and Urban Planning). This is taken annually by approx. 20 students (mostly Human Geography, Urban and Regional Planning, and Geography students, in addition to students from other studies, including English, Economics, Communication Science, Philosophy, Sociology and Anthropology). The minor also provides a basis for the interdisciplinary Master’s track Stadsgeschiedenis (Urban History, department of History, European Studies and Religious Studies: approx. 5 minor students move on to this track annually. Finally, the professor will play an important role in the BA programme Global Arts, Culture and Politics, particularly the major in Sustainability).

Research
The professor will conduct research within the research school Amsterdam School of Historical Studies (ASH). It is important for the research school that the professor’s research ties in with the new methodological and theoretical developments within architectural history that also considers, in addition to the built environment, the urban perception of the environment from a social perspective and sensory experience. An additional expertise in the interplay between the built and natural environment is desirable. The new professor will take a central position within the Centre for Urban History within ASH. This centre has developed into an important pillar within ASH for interdisciplinary research into the history of the city from antiquity to the present day, with approximately 35 staff members from various disciplines. The professor is expected to assume a connecting and guiding role within this centre. In addition, the professor will be responsible for setting up broad interdisciplinary collaborations with researchers within the Faculty of Humanities (FGw) and the University of Amsterdam (UvA), for example with Urban Studies within the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences (FMG), leading to individual or group applications for research financing (ERC, NWO, NWA, etc.). In addition, an international orientation (with corresponding network) is desirable in order to guarantee the leading role of the chair in Amsterdam within a field that is increasingly globally oriented.
The newly appointed professor is further expected to have knowledge of contemporary, innovative and digital research methods, which provide insight into issues about the digital built environment, the digital city (also an important theme within the MA track Urban History) and the living environment, and to collaborate with researchers in Creative Amsterdam: An E-Humanities perspective, and the 4D-Research Lab.

It is expected that the professor to be appointed will be able to enthuse and mentor young researchers; that the professor will have experience in PhD supervision and be able to contribute to creating a safe and stimulating environment for PhD candidates. The professor will also bear responsibility for actively recruiting PhD candidates by means of submitting grant applications in the Netherlands and abroad.

Leadership
The professor to be appointed will preside over the Architectural History chair group with five staff members, which will include two lecturers, a professor by special appointment and two assistant professors, and will have to perform administrative duties at the level of the educational administration (programme director BA of MA), research organisation (e.g. research director of ASH or the national research school for art history) and/or at departmental level (capacity group chair Art History, departmental chair Arts and Culture). Expansion of the administrative capacity is needed within these various levels. Given the desire to create an environment for employees and students that is safe and inclusive, it is of vital importance that the professor to be appointed possesses organisational sensitivity and exercises leadership that is appropriate in this regard.

Your tasks and responsibilities:
teaching Architectural and Urban History, including supervising Bachelor’s and Master’s theses;
contributing to innovation and improvement of the curriculum in the field of Architectural and Urban History;
addressing research themes and projects within the chair group and research groups;
actively pursuing external funding for research, notably funding from research councils, on national as well as European level;
carrying out HR responsibilities within the Architectural History chair group;
carrying out administrative and management tasks within the Department and Faculty.

Successful candidates for the position are expected to meet the following requirements.
You:
hold a PhD in Architectural History or a related academic field;
have an excellent international academic reputation and publication profile, which match the research themes of ASH;
have an affinity with inclusive, polyphonous historical scholarship and digital methods;
are an experienced and engaged teacher at all levels of academic training;

Professor of Contemporary Performing Arts,"University of Groningen
Since its foundation in 1614, the University of Groningen has established an international reputation as a dynamic and innovative university offering high quality teaching and research. Its 37,000 students are encouraged to develop their individual talents through challenging study and career paths. The University of Groningen is an international centre of knowledge: it belongs to the best research universities in Europe, and is allied with prestigious partner universities and networks worldwide. For additional information, see this link: https://www.rug.nl/about-ug/work-with-us/new-staff/. The University of Groningen has a strong commitment to the principles and practices of diversity and inclusion throughout the University community and welcomes candidates who enhance that diversity.

Faculty of Arts
The Faculty of Arts is building on a longstanding tradition of four centuries. Its mission is to be an ambitious top-ranking faculty in terms of both education and high-quality research, with a strong international orientation, firmly rooted in the North of the Netherlands. The faculty creates and shares knowledge through outstanding education and high-quality research, benefitting society.

Arts, Culture and Media
The ACM program is unique in the Netherlands with its doubly interdisciplinary structure: it combines a variety of theoretical and methodological perspectives with a broad range of art disciplines where students choose two art forms in their BA studies from music, theatre, film, literature or the visual arts. This rich interdisciplinary and inter-art setting calls for a scholar with openness to interdisciplinarity. Some of the overarching questions studied by the ACM staff are: How do we define the arts and what are their functions? Which roles do the arts play in the lives of individuals, for specific social groups and within society as a whole? How do related media impact the experiences and evaluation of the arts, and how do contemporary and newly emerging art forms relate to each other and the evolution and history of the arts? How have developments such as intermedial art, participatory art, digital art, performance art, sound art, or new media art transformed the arts in recent years? How do these new and emerging forms of arts deal with questions of climate disaster, post-colonialism, gender inequality? Related to this broad range of questions the new chair should also show commitment to thinking about historical changes in discussions about the arts and share a strong commitment to studying how the arts contribute to societal values and individual worldviews.

The Faculty of Arts in the University of Groningen invites applications for the position of Full Professor of Contemporary Performing Arts (Theatre/Music/Dance). This is a full-time and permanent post.

The successful candidate has an excellent, proven track record in the field of Contemporary Performing Arts, both in research and teaching, and has excellent leadership and mentorship qualities. The new professor comes with a rich and varied experience of working in multidisciplinary teams and is able to work in different fields. The chair holder is expected to lead a dynamic team of researchers with varied research interests and disciplinary backgrounds, and to promote and serve the long-term interests of the team and its members within the Faculty of Arts and beyond.

Research
The research task of the professor covers 40% of the appointment. Research in the field of Arts, Culture and Media (ACM) is housed in the Groningen Research Institute for the Study of Culture (ICOG) and, within this, in the Research Center for Arts in Society with theme groups such as ‘Music, Sound and Culture,’ ‘Film and Contemporary Audiovisual Media,’ and ‘Arts, Culture and Cognition.’ Furthermore, members of the Department of Arts, Culture and Media participate in various national research schools, such as the Research School for Media Studies (RMeS) or the Netherlands Institute of Cultural Analysis (NICA). The new chair will actively contribute to at least one of them. The new professor is expected to secure funding for research projects through research proposals in cooperation with academic or non-academic institutions within and outside the Netherlands. The candidate should therefore have experience in setting up national and international research programmes and obtaining funding. An extensive national and international network is essential.
The new chair will also actively seek PhDs students and explore new ways for joint or double degrees.

Teaching
Teaching covers 60% of the appointment (minus compensated management tasks), and the candidate is expected to teach and lead development of courses at all levels in the department. The ACM department provides education at the Bachelor level in the form of the international BA Arts, Culture and Media, the four minors and pre-master programmes, four MA tracks and two Research Master tracks. The new chair will be teaching in the BA program and in one or more of the four MA tracks in ‘Arts & Culture’: ‘Music, Theatre and Performance Studies’, ‘Arts, Cognition and Criticism’, ‘Arts, Policy and Cultural Entrepreneurship’, and ‘Film and Contemporary Audiovisual Media’, as well as the Research MA ‘Arts & Culture’ with its two tracks ‘Arts, Media and Literary Studies’ and ‘Cultural Leadership.’ Which courses the candidate will be teaching will depend on the profile of the candidate and needs of the program.

Management
The new professor leads the chair group Contemporary Performing Arts (Theatre/Music/Dance) and performs service and administrative tasks within and outside the Faculty of Arts. The new chair holder will play an active role in promoting the regional, national and international prestige of the chair group by initiating and contributing to existing societal and networking activities and will represent the chair group through their contacts with academic institutions and societal partners in the Netherlands and abroad.

PhD position ‘Examining and treating prolonged grief in daily life’,"Key takeaways
Hours
38 hr.
Salary indication
Salary gross/monthly
based on full-time
€ 2,541
Deadline
1 May 2023

Prolonged grief disorder is a debilitating condition, affecting 10% of bereaved people. To date, studies evaluating treatments for prolonged grief have focused on symptom change on a group-level, ignoring individual variability in grief responses.

Personalized prolonged grief treatment may enhance treatment outcomes. An assumption underlying personalized care is that people respond differently to treatment. In part 1 of this project, you will test this assumption by examining distinct trajectories in treatment responses, and correlates thereof, using a novel data-archive. This data-archive consists of existing individual patient data of randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy for prolonged grief disorder (PGD).

Moreover, in order to personalize PGD treatment we need to know to what specific intervention might be helpful for this particular person in what certain moment. A precondition for this personalized treatment approach is that the topic of interest is dynamic and context-dependent. While theoretical and anecdotal work supports that this is the case for PGD, you will be the first to provide an empirical base supporting these claims in part 2 of the project, using experience sampling methodology (ESM). In part 3 of the project, you will create, together with experts and bereaved people, an ESM-based personalized intervention for treatment of PGD using qualitative research methods. In a pilot-study you will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and potential effectiveness of this ESM-based personalized PGD intervention.

As a result of this project, you will contribute in three ways to personalized treatment for prolonged grief, by:

improving the understanding of differences in responses to treatment for prolonged grief;
gaining novel insights in how grief unfolds in daily life;
offering dynamic support in daily life to treat prolonged grief.
You will harmonize and then analyze existing data from randomized controlled trials using latent variable modelling (part 1). Together with master-students you will collect ESM-data (part 2), which you will analyze using multi-level modelling. In close collaboration with scientist-practitioners and bereaved people you will co-create and evaluate a smart-phone app to reduce PGD using qualitative and quantitative research methods (part 3). You will report your findings in academic peer-reviewed journals as well as media outlets for non-academic audiences and you will present your work at (inter)national conferences. Collaborations with national and international colleagues are part of this project. You will be a member of existing research groups that focus on grief and ESM that organize regular meetings to exchange experiences/knowledge in an informal setting with peers.

Your profile
You have a completed master’s degree in psychology or a related field at the preferred start date and you have affinity with clinical psychology and technology
You have experience and affinity with both quantitative and qualitative research methods and analytical thinking is one of your core strengths
You are proactive, have great people skills, and have a 'getting things done' mentality
You have a good team spirit and like to work in an interdisciplinary and internationally oriented environment
You are proficient in English. Possessing good Dutch language skills is an advantage, because study materials are in Dutch
Our offer
A full-time position for four years, with a qualifier in the first year, and the flexibility to work (partially) from home
You will receive a gross monthly salary ranging from € 2.541 (first year) to € 3.247,- (fourth year)
There are excellent benefits including a holiday allowance of 8% of the gross annual salary, an end-of-year bonus of 8.3%, and a solid pension scheme
A minimum of 232 leave hours in case of full-time employment based on a formal workweek of 38 hours. A full-time employment in practice means 40 hours a week, therefore resulting in 96 extra leave hours on an annual basis
Free access to sports facilities on campus
A family-friendly institution that offers parental leave (both paid and unpaid)
You will have a training programme as part of the Twente Graduate School where you and your supervisors will determine a plan for a suitable education and supervision
The University offers a dynamic ecosystem with enthusiastic colleagues
We encourage a high degree of responsibility and independence, but also stimulate interaction and discussion with colleagues

The challenge
The Nyenrode Career & Personal Development (CPD) team plays an important role in the development and growth of our students, working closely with all students of the full- and part-time MBA, MSc in Management and BSc in Business Administration programs on an individual basis and in a variety of mandatory CPD courses. In alignment with Nyenrode’s personal approach, we strive to focus on students’ personal development questions on a more individual basis. Together with students, we work on their personal and career development challenges, to help them understand their strengths and define and articulate their ambitions. We guide students in their job search and in outlining their further career steps after graduation. The department also provides support, expertise, and guidance to Nyenrode alumni. CPD is key in linking students and alumni to the (international) corporate community. Although some structure is needed in each role, CPD provides you the freedom to co-create your own role and develop yourself within a small team.
As Coordinator, Career & Personal Development, you enjoy interaction with current and former students and provide career advice and support, such as providing feedback on CVs and cover letters. Maintenance and continuous improvement of CPD resources and tools, for instance the LinkedIn groups and Nyenrode career platform that are key to our students’ development, will be a key responsibility. Working together with the CPD advisors, you support events such as student-alumni networking sessions and the annual Nyenrode Career Event, some of which may take place on evenings and/or weekends. With the CPD advisors, you are a first point of contact for organizations wishing to reach out to students, and you support the communication between CPD and the corporate community and co-coordinate job postings and content for other publications of CPD materials. The CPD team works with students across different programs, and a role of the Coordinator is to remain in regular contact with diverse groups of colleagues across the university.

Ben je een bruggenbouwer en vind je het belangrijk om de interactie tussen de communicatiewetenschap en communicatiepraktijk te bevorderen? Ben je gespecialiseerd op het gebied van Strategische Communicatie? Wij zoeken momenteel een bijzonder hoogleraar (0.20 fte) voor deze specialisatie.
De bijzondere leerstoel Strategische Communicatie is gevestigd door een vereniging, namelijk Logeion, de Nederlandse beroepsorganisatie van communicatieprofessionals. Logeion vindt het belangrijk dat er een stevige brug is tussen de veelal gescheiden werelden van academisch onderzoek en de praktijkbeoefening op het gebied van strategische communicatie. Logeion beoogt met de bijzondere leerstoel strategische communicatie een inspirerende uitwisseling en productieve wisselwerking tussen de academische- en beroepswereld. De benoeming van een bijzonder hoogleraar past bij het beleid van Logeion om de continue professionalisering van het communicatievak te waarborgen. De leerstoel is ondergebracht bij de Afdeling Communicatiewetenschap van de Universiteit van Amsterdam, in het bijzonder bij de programmagroep Corporate Communicatie.
De programmagroep Corporate Communicatie richt zich op strategische communicatie van organisaties rondom maatschappelijke issues binnen onze (digitale) samenleving en de gevolgen daarvan voor medewerkers, klanten, belangengroepen, overige sociopolitieke en economische actoren en het algemeen publiek.
Binnen de Faculteit Maatschappij en Gedrag biedt de Afdeling Communicatiewetenschap een bachelorprogramma en verschillende masterprogramma’s aan. Het onderzoek is ingebed binnen de Amsterdam School of Communication Research (ASCoR). Het onderwijs in onze bachelor- en masterprogramma’s is interdisciplinair en internationaal georiënteerd. Het bachelorprogramma bevat zowel een Engelstalige als een Nederlandstalige track.
Cursussen in het masterprogramma Corporate Communication zijn o.m. de specialisatieseminars Strategic Communication en Organisations, Media, and Society; en keuzevakken zoals CSR Communication, Climate Change Communication, en Shaping Society: How Organisations and Media Influence Public Issues. In het bachelorprogramma verzorgen we de domeinmodule Corporate Communication, keuzevakken zoals Organisations in the Media en The Language of Strategic Communication, en afstudeerprojecten waarin studenten hun bachelorscriptie schrijven.
De bijzondere leerstoel Strategische Communicatie
