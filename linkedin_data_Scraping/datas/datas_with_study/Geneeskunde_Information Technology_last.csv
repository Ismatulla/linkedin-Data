About ERIKS

80 years ago, ERIKS started as a supplier to the dairy industry in the Netherlands, providing mechanical components and tools that helped dairy plants increase efficiency. Since then, the company kept innovating, evolving, and expanding. Through a consistent focus on technology and service, it became a key sparring partner and service provider for a range of industries. Among its clients are high-tech manufacturing and food companies (such as ASML and Heineken), energy industry players (from windmill operators to power plants), heavy vehicle manufacturers (making cars, ships, or airplanes), construction firms, medicine production businesses, and more.

For these clients, ERIKS provides a wide range of technical products (for instance hoses and valves), co-engineering, customization solutions, and related services. Technical teams are at customers’ beck and call for sophisticated support and advice – from design to smart maintenance. And on the local web shops, customers can easily order tools or component parts.
“We provide products and know–how in a way that has a direct impact on the economy. In each household you’ll find at least one item of which the production was improved with help from ERIKS.” – Floris Jan Cuypers, COO at ERIKS
Dutch DNA, global culture
With its expansion into 17 countries and many different industries, ERIKS became a global organization, with a truly international culture and vision and with talent, experts, and client relationships from everywhere. Meanwhile, its headquarters and roots are in The Netherlands. The company is owned by SHV, a family-owned Dutch group with a portfolio of seven companies that together employ nearly 60.000 people worldwide. The culture at both SHV and ERIKS is built on integrity, entrepreneurship, and a core value of investing in people. With its 6.500 employees and nearly 2 billion Euros revenue, ERIKS is an established corporate – yet one with the entrepreneurial drive and willingness to invest that is often found at younger, smaller, PE-backed businesses.
Digital transformation
ERIKS now finds itself in a very exciting phase: that of a companywide digital transformation. The potential of digital technology for ERIKS extends to all business aspects, from easy business workflows to direct commercial purposes. Digital technology can advance ERIKS e-commerce channels as well as offer new innovations and service propositions that are partially or fully digital. Examples include the proposition of Smart Asset Management (IoT) or ‘ERIKS Wiki’, a knowledge mining database for employees and customers. ERIKS has a dedicated approach to digitization. The company is internally building a proactive, solution-oriented product organisation with top-notch developers and digital and industry experts. Recently, a Chief Digital Officer was hired, and the next three years people, operating model, architecture, governance, and strategy will take full focus.
Eriks Digital is an equal opportunity employer and strives for equal treatment for all genders. Eriks Digital adheres to ethical recruiting methods ensuring that we do not discriminate against any candidate because of age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage or civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, or sexual orientation.
