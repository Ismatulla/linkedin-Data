Rice Curatorial Fellowship in Native American Art,"Introduction

The Art Institute of Chicago shares its singular collections with our city and the world. We collect, care for, and interpret works of art across time, cultures, geographies, and identities, centering the vision of artists and makers. We recognize that all art is made in a particular context, demanding continual, dynamic reconsideration in the present. We are a place of gathering; we foster the exchange of ideas and inspire an expansive, inclusive understanding of human creativity.

Position Summary

The Art of the Americas department stewards a diverse collection of nearly 4,600 objects from North, Central, and South America from 5000 BCE to the present, reflecting the extensive history of artistic production in this hemisphere. Ancient North American bannerstones; a stellar group of nearly 1,200 Moche, Nazca, and other ceramics from the early Andes; representative works of later cultures from Colombia into Panama; and significant objects of Mesoamerican art including an Aztec coronation monument all date prior to the arrival of European colonizers beginning in the late 1400s. Strengths in colonial-era works include a number of 16th-century Andean objects, 18th-century silver and furniture from Boston, Philadelphia, Newport, and New York, and the museum’s historically significant collection of Mexican Talavera Poblana ceramics. The 19th and 20th centuries marked the growing geopolitical and artistic influence of the United States, as represented by the museum’s exceptional holdings of painting, sculpture, and decorative art and design objects. The Art Institute is particularly renowned for iconic paintings by Mary Cassatt, Winslow Homer, Edward Hopper, Archibald Motley, Georgia O’Keeffe, José Clemente Orozco, Diego Rivera, John Singer Sargent, and Grant Wood. A Missouri war shirt, Pueblo ceramics, and numerous California baskets, among other works, show the immense artistic prowess of Native artists during this time. The collection is further enhanced by exemplary silver, distinctive holdings of Tiffany Studios glass, notable folk art, diverse works from the Arts and Crafts movement, and ceramics by Maija Grotell, Maria Martinez, Toshiko Takaezu, and others.
ABOUT THE POSITION
The Arts of the Americas Department at the Art Institute of Chicago seeks a curatorial fellow to act as a thought partner and collaborator in projects engaging Native American art as well as in fostering and supporting relationships with Native American communities.
During the three-year fellowship, the curatorial fellow could expect to collaborate with the department on a major reinstallation of galleries presenting American art from 1600 to 1900, an exhibition of contemporary Native art, convenings that explore Native items stewarded by the museum, and events bringing together Native communities at the museum, as well as caring for, researching, and building relationships over Native items in the museum’s care. The fellow should expect to travel on research trips, to conferences, and to contemporary art fairs. The fellow would also be encouraged to develop or work on their own research project during the fellowship, which the museum would aim to support.
RESPONSIBILITIES
Researching, interpreting, and building relationships over Native American items in the museum’s care.
Collaborating with the other members of the department and across the museum on ongoing reinstallation and exhibition projects involving Native American items.
Fostering and supporting relationships between the museum and members of Native American communities, including artists, leaders, elders, scholars, and students.
Supporting and shaping institutional initiatives related to Native American art and communities.
While the Fellow’s home base will be the department of Arts of the Americas, duties will be performed in collaboration with many other departments at the museum, including Conservation and Science, Exhibitions, Interpretation, Publishing, the Ryan Learning Center, and the Research Center.

Description
The Cleveland Museum of Art (CMA) seeks a highly motivated, experienced curator to oversee the display, interpretation, and growth of the museum’s collections of Indigenous art of the Americas. Applicants should be interested in both the collection of pre-1600 (ancient) Indigenous Mesoamerican, Central, and Southern American art and the collection of ancient to contemporary Native North American art.

In 1920, the CMA became one of the first fine art museums to display the work of Indigenous artists from across the Americas. Pre-1600 artworks from Mesoamerica, the Isthmian Region, and South America’s Central Andes became a strong focus after World War II; the collection today includes approximately 900 objects and textiles that represent most of the major ancient cultures of Central and western South America.

The collection of Indigenous South American art represents the visual creativity of most major cultures in three ancient regions. The earliest works date to circa 1500 B.C.E. and the latest come from the Aztec Empire (Mexica/Tenochca Empire c. 1300-1521) and the Inka Empire (c. 1200-1533). The collection is one of the most refined and comprehensive of its size in the United States and contains many high-caliber objects that have few peers elsewhere. Among a wide range of objects, those made by specialists in clay, stone, fiber, and metals are of primary importance in the collection. Strongest overall are the Mesoamerican holdings from present-day Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize, represented by approximately 320 objects that are particularly strong in the arts of the Classic period, especially Maya works in stone, ceramic, and shell, and Veracruz ballgame sculptures, and Colima ceramics. The Central Andean collection (from modern Peru and its neighbors), comprised of nearly 370 objects, has experienced considerable growth over the past twenty years, notably in its representation of textiles, objects of precious metals, and ceramics. Highlights include a world-famous Nasca painted cloth, along with a group of gold ornaments in the Chavin style, and a rare Chimú litter back-rest. The representation of objects from Central America’s Isthmian Region, numbering over 200 works, was greatly strengthened by the addition of a group of important gold ornaments, primarily from the region now called Colombia as well as Puerto Rico and Panama.

The Native North American collection, comprised of approximately 320 objects, has two primary foci: baskets, made circa 1900, and ancient, modern, and contemporary Southwestern textiles and ceramics made by artists such as Maria Po-Ve-ka Martínez (Tewa, San Ildefonso Pueblo) and Nathan Youngblood (Santa Clara Pueblo). The curator in this area will collaborate with curators of prints and drawings and contemporary art on future acquisitions by modern and contemporary Native American artists.

The museum is seeking candidates who are eager to lead a distinctive program of exhibitions and public programs in alignment with the museum’s strategic plan and priorities. Key responsibilities will also include making new acquisitions; interpreting and presenting the permanent collection; researching and publishing the collection; cultivating donors; and liaising with Indigenous communities, groups, and nations. Candidates should be skilled at building effective relationships across departments and invested in collaboration and teamwork both within and outside of the museum. The ideal candidate will be sensitive to the enhanced public role of museums today, prioritize the strategic goals of the museum, strive to communicate with scholarly and general audiences, and develop narratives that are relevant and inclusive to diverse audiences. The successful candidate will work with members of the museum’s Native North American Advisory Committee which played a key role in drafting the CMA’s Indigenous Peoples and Land Acknowledgment. The successful candidate will also ensure respectful compliance with claims, visits, and resolutions linked to the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). The position is part of the Department of Art of the Americas and Modern and Contemporary Art and reports to the Chair of that Department.

A Master’s Degree in Art History or related field (such as History, Anthropology or Native American/Indigenous Studies) is required; a Ph.D. is preferred. Candidates should have at least five years of relevant museum experience, including experience organizing exhibitions (ideally in a collecting institution)and publishing scholarly research across a breadth of Indigenous American cultures; as well as a proven track record of experience with the ethics of stewarding collections of Indigenous American art. A full range of benefits accompanies the position.

Applications, including a cover letter that addresses the candidate’s interest in the position and the relevance of their experience to the museum’s collection, a curriculum vita, writing sample, and the names and contact information for three references should be submitted by 5/1/2023.


Full-time Benefits include:

Partner level membership to CMA
Free, unlimited admission to select Cleveland Museum of Art ticketed exhibitions (two adult member tickets per visit, subject to availability)
