Researcher Economic Modelling,"Do you want to set up your multi-year research program and develop the next generation of the Ortec Finance economic scenario generator?Do you want to contribute to society, not just by helping improve people’s savings and pensions, but also by researching on cutting edge modelling challenges?If so, keep on reading, for we may be looking for you!What will you do as Researcher Economic Modelling?As a Researcher Economic Modelling within the Scenario & Asset Valuation (SAV) solution, you are responsible for the development of the next generation of the Ortec Finance Economic Scenario Generator (OFS). The current OFS is a global model that integrates short, medium- and long-term investment horizons consistently across all asset classes and economies using our proprietary frequency domain methodology, combined with dynamic factor models. It provides realistic stochastic risk and return scenarios for all relevant time horizons and balance-sheet-level applications in a single calibration, bringing consistency and efficiency to enterprise-wide investment decision-making and risk management. Fueled by the ever-growing demand from our clients and regulators for clear (macro-economic) intuition and assumptions, the next generation OFS must be able to provide more intuition and to integrate climate change, while keeping the OFS’s unique strengths such as scalability and its frequency domain approach.The development of the next generation OFS is a challenging task and requires research for multiple years. In the first year, you get to develop a multi-year research program, containing measurable deliverables and be validated with a few clients. To support the development of this research program, you should lay the necessary fundament in the first year, by understanding the OFS model set-up, the use cases of our clients, and figuring out when clients find the additional intuitiveness of the model sufficient for their purposes. If time allows, a first topic could already be explored in the first year if the research program is ready quickly. Given the applied nature of this research and the focus on generating client-ready innovations, writing publications will not be part of the plan or research goals. When the goals of the first year are achieved, the goal for the second year would be to complete the first major milestone of the research program.You play a crucial role in the quality and fundamental innovation of the OFS for our clients and therefore contribute to the continued long-term success of Ortec Finance.The Scenario & Asset Valuation (SAV) solutionSAV is end-to-end responsible for the innovation, calibration, software, and maintenance of our economic scenario generators and is in direct contact with its clients. The economic scenario generators are available as real-world scenarios for investment and risk management purposes, and as risk-neutral (or arbitrage free) scenarios for valuation purposes. The real-world economic scenario generator is the Ortec Finance Scenario set (OFS) which provides the valuations and risks of various asset classes in the present and future. The OFS creates real-world stochastic scenarios with a worldwide asset class coverage and provides the financial risk and return expectations for more than 600 risk-drivers for a short-, medium- and long-term horizon. The OFS is calibrated and analyzed with our Dynamic Scenario Generator (DSG) software. The risk-neutral economic scenario generator (RN-scenarios) enables actuaries and finance professionals to perform market-consistent valuations of optionality in insurance liabilities and of financial contingent claims more generally. The OFS, DSG and RN-scenarios are a cornerstone in the advisory services Ortec Finance provides to its clients and serves as a crucial input in the financial decision making for applications such as ALM and risk management for pension funds, insurance companies, asset managers, sovereign wealth funds and private wealth management all over the world.

Senior Economic Consultant Scenarios and Asset Valuation,"Would you like to join a dynamic company that provides advisory services to a diverse, international client base comprised of pension funds, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, banks, and asset managers? Are you passionate about simplifying and solving complex problems, while delivering exceptional client service? Are you interested in building your consulting expertise in the exciting fields of economic scenarios and asset valuation? Do you stay up-to-date with global economic developments and financial news? If you answered yes to these questions, we invite you to consider joining us as our Senior Economic Consultant for Scenarios and Asset Valuation.
What do we have to offer?
As a senior economic consultant, our clients see you as their trusted advisor on our scenario-based risk and return expectations and their positioning against the current macroeconomic environment. The quantitative economic scenarios that you will be advising on are a crucial input in the financial decision making for many applications such as ALM, risk management, and financial planning. Example applications include analyzing exposure to which asset classes fits best with investment goals, and whether investment goals are attainable with the current strategic asset allocation.

As a project leader, you are responsible for the management of sales and client servicing projects. Examples are running trials of our scenarios for potential new clients, the onboarding and implementation of new clients, and projects that improve the services that we provide to our global client base, such as rolling out a new stress testing suite. In doing so, you have the opportunity develop yourself technically, economically, and financially, since our quantitative scenarios cover every asset class that typically is part of the portfolios of our global client base.
In your role, you coach other consultants and build relationships with key clients to work on a long-term partnership. This involves personal responsibility for one or more client accounts. You ensure that our clients are satisfied with the products and services that we provide. To do so, you will work closely with other consultants and our quantitative analysts to help our clients understand and use our quantitative economic scenarios as well as the software that our clients use to work with these.

We offer you plenty of room and autonomy to fully apply your talents and highly value an enterprising spirit. You will be given responsibilities immediately and you will be personally and actively mentored in the process.

The Scenarios and Asset Valuation Solution
You will be part of our Scenarios and Asset Valuation (SAV) Solution, which is a group of about 25 persons with an academic background. SAV is an innovative multidisciplinary group with Consultants, Quantitative Financial Analysts, and Quantitative Developers as well as Software Developers.

We provide both real-world and risk-neutral economic scenarios to enable our clients to manage the complexity of investment decision making. Our real-world scenarios provide risk and return projections that dynamically adjust to the latest economic and financial market circumstances. This includes the effects of ‘externalities’ such as central bank interventions or the Covid-19 pandemic and has a global coverage of asset classes for many different regions. We achieve this by integrating characteristics of realistic market behavior (“stylized facts”) into forward-looking asset prices, yield curves, and volatilities as well as into the broader macro-economic environment. Our risk-neutral scenarios enable actuaries and finance professionals to perform market-consistent valuations of optionality in insurance liabilities and of financial contingent claims more generally.
For a flavor of what we do, please refer to our introduction video, quarterly webinars or Insights.
What’s in it for you?
We offer you a challenging and rewarding role in a growing company, while being part of an inspirational global business with a lot of opportunities for personal and professional career development.

The salary range is € 77.000 - € 120.000 on a yearly basis (including variable pay, 13th month, holiday allowance), dependent on your role, competencies, and experience.

In addition to a competitive salary, we offer you excellent benefits, including:
An open and informal work environment (Active staff association, annual ski trip, staff social events, annual summer and Christmas party and much more) with inspiring, smart and enthusiastic colleagues
Opportunities to develop yourself with a training program as well as weekly research and knowledge-sharing meetings

The prospect of a permanent contract, because we strive for a long-term collaboration

Your exceptional social and communication skills enable you to articulate complex matters with ease to clients and senior stakeholders. If this sounds like you, we want you to join our team as Senior Economic Consultant Scenarios and Asset Valuation.

A clear affinity with finance is mandatory, as is an MSc qualification, preferably in Econometrics, (Quantitative) Finance, or Economics
