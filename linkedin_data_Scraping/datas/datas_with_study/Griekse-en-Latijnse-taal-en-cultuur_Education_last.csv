In the normative domain, philosophical work has been dedicated to discussing various conceptions of rationality. We invite projects situated at the interface of these two fields, which raises questions such as: Which conception(s) of rationality are actually at work in empirical studies of cooperation? And which ones would be best suited for understanding cooperation?


The PhD project will be carried out in close collaboration with and will be supervised by dr. Jelle de Boer, dr. Lisa Bastian and prof. dr. Lieven Decock.

Requirements
the candidate has a (preferably Research) Master degree in Philosophy or Economics/Behavioral Science, attained before September 1, 2023
the candidate has a Master degree or a Bachelor degree in Philosophy or in PPE
the candidate has affinity with analytic philosophy, decision/game theory, and empirical studies of cooperation (as shown in grade transcripts, final thesis, and curriculum vitae)
excellent spoken and written English as well as strong academic writing skills are essential
What are we offering?
A challenging position in a socially involved organization. The salary will be in accordance with university regulations for academic personnel and amounts € 2,541 (PhD) per month during the first year and increases to € 3,247 (PhD) per month during the fourth year, based on a full-time employment. The job profile is based on the university job ranking system and is vacant for at least 0.8 FTE.


The appointment will initially be for 1 year. After a satisfactory evaluation of the initial appointment, the contract will be extended for a total duration of 4 years (or 5 years in case of a 0.8 FTE contract).

Professor of Architectural and Urban History,"Professor of Architectural and Urban History
Faculteit/Dienst: Faculteit der Geesteswetenschappen
Opleidingsniveau: Gepromoveerd
Functie type: Wetenschappelijk Personeel
Sluitingsdatum: 26 April 2023
Vacaturenummer: 11325
The Faculty of Humanities employs just under 1,000 employees, and approximately 8,000 students study there. The faculty consists of eight departments: Philosophy, Dutch Studies, Media Studies, Art and Cultural Studies, History, European Studies and Religious Studies, Amsterdam Centre for Ancient Studies and Archaeology, Modern Foreign Languages and Cultures, and Literature and Linguistics. Each department is composed of capacity groups, which consist of one or more professors and a number of employees who work in the relevant field.

The Department of Art and Cultural Studies has a vacancy for a full professorship in:

Architectural and Urban History 1,0 FTE (permanent position)

What will you do?

Context of the chair
The Professor of Architectural and Urban History is affiliated with the Amsterdam School of Historical Studies (ASH) and the Arts and Culture department (more specifically the Art History chair group). The basis for the chair is the historical approach of architecture from an art history perspective: this is of fundamental importance in order to ensure the necessary broad Humanities outlook for interdisciplinary research and teaching within and outside the UvA. In addition, the perspective will be broadened to include urban history, with special attention in the research dedicated to the experience of the urban environment; a more international interpretation that does not yet exist in the Netherlands. The new colleague to be appointed will therefore have architectural history experience with an added focus on contemporary urban history and urban design history, as well as the interplay between the built and natural environment, in which environmental history experience (the role of the historical city in its natural environment) is extremely desirable. The focus in this regard will be on a historical perspective that can be linked to modern-day problems of the urban and architectural living environment. This means that expertise in various approaches to the built environment, for example based on experience of the living environment (perception of the environment) will be expected.
The professor will be responsible, in particular, for teaching in the Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Art History, as well as in the Bachelor in Global Arts, Culture and Politics. The professor will play a significant role in both the teaching for the Master’s track Stadsgeschiedenis (Urban History) within the department of History, European Studies and Religious Studies and for various other degree programmes. In addition, the new professor is expected to undertake administrative tasks.

The chair will provide a strong starting point for the aforementioned collaborations within the University, but also with researchers and external institutions, such as Arcam, Het Nieuwe Instituut, the Cultural Heritage Agency, urban authorities and NGOs. The professor is expected to play a leading role in these types of collaborations.

Teaching
The professor will first be responsible for the Architectural History components within the Art History capacity group (capaciteitsgroep Kunstgeschiedenis). Architectural History is one of the four chair groups within the Art History capacity group, in addition to Medieval Art History (Middeleeuwse kunstgeschiedenis), Art History of the Early Modern Period (Kunstgeschiedenis van de nieuwere tijd), and Modern and Contemporary Art History (Moderne en hedendaagse kunstgeschiedenis). Approximately a quarter of the compulsory curriculum of the BA is therefore provided by the Architectural History chair group. In addition to these components, Architectural History also provides three successful BA specialisations, which can also be taken as electives (see also Minor): Ontwerpen voor de moderne stad (Designing for the Modern City); Dit is Amsterdam: identiteit en beeldvorming in kunst en architectuur (This is Amsterdam: identity and perception in art and architecture) and Reparatie en imitatie. Over het gebouwde erfgoed in het ‘eigentijdse’ Amsterdam. Over het gebouwde erfgoed in het 'eigentijdse' Amsterdam. (Repair and imitation. About the built heritage in ‘contemporary Amsterdam).

Secondly, the professor will make an important contribution to the minor Architectuur en Stedenbouw (minor in Architecture and Urban Planning). This is taken annually by approx. 20 students (mostly Human Geography, Urban and Regional Planning, and Geography students, in addition to students from other studies, including English, Economics, Communication Science, Philosophy, Sociology and Anthropology). The minor also provides a basis for the interdisciplinary Master’s track Stadsgeschiedenis (Urban History, department of History, European Studies and Religious Studies: approx. 5 minor students move on to this track annually. Finally, the professor will play an important role in the BA programme Global Arts, Culture and Politics, particularly the major in Sustainability).

Research
The professor will conduct research within the research school Amsterdam School of Historical Studies (ASH). It is important for the research school that the professor’s research ties in with the new methodological and theoretical developments within architectural history that also considers, in addition to the built environment, the urban perception of the environment from a social perspective and sensory experience. An additional expertise in the interplay between the built and natural environment is desirable. The new professor will take a central position within the Centre for Urban History within ASH. This centre has developed into an important pillar within ASH for interdisciplinary research into the history of the city from antiquity to the present day, with approximately 35 staff members from various disciplines. The professor is expected to assume a connecting and guiding role within this centre. In addition, the professor will be responsible for setting up broad interdisciplinary collaborations with researchers within the Faculty of Humanities (FGw) and the University of Amsterdam (UvA), for example with Urban Studies within the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences (FMG), leading to individual or group applications for research financing (ERC, NWO, NWA, etc.). In addition, an international orientation (with corresponding network) is desirable in order to guarantee the leading role of the chair in Amsterdam within a field that is increasingly globally oriented.
The newly appointed professor is further expected to have knowledge of contemporary, innovative and digital research methods, which provide insight into issues about the digital built environment, the digital city (also an important theme within the MA track Urban History) and the living environment, and to collaborate with researchers in Creative Amsterdam: An E-Humanities perspective, and the 4D-Research Lab.

It is expected that the professor to be appointed will be able to enthuse and mentor young researchers; that the professor will have experience in PhD supervision and be able to contribute to creating a safe and stimulating environment for PhD candidates. The professor will also bear responsibility for actively recruiting PhD candidates by means of submitting grant applications in the Netherlands and abroad.

Leadership
The professor to be appointed will preside over the Architectural History chair group with five staff members, which will include two lecturers, a professor by special appointment and two assistant professors, and will have to perform administrative duties at the level of the educational administration (programme director BA of MA), research organisation (e.g. research director of ASH or the national research school for art history) and/or at departmental level (capacity group chair Art History, departmental chair Arts and Culture). Expansion of the administrative capacity is needed within these various levels. Given the desire to create an environment for employees and students that is safe and inclusive, it is of vital importance that the professor to be appointed possesses organisational sensitivity and exercises leadership that is appropriate in this regard.

Your tasks and responsibilities:
teaching Architectural and Urban History, including supervising Bachelor’s and Master’s theses;
contributing to innovation and improvement of the curriculum in the field of Architectural and Urban History;
addressing research themes and projects within the chair group and research groups;
actively pursuing external funding for research, notably funding from research councils, on national as well as European level;
carrying out HR responsibilities within the Architectural History chair group;
carrying out administrative and management tasks within the Department and Faculty.

You:
hold a PhD in Architectural History or a related academic field;
have an excellent international academic reputation and publication profile, which match the research themes of ASH;
have an affinity with inclusive, polyphonous historical scholarship and digital methods;
are an experienced and engaged teacher at all levels of academic training;
have expertise in developing and renewing teaching programmes at Bachelor’s and Master’s levels;
can show a track record of applying for/acquiring external research funding;

The Faculty of Law, Institute for Information Law (IViR), and the University Research Priority Area on Trust in the Digital Society (TRUST RPA: https://www.ivir.nl/trust-in-the-digital-society-new-uva-research-priority-area/ ) is looking for a postdoctoral researcher to study the institutional safeguards of trustworthy centralized and decentralized techno-social infrastructures.

The TRUST RPA is a five year long interdisciplinary research initiative to study how we trust is changing due to the emergence of new trust production technologies, and the disruption of existing trust relations.

The digital society relies on an ever-expanding network of digital infrastructures. This forces us to rethink some of our basic assumptions about one of the most fundamental resources in all interpersonal, social, economic relations: trust.
Despite their widespread use, we know little about the trustworthiness of our digital infrastructures. At best it is difficult to establish their trustworthiness (such as with AI), at worst they are proven to be untrustworthy (as is the case with social media).
Some of these digital infrastructures play key roles in interpersonal and societal trust dynamics. They disrupt existing trust relations and offer new ways to trust each other.
Our scientific methods and theories face serious limits when it comes to the study of change of social structures, institutions, and processes under the conditions of rapid technological transformation. Research on trust in technology and trust by technology is siloed, and focuses on narrowly defined technologies (AI), or problems (system security), and lacks a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, long-term-view.

This postdoctoral position (embedded in the TRUST RPA, supervised by both the Institute for Information Law, at the Amsterdam Law School, and at least one other participating faculty) will use empirical research to study how various new technological infrastructures disrupt or can enhance existing societal (impersonal, institutional) trust relations and strive to establish new forms of trust relations in society.

What are you going to do?

 The successful candidate will:
Conduct empirical, qualitative research (interviews, case studies, discourse analysis) on the dynamics of institutional, impersonal trust with regards to emerging digital technologies, such as digital platforms, web3 technologies, or Machine Learning based automated systems.
Coordinate the development, fieldwork and initial analysis of a large-scale longitudinal survey
Conduct work on the emerging European technology regulation framework (Digital Services Act, AI Act, Digital Markets Act) using doctrinal research, normative research and discourse analysis
Organize events, conferences
Participate in grant proposal development, international network building
Acquiree funding

The Postdoctoral researcher will be hired by the Faculty of Law, closely collaborating with two other postdoctoral researchers in the Trust RPA. The team will be supervised by the PIs of the TRUS RPA: Balazs Bodo, Associate Professor at the Institute of Information Law (IViR) at the Faculty of Law, Jan B. Engelmann, Professor of Neuroeconomics at the Amsterdam School of Economics, Theo Araujo, Associate Professor Communication in the Digital Society at the Amsterdam School of Communication Research (ASCoR), Tom van Engers, Professor in Legal Knowledge Management at the University of Amsterdam, and Marc Tuters, Assistant Professor in the New Media and Digital Culture Division of Media Studies at the Faculty of Humanities.

What do we require of you?

 The successful candidate has:
a PhD degree in law, or social sciences (sociology, economics, political science, communication science, science and technology studies or related fields)
strong empirical research skills;
familiarity with qualitative research methods,
familiarity with doctrinal research or policy research;
good knowledge of current developments in information markets and technology;
academic excellence, as shown in the grade transcripts and curriculum vitae.
a creative mind and analytical intelligence;
an interest in working in a multidisciplinary team;
willingness to learn new knowledge, and acquire new skills required by the project;
excellent written and spoken command of English, and ideally knowledge of Dutch
interest in working on interdisciplinary topics, in interdisciplinary teams.

Candidates, who have:
quantitative skills, including survey development, statistical analysis, and/or
familiarity with R, python or any other programming language, and/or
big data collection and analysis skills, and/or
previous experience in the private or public sector

will be given extra consideration in the application process.

We strongly encourage members of broadly understood minority socio-cultural groups to apply. We believe that there are several traditionally underrepresented, but incredibly forceful perspectives, that have transformed our respective disciplines. Recent scholarship by persons of colour, feminist, intersectionalist scholars, scholars from the Global South have highlighted fundamental issues with the design, operation, and impact of techno-social systems that remained in the blind spots of mainstream scholarship. Without such contributions, serious problems, such as racial bias in AI systems, would have gone unnoticed and left unaddressed by more careful technical design and better regulation.

Our offer

We offer a temporary employment contract for 38 hours per week for a period of 36 months with a probationary period of two months. The preferred starting date is as soon possible.
The gross monthly salary, based on 30,4 -38 (0.8-1 FTE) hours per week and dependent on relevant experience, ranges between € 2,960 to € 4,670 (scale 10). UvA additionally offers an extensive package of secondary benefits, including 8% holiday allowance and a year-end bonus of 8.3%. The UFO profile Researcher 4 is applicable. A favourable tax agreement, the ‘30% ruling’, may apply to non-Dutch applicants. The Collective Labour Agreement of Universities of the Netherlands is applicable.

Besides the salary and a vibrant and challenging environment we offer you multiple fringe benefits:
232 holiday hours per year (based on fulltime) and extra holidays between Christmas and 1 January;
Multiple courses to follow from our Teaching and Learning Centre;
Multiple courses on topics such as leadership for academic staff;

7 weeks birth leave (partner leave) with 100% salary;
Partly paid parental leave;
The possibility to set up a workplace at home;
A pension at ABP for which UvA pays two third part of the contribution;
The possibility to follow courses to learn Dutch;

What else do we offer
the possibility to start up and grow a New Research priority Area at the UvA,
close working relations with five faculties of the UvA; and with TU Delft, and Erasmus University, Rotterdam
freedom to develop your own research agenda;
welcoming, international, dynamic teams;
an inspiring academic and professional environment in the heart of Amsterdam;
excellent possibilities for further professional development and education.

The Context

The Computer Science department of the University of Twente is expanding. Therefore, we are hiring 6 new faculty members, to strengthen our research in Artificial Intelligence, Cyberphysical systems and Software Engineering in the domains of (1) e-Health and (2) energy and sustainability. These new faculty members will be assigned in different research groups, but inter-group collaboration with other researchers working on these themes is considered essential to reach our overall ambitions. One of the six positions is in the Formal Methods and Tools group (FMT) and focusses on research in energy and sustainability.


The Position

The Formal Methods and Tools group develops and implements mathematical methods, high-performance data structures and algorithms, and suitable programming languages for the design of reliable software- and data-intensive control systems. One important aspect that we would like to consider more prominently in our work is the energy consumption of such systems. Therefore, we are looking for somebody with expertise on energy-efficient software development. Areas that we are interested in are for example the modelling of energy usage of software (possibly considering different hardware models for execution), techniques to estimate the energy consumption of software, and techniques that can be used to (automatically) reduce the energy consumption of software. We are interested in integrating such techniques in many of the techniques that we develop within FMT. We also are interested in collaborating with the other groups within the CS department on this topic.


The Formal Methods and Tools group is an internationally well-known group of researchers in the area of formal methods and software engineering. Their research covers a wide range of different tools and techniques. The group is quickly growing: it currently consists of 4 full-time full professors, 2 associate professors and 8 assistant professors. In addition, several part-time full professors are associated to the group. The FMT group has an open and welcoming atmosphere, where there is room for both scientific and social interactions.

Your profile
You have a strong interest and have shown ability to collaborate in an academic, multidisciplinary environment;
You have a PhD degree in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or related discipline;
You have demonstrated the ability to perform high-quality research in a field relevant to the theme of energy and sustainability and to research done in the FMT group;
You have shown a willingness to acquire external funding and are prepared to expand your skills in this respect;
You have good communication skills and are a team player;
You are fluent in English (knowledge of, or willingness to learn Dutch is an advantage);
You have a University Teaching Qualification (Dutch: BKO) or equivalent, or you are willing to acquire one within three years.
Our offer
We offer a permanent position with a one-year probationary period (formally a 1-year contract with prospect of permanent contract).
The position comes with a start-up package that will be allow you to appoint one PhD student.
Our terms of employment are in accordance with the Dutch Collective Labor Agreement for Universities (CAO) and include a holiday allowance of 8% of the gross annual salary and a year-end bonus of 8.3%.
Depending on your relevant background and experience, the gross monthly salary on a full-time basis ranges from € 3974,- (scale 11) to € 7362,- (scale 14) gross per month.
A minimum of 29 leave days in case of full-time employment based on a formal workweek of 38 hours. A fulltime employment in practice means 40 hours a week, therefore resulting in 96 extra leave hours on an annual basis.
A solid pension scheme.
Free access to sport facilities on campus.
We are a family-friendly institution, which offers parental leave for both parents (both paid and unpaid) and career support for partners.
We appreciate diversity of profiles, cultures, and backgrounds, and promote an inclusive working culture.

Are you interested in studying networks and using methodology at the cross-section of business analytics, econometrics and computer science? The Business Analytics section at the University of Amsterdam Business School invites applications for a PhD position in Network Statistics and Machine Learning. We are looking for candidates with the ambition to work and succeed at the highest international academic level.

The main topic of research is network analysis and modelling using statistical and machine learning tools. Network data are ubiquitous in finance, social media, the economy, and business. Social networks play an increasingly important role in society. For example, the Reddit community WallStreetBets hyped the stock of GameStop (GME), causing a short squeeze and extremely volatile stock prices in early 2021. Similarly, statements made on social networks such as Twitter have been shown to impact public and voter opinions. Exemplifying how social networks directly affect the economy, this project focusses on studying network data with a specific interest in modelling and understanding how networks change over time. Change detection in an online fashion is a challenging task in networks of large size, a common property of social networks.

In this research, the candidate will first investigate and develop interpretable network analysis approaches using statistical models and test them on real-life data. Then geometric deep learning approaches for the tasks like node classification, link prediction and graph classification will be developed with change detection ability. In the final phase of the project, the candidate should bring together two families of methods and design an optimized algorithm that is both interpretable and yields a high performance in network change detection.

The PhD student will work in close collaboration with the supervisory team and other faculty on the tasks.
The supervisory team will consist of dr. Inez Zwetsloot (ABS), dr. Simon Trimborn (ASE) and dr. Stevan Rudinac (ABS).

What are you going to do?

Develop novel interpretable statistical models for network analysis;
develop novel deep-learning approaches for node classification, link prediction, and community detection in network data;
create open data and software tools for the envisioned network analysis tasks;
present research findings at international conferences;
write up findings for publication in international journals;

The Context

The Computer Science department of the University of Twente is expanding. Therefore, we are hiring 6 new faculty members, to strengthen our research in Artificial Intelligence, Cyberphysical systems and Software Engineering in the domains of (1) e-Health and (2) energy and sustainability. These new faculty members will be assigned in different research groups, but inter-group collaboration with other researchers working on these themes is considered essential to reach our overall ambitions. One of the six positions is in the Human Media Interaction (HMI) group and focusses on research in e-Health.


The Position

Research into multimodal conversational systems such as chatbots, virtual humans, or social robots to coach people to live a healthier lifestyle, both from a physical and mental perspective, has seen a steady growth in the past couple of years. With the introduction of conversational systems such as ChatGPT and Bard, it looks as if smooth natural language conversations with an AI system have become possible. However, lifestyle coaching systems need a more sensitive and controlled mechanism to decide on what personalized advice to give. They need to be sensitive to the possibly vulnerable physical and mental state of the user and be aware of the possible effects of their advice. Furthermore, the information they provide should be communicated in a convincing way, but also be reliable and trustworthy. We are looking for a candidate with an AI background that can contribute to intelligent systems that can realise these goals.

Human Media Interaction (HMI) is a diverse and interdisciplinary research group that studies and designs interactive systems that users can intuitively interact with, ranging from Brain Computer Interfaces to Conversational Systems and Ambient Intelligence applications. In the area of Conversational Systems, HMI has expertise on speech technology, dialogue systems, embodied conversational agents and social robots. On the theme of e-Health, HMI has a strong tradition in contributing to a variety of coaching systems such as applications to increase physical fitness, advice on particular conditions (asthma, diabetes), or helping people to stop smoking or drinking. Research is conducted in coalitions with other research groups from inside and outside the University of Twente and with external stakeholders such as hospitals, rehabilitation centers, elderly homes, etcetera.

The Faculty of Humanities at Leiden University invites applications for a fulltime PhD position in Buddhist Studies. The PhD candidate will carry out research in the framework of the European Research Council (ERC) funded project ""Locating Literature, Lived Religion, and Lives in the Himalayas: The Van Manen Collection"" led by dr. Berthe Jansen. This project offers a study of an important collection of Himalayan texts and artifacts collected between 1920 and 1940 in Kalimpong and Tibet. It aims to provide a view of the Van Manen collection through a study of its rare manuscripts, the material objects, undocumented marginal writings, and the unique Tibetan language autobiographies by ordinary Himalayan people commissioned by Van Manen.

The project's goal is the examination of the van Manen Collection as a whole using historical, ethnographic and philological methods, and by employing Digital Humanities methods through which the origins of the texts and artifacts can be traced, mapped, and be made available, linking them to other editions in online databases as well as to local Tibetan archives. The main aim is to get an understanding of the proliferation, usage, and presence of religious and ritual literature and artifacts in the greater Darjeeling area in the first half of the 20th century and, by extension, their religious milieus.
The PhD candidate will work mainly with the rare and unusual Tibetan language manuscripts in the collection. S/he will make an inventory of the manuscripts that are either rare or unique and try to trace the geographical and textual origins of these manuscripts with the help of the PI. This will be done through 1) an examination of the ephemera that discuss the methods Van Manen’s assistants used to collect manuscripts 2) fieldwork: interviewing households that still own similar manuscripts in the greater Kalimpong area to retrieve information on the context of these ritual texts, and 3) locating similar manuscripts in existing databases such as that of the BDRC. Under the guidance of the PI, the PhD candidate will select particularly important Tibetan language texts, analyze, contextualize, and (as appropriate) translate them.

The PhD candidate will be based in Leiden where s/he will join a research team that will consist of four members: one PhD candidate, two post-doctoral researchers, and the project leader. S/he will participate in regular teammeetings and present his/her research findings at scholarly venues, as well as in field trips to India.
Requirements
An MA degree in Buddhist Studies, Tibetan Studies, Religious Studies or comparable. Candidates near completion of the degree will be considered
Excellent command of written Tibetan, both classical and modern
Fluency in spoken and written English
Broad knowledge of Tibetan religious and cultural history
Knowledge of (or willingness to learn) spoken Tibetan, Nepalese or Lepcha will be considered an asset
Some experience in working with Tibetan religious texts
Demonstrable interest in manuscript culture and literary production in culturally Tibetan regions
Willingness to work in an international research environment
Willingness to spend a limited amount of time teaching in the 2nd and 3rd year of the 4-year PhD trajectory
Willingness to help organize the yearly workshops
Ability to work independently and as part of and in support of a larger team

"Postdoc position in Digital Humanities, ERC StG/NWO Vidi Project ""Exiled Empiricists""","Tilburg University | Tilburg School of Humanities and Digital Sciences Postdoc position in Digital Humanities, ERC StG/NWO Vidi Project “Exiled Empiricists”

Department : Department of Philosophy
Location : Tilburg
Full time equivalent : 0,8 – 1,0 fte (32-40 hours per week)
Monthly full-time salary : € 2.960 - € 4.670
Duration of employment contract : 2 years (based on 1,0 fte)
The Department of Philosophy at Tilburg University seeks to appoint a postdoctoral researcher (2-3 years, 0.8-1,0 fte) in the ERC StG/NWO Vidi project “Exiled Empiricists: American Philosophy and the Great Intellectual Migration”. Starting date: September or October 2023.

Job description
The postdoc’s primary responsibility will be to contribute to a quantitative study of the development of American philosophy in the decades before and after World War II (working packages A1-A3 of the ERC research project, description below) and to publish in peer reviewed journals and books. The researcher should also contribute to the project in other ways, such as by giving conference presentations, (co-)editing a special issue, and (co-)organizing reading groups and workshops. Furthermore, the researcher will be a member of the Tilburg Center for Moral Philosophy, Epistemology and Philosophy of Science (TiLPS) and contribute to its colloquia and seminars. You will be working in a stimulating and dynamic interdisciplinary research environment. You will work in close collaboration with the project’s principal investigator and have regular team meetings with the other members of the group.

The project
Exiled Empiricists: American Philosophy and the Great Intellectual Migration
The Exiled Empiricists project is funded by the European Research Council (ERC) and the Dutch Research Council (NWO) and led by Sander Verhaegh within the Tilburg Center for Moral Philosophy, Epistemology and Philosophy of Science (TiLPS), Tilburg University. The project currently employs three postdocs, a research assistant, and an external Ph.D. member.

Summary: In the 1930s, hundreds of European academics fled to the United States, escaping the quickly deteriorating political situation on the continent. Among them were a few dozen philosophers from a variety of schools: logical empiricists, critical theorists, and phenomenologists. Especially the first group would have a tremendous impact on American philosophy. Whereas the local intellectual climate had been dictated by American traditions like pragmatism, U.S. philosophers soon began to advance views that were heavily indebted to the empiricists. In fact, much of academic philosophy today is still shaped by the discussions and practices first instigated in this disruptive period.

Although historians have reconstructed the fate of the exiled empiricists, little attention has been paid to the American context in which their movement came to full bloom. This is surprising, since any account of the empiricists’ success requires an explanation of why the Americans were so receptive to their views. To what extent did developments in American philosophy pave the way for logical empiricism? And why was the American community more receptive to empiricism than to critical theory or phenomenology? This project shifts the perspective from the refugees to the local philosophical climate by 1) quantitatively analyzing thousands of American journal publications and 2) qualitatively examining the archives of dozens of key American philosophers and institutions.

A more detailed description of the project, including the working packages A1-A3 (to which the postdoctoral researcher will contribute), can be found on the project website.

Requirements position
We are looking for a postdoctoral researcher who satisfies the following requirements:
A completed PhD in philosophy, computer science, history, computational linguistics or a related field.
Demonstrable knowledge of bibliometric methods such as topic modeling, citation analysis, and named entity recognition.
Solid programming skills in Python and optionally other programming languages (R is an asset).
A strong, promising track-record of international peer-reviewed publications
Affinity with the topic of the project
C1-level speaking and writing skills in English.
Knowledge of web development and/or databases is an advantage but not a requirement
Familiarity with network analysis/visualization software (e.g., Gephi, Pajek, VOSviewer) is an advantage but not a requirement.
Demonstrable research experience in philosophy, HPS, STS, intellectual history, or a related field in humanities is an advantage but not a requirement.

You will join a diverse team of researchers based at multiple universities in the Netherlands and be in contact with industrial stakeholders to develop conversational agents. Together, the project partners will develop, implement and evaluate safe and transparent chat-based conversational AI agents based on state-of-the-art neural architectures. In particular, in this PhD project (PhD9) you will develop new methods for preventing the generation of unsafe utterances by conversational agents, with the goal of ensuring that the system’s behaviour does not result in the reinforcement of negative stereotypes or in users feeling excluded. We plan to approach the problem from three related angles: (i) detection: creation of a typology of safety issues relevant to particular stakeholders and detection of potentially unsafe content; (ii) interpretability: developing and applying explainability techniques to identify the causes that led to generating problematic utterances; and (ii) controlled text generation: developing and applying methods to steer utterance generation or retrieval away from unsafe content.

Tasks and responsibilities:
complete and defend a PhD thesis within the official appointment duration of four years;
regularly present research results at international workshops and conferences, and to publish them in conference proceedings and journals;
participate in and contribute to the organisation of research activities and events at the ILLC, such as workshops and colloquia;
make a small contribution to the ILLC’s educational mission, by working as a teaching assistant for courses in your area of expertise and by assisting with the supervision of student research projects.
What do you have to offer?

Your experience and profile:
A Master’s degree in a relevant discipline, such as computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, or computer science.
An excellent academic track record.
A serious interest in pursuing fundamental research on NLP for positive impact.
Good programming skills and experience with deep learning methods for NLP, ideally including experience with dialogue, language generation and/or interpretability techniques.
Good writing and presentation skills.
Good social and organisational skills.
Full professional proficiency in spoken and written English.
Please note that knowledge of the Dutch language could be useful but is not required for this position, nor is Dutch language required for being able to live in Amsterdam. However, if you wish, as a PhD candidate at the ILLC you will have the opportunity to attend Dutch language classes.

Our offer

A temporary contract for 38 hours per week for the duration of 4 years (the initial contract will be for a period of 18 months and after satisfactory evaluation it will be extended for a total duration of 4 years). The preferred starting date is as soon as possible and no later than the 1st of September 2023. This should lead to a dissertation (PhD thesis).
