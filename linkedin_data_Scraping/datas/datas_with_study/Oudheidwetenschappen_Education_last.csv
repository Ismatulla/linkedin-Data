Professor of Architectural and Urban History,"Professor of Architectural and Urban History
Faculteit/Dienst: Faculteit der Geesteswetenschappen
Opleidingsniveau: Gepromoveerd
Functie type: Wetenschappelijk Personeel
Sluitingsdatum: 26 April 2023
Vacaturenummer: 11325
The Faculty of Humanities employs just under 1,000 employees, and approximately 8,000 students study there. The faculty consists of eight departments: Philosophy, Dutch Studies, Media Studies, Art and Cultural Studies, History, European Studies and Religious Studies, Amsterdam Centre for Ancient Studies and Archaeology, Modern Foreign Languages and Cultures, and Literature and Linguistics. Each department is composed of capacity groups, which consist of one or more professors and a number of employees who work in the relevant field.

The Department of Art and Cultural Studies has a vacancy for a full professorship in:

Architectural and Urban History 1,0 FTE (permanent position)

What will you do?

Context of the chair
The Professor of Architectural and Urban History is affiliated with the Amsterdam School of Historical Studies (ASH) and the Arts and Culture department (more specifically the Art History chair group). The basis for the chair is the historical approach of architecture from an art history perspective: this is of fundamental importance in order to ensure the necessary broad Humanities outlook for interdisciplinary research and teaching within and outside the UvA. In addition, the perspective will be broadened to include urban history, with special attention in the research dedicated to the experience of the urban environment; a more international interpretation that does not yet exist in the Netherlands. The new colleague to be appointed will therefore have architectural history experience with an added focus on contemporary urban history and urban design history, as well as the interplay between the built and natural environment, in which environmental history experience (the role of the historical city in its natural environment) is extremely desirable. The focus in this regard will be on a historical perspective that can be linked to modern-day problems of the urban and architectural living environment. This means that expertise in various approaches to the built environment, for example based on experience of the living environment (perception of the environment) will be expected.
The professor will be responsible, in particular, for teaching in the Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Art History, as well as in the Bachelor in Global Arts, Culture and Politics. The professor will play a significant role in both the teaching for the Master’s track Stadsgeschiedenis (Urban History) within the department of History, European Studies and Religious Studies and for various other degree programmes. In addition, the new professor is expected to undertake administrative tasks.

The chair will provide a strong starting point for the aforementioned collaborations within the University, but also with researchers and external institutions, such as Arcam, Het Nieuwe Instituut, the Cultural Heritage Agency, urban authorities and NGOs. The professor is expected to play a leading role in these types of collaborations.

Teaching
The professor will first be responsible for the Architectural History components within the Art History capacity group (capaciteitsgroep Kunstgeschiedenis). Architectural History is one of the four chair groups within the Art History capacity group, in addition to Medieval Art History (Middeleeuwse kunstgeschiedenis), Art History of the Early Modern Period (Kunstgeschiedenis van de nieuwere tijd), and Modern and Contemporary Art History (Moderne en hedendaagse kunstgeschiedenis). Approximately a quarter of the compulsory curriculum of the BA is therefore provided by the Architectural History chair group. In addition to these components, Architectural History also provides three successful BA specialisations, which can also be taken as electives (see also Minor): Ontwerpen voor de moderne stad (Designing for the Modern City); Dit is Amsterdam: identiteit en beeldvorming in kunst en architectuur (This is Amsterdam: identity and perception in art and architecture) and Reparatie en imitatie. Over het gebouwde erfgoed in het ‘eigentijdse’ Amsterdam. Over het gebouwde erfgoed in het 'eigentijdse' Amsterdam. (Repair and imitation. About the built heritage in ‘contemporary Amsterdam).

Secondly, the professor will make an important contribution to the minor Architectuur en Stedenbouw (minor in Architecture and Urban Planning). This is taken annually by approx. 20 students (mostly Human Geography, Urban and Regional Planning, and Geography students, in addition to students from other studies, including English, Economics, Communication Science, Philosophy, Sociology and Anthropology). The minor also provides a basis for the interdisciplinary Master’s track Stadsgeschiedenis (Urban History, department of History, European Studies and Religious Studies: approx. 5 minor students move on to this track annually. Finally, the professor will play an important role in the BA programme Global Arts, Culture and Politics, particularly the major in Sustainability).

Research
The professor will conduct research within the research school Amsterdam School of Historical Studies (ASH). It is important for the research school that the professor’s research ties in with the new methodological and theoretical developments within architectural history that also considers, in addition to the built environment, the urban perception of the environment from a social perspective and sensory experience. An additional expertise in the interplay between the built and natural environment is desirable. The new professor will take a central position within the Centre for Urban History within ASH. This centre has developed into an important pillar within ASH for interdisciplinary research into the history of the city from antiquity to the present day, with approximately 35 staff members from various disciplines. The professor is expected to assume a connecting and guiding role within this centre. In addition, the professor will be responsible for setting up broad interdisciplinary collaborations with researchers within the Faculty of Humanities (FGw) and the University of Amsterdam (UvA), for example with Urban Studies within the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences (FMG), leading to individual or group applications for research financing (ERC, NWO, NWA, etc.). In addition, an international orientation (with corresponding network) is desirable in order to guarantee the leading role of the chair in Amsterdam within a field that is increasingly globally oriented.
The newly appointed professor is further expected to have knowledge of contemporary, innovative and digital research methods, which provide insight into issues about the digital built environment, the digital city (also an important theme within the MA track Urban History) and the living environment, and to collaborate with researchers in Creative Amsterdam: An E-Humanities perspective, and the 4D-Research Lab.

It is expected that the professor to be appointed will be able to enthuse and mentor young researchers; that the professor will have experience in PhD supervision and be able to contribute to creating a safe and stimulating environment for PhD candidates. The professor will also bear responsibility for actively recruiting PhD candidates by means of submitting grant applications in the Netherlands and abroad.

Leadership
The professor to be appointed will preside over the Architectural History chair group with five staff members, which will include two lecturers, a professor by special appointment and two assistant professors, and will have to perform administrative duties at the level of the educational administration (programme director BA of MA), research organisation (e.g. research director of ASH or the national research school for art history) and/or at departmental level (capacity group chair Art History, departmental chair Arts and Culture). Expansion of the administrative capacity is needed within these various levels. Given the desire to create an environment for employees and students that is safe and inclusive, it is of vital importance that the professor to be appointed possesses organisational sensitivity and exercises leadership that is appropriate in this regard.
