IT Business Consultancy Traineeship (The Netherlands),"——– For NL only ———
Get to discover different customer organizations bringing in their own business IT challenges on the ServiceNow platform during our 2-year IT Business Consultancy Traineeship. Fulfill several roles in the IT business consultancy world to explore what you like and what fits best with your ambitions and skills.
Nowadays, every company relies on technology. No matter what product or service it provides. Therefore, companies continuously invest in digital transformation. But many fail to achieve its true benefits. Learn how to help these companies achieve greater value from their (digital) transformation on the ServiceNow platform by solving complex technical problems with a simple solution. We see more multinationals replacing outdated technology and digital workplace tools with ServiceNow because it’s the latest and greatest. The main reason we’re a pure-play ServiceNow implementation partner.
What will you do?
You get to choose between two IT Business Consultancy Traineeship programs:

Consultancy Program
Every 1st day of the month, starting September 1, 2022
In the Consultancy Program you become part of one of our existing customer delivery teams. Together with the team, you deliver IT solutions for different customers (like Heineken, ASML and IKEA) to make their work flow. You get to deliver workshops, analyze as-is business situations, define and develop solutions, and train customer end users.
After two years you’ve had a look behind the scenes at quite some organizations and fulfilled or participated in different IT roles like Consultant, Tester, Trainer, Project Manager and Architect. You finish this program with an assignment based on your strengths and interest, like presales, coaching new trainees, managing a small project or internal training.
This traineeship kick-starts your career to become an IT Project Manager, Team Leader, Consultant or Success Advisor in the world of ServiceNow and beyond.

Client Based Program
Start September 1, 2022 (next group starts in 2023)
In the Client Based Program, you’ll form one team with like-minded, driven trainees all starting on September 1st. Together, you explore and join 2 different customer organizations varying in size, culture, and industry. Each of them with their own unique IT tech challenges. This way, you get to learn how organizations operate and see if IT Business Consultancy is a good fit for you. After this traineeship, you’ll know better how to develop yourself further based on your newly gained experiences and knowledge.
After two years, you’ll have seen how organizations, like Heineken, Philips, ASML and Aegon, work and fulfilled or participated in different business IT roles, like Consultant, Tester, Trainer, Project Manager and Architect. You’ll have experienced different customer departments for example IT, Operations, HR, facilities, or Finance. This will help you to better define your career path and what you want to grow into. At the end of this program, you are free to decide if you want to work for one of the customers you’ve worked for or stay with us!

What you bring to the table
People within our organization have different backgrounds and did extracurricular activities next to their studies like an international internship or chairing student unions. Most have a master’s degree in Business Administration, Computer Science or Information Technology. However, this traineeship is not limited to these studies only. For us, your mindset is more important than your background. To give some pointers in whom we’re looking for:
A bachelor or master’s degree in Business Administration / Management and Organizational Sciences / Computer Science / Information Technology / International Business and IT
You speak English and Dutch on a professional level
You have <1 year of working experience
You want to learn, learn, and learn some more!
You love a certain amount of pressure because it brings out the best in you, and you remain calm no matter what
You connect easily with people and get to the core of a business problem or process within a heartbeat because you always start off with the WHY
People trust in what you have to say, and you are straightforward in what they can expect from you and the technical solution you can provide
You love to travel to other places (in and outside of the Netherlands)
What’s in it for you
You can define your own career path and will be guided by a dedicated career counselor. People within our organization grow in many different directions, like Client Account Lead, Team Manager, Project Manager, Lead/Expert Consultant, Solution/Platform Architect, Developer or Director.
It could be that you already have a gut feeling what you’d like to grow into. Experiencing various business IT roles in different projects will help you validate and select one or more roles you want to become an expert in.

Otrium is a purpose-led business – we see a future where all clothing is worn.

Otrium is changing fashion from the inside out: we are an online fashion outlet marketplace and we tech-enable designer brands to find an owner for every item they produce.

Our global business

Founded in Amsterdam and headquartered in the cloud, Otrium also has hubs in New York and London. As a digital-first company, we work around the globe and don't need to limit our HQ to one location or a single hub.

Management consulting Invent
Young Professional

Wil jij de nieuwe manier van werken van een wereldwijde retailer definiëren? Wil je de nieuwste technologie gebruiken om een echt hybride werkplek mogelijk te maken? Wil jij wereldwijde hoofdrolspelers helpen om een werkplek te creëren die klaar is voor de nieuwe generatie professionals? Wij zijn de avant-garde van de transformatie naar het nieuwe normaal.
Momenteel is deze vacature vervuld. Nu al solliciteren? Dat kan! Vanaf 1 Juli 2023 verwelkomen wij graag weer nieuwe kandidaten.

Jouw job in één alinea

Als Digital Workplace Innovator probeer je de waarde uit technische mogelijkheden te halen. De uitdaging voor opdrachtgevers is niet meer de technische inzet maar het juiste gebruik van de ingezette technologie. Wij realiseren de digitale werkplek door gebruik te maken van de nieuwste technologieën, manier van werken en inzichten. We helpen klanten om te transformeren naar een toekomstbestendige organisatie door de ervaring voor medewerkers te optimaliseren, platforms mogelijk te maken en innovatieve oplossingen te creëren. Je voert diepgaande gebruikers- en klantonderzoeken uit, selecteert en past platform (o.a. Google, M365) en oplossingen aan. Je zorgt voor de gebruikerservaring en de adoptie van de oplossingen. Je helpt de klant de uitdagingen van morgen te begrijpen en helpt bij het definiëren van een competitieve strategie en visie om te slagen in de snel veranderende markt van morgen.

Je thuisbasis bij Capgemini Invent

Je gaat aan de slag bij Capgemini Invent en werkt hier samen met collega’s aan opdrachten voor grote (internationale) klanten uit verschillende sectoren. Denk aan retail, transport, overheid, de financiële of de industriële sector. We hebben allemaal een grote passie voor advies en technologie, maar vinden een fijne sfeer en plezier op de werkvloer (en daarbuiten) ook enorm belangrijk. We organiseren regelmatig activiteiten. Zo zijn we op wintersport geweest, hebben we regelmatig borrels en organiseren we teammeetings bij collega’s thuis. Wees gerust, deelnemen is natuurlijk vrijblijvend. We snappen heel goed dat je soms ook even lekker tijd voor jezelf wilt of met familie en vrienden doorbrengt.

Benefits
Cold feet? Kennen we niet. Bij ons krijg je direct een vast contract.
Get the future you want. Vanaf dag één krijg je volop mogelijkheden om jezelf te pionieren en je loopbaan vorm te geven, waaronder de mogelijkheid om verschillende trainingen te volgen. We bieden je grenzeloos vertrouwen én collegiale support.
Een goed gevulde koffer met vakantiegeld én genoeg tijd (26 dagen) om het uit te geven.
Een premievrij pensioen.
Werk flexibel in heel Nederland met onze connectiviteitsvergoeding.
Je eerste levensbehoefte als professional: een laptop en een simkaart die je ook privé mag gebruiken.
Altijd lekker onderweg met je leaseauto of NS-businesscard. Of kies voor uitbetaling van je reiskostenvergoeding.
En uiteraard een passend salaris. Hierover gaan we graag met je in gesprek.


Persoonlijke ontwikkeling

Natuurlijk gooien wij jou niet meteen in het diepe. Je start namelijk eerst met een intensief opleidingsprogramma van The Institute. In The Institute word je gedurende 2 maanden klaargestoomd voor het echte werk met allerlei verschillende typen consulting opdrachten waarbij je intensieve coaching en training ontvangt. Je werkt hierbij samen met uiteenlopende collega's binnen Invent, zodat je alvast een begin kunt maken aan je interne netwerk.

Waarom past deze vacature bij jou?

Je hebt een authentieke interesse in nieuwe technologieën, toekomst van werk, verandering en adoptie en innovatie. Je begrijpt de impact van digitale innovatie of transformatie en bent gefascineerd door innovaties en hun implicaties voor organisaties. Komt dit overeen met jouw profiel? Dan gaan we graag met je in gesprek! Geen enkel bedrijf is hetzelfde, dus het kunnen scheiden van hoofd- en bijzaken is een must. Je wordt uitgedaagd om op verschillende abstractieniveaus te kunnen schakelen tussen strategie, processen, informatie en technologie. Het is dan belangrijk om dit tot uitdrukking te kunnen brengen in een samenhangende strategie of advies. Dit kan een eindpresentatie van een project zijn, maar ook een workshop met opdrachtgevers of intern. Creativiteit en het vermogen om uw conclusies op een sterke verbale manier te presenteren, zijn cruciaal. Uw vermogen om advies te krijgen van een intern netwerk van specialisten zal u hierbij helpen.

Wat verwachten we nog meer van je?

Een afgeronde universitaire master in Computer Science, Innovation Management, Business Administration of Engineering.
Bij veel van onze opdrachten wordt gewerkt met de principes van (scaled) Agile en Scrum. Kennis of ervaring met deze methoden is een pluspunt.
Ben je geïnteresseerd in de laatste technologische ontwikkelingen of ben je daar actief bij betrokken? Vermeld dit in je CV of motivatie.

Fast and predictable projects with a fixed price & scope. Always on the latest release for a fixed fee per month. We offer companies the ability to start small and grow their system as their company and its needs grow.

Within the food industry, we specialize in helping ambitious specialists take the next step. Food companies that dare to challenge themselves and the status quo. Companies that operate lean and expect nothing less from their business system and IT-partners.

In other words: awesome challenging projects for ambitious fast-growing companies. And that…. is where you come in.


You… the key factor for successful projects

What are some job-specific activities?

During implementation projects you will coach junior colleagues, guide customers and optimize the solution.’
After go-live, you will keep in close contact with the customer for future projects and optimizations.
You can independently work out functional designs for customer specific requirements (customizations) and supervise development and implementation of the design.
Use NetSuite as your main tool to help our customers optimize their business processes and tackle bottlenecks.

Another, more commercial task is to stimulate upsell and cross-sell possibilities.

What I like about you…

You have a self-managed style in projects with a limited formal project management role.
You embrace simplicity and volume, instead of complexity and value.
You are willing to learn and capable of absorbing and adopting new information.
And you ensure reliable and flawless service delivery.
You have great knowledge about financial and/or logistical processes
You can combine that analytically trained brain of yours with a ‘can-do get this project delivered attitude’.

You are proactive, social, and commercial

Minimum requirements:
University or Higher Professional Level (Financial, Logistics, or Business Administration).

Adventure: Being part of a start-up dynamic international operating NetSuite team. And yes, you will get on a plane on a regular basis.
Brain-upgrade: The opportunity to learn and further develop your personal set of skills. Formally (certificates/diplomas, etc) and informally (crucial IT skills that have been passed on for centuries).
Tangible rewards: A wide range of competitive employee benefits.
