Internships R&D Centre,"Exciting internships at our Research and Development Centre.
Join our team to solve complex challenges.

Who are we?

Dual Inventive and Core|Vision develop and produce state-of-the-art wireless products that enable people to work more safely and efficiently in the rail sector, whilst maximising rail capacity, and improving reliability.

Our Research and Development Centre

To help develop these products, we are constantly looking for new technologies which can be used in the future to improve the health and safety of the track workers. Here’s where the Research and Development Centre comes in.

While on this journey, we are faced with many challenges that need to be tackled. For example: how do we know which new technologies are available in the world? How can we prove them? And more importantly, how can we implement these technologies in the rail sector?

There will be many more challenges ahead, where your contribution will be crucial to future developments.

Scope of assignment

You will join a creative team, working on your own assignment as part of a bigger challenge.

Your contribution may involve Programming software in Golang, C++, Embedded C, Python and many more languages, experimenting with data simulation, working with machine learning or AI systems, soldering PCBs, using development kits to build your own POC, or testing devices in the field.

Together, we determine the scope of the assignment, so that you and Dual Inventive are excited about it!

Scrum and guidance

Your day will start with a stand-up with the team and your coach. You’ll have two-weekly sprints and there will be opportunities for hybrid working. Periodically, you and the team will demonstrate your current work to the company’s product owners and stakeholders.

During your internship, you will have continuous support from an experienced team of developers and a coach who will guide you through the internship.

Internships

We already have some ideas, but we would like to hear yours too.
Detection of suspicious behaviour

Dual Inventive creates IoT products for railway operators to be able to perform maintenance on the tracks in a safe way. These products (devices) can be operated using a mobile app which in his turn informs our backend system to send a certain state change command to a device. Devices continuously send data about their state and sensors to our backend system.

We would like to research if it is possible to use all this data to detect suspicious behaviour (other than what expected) of devices. Suspicious behaviour might indicate faulty hardware or real-word scenarios not yet known to us.

anomaly-detection, ai, data-warehouse, trend-detection, behaviour-detection, machine-learning, sql, golang
Data retention policies

Data in our operation system must be lean a mean. With a fast growing population of devices and users of our cloud platform and the need for more logging and meta data the total data accretion grows rapidly. We need a solution to archive data to other (cheaper) storage. The chosen solution must enclose that different data types can have different retention times. Some metrics, reports etc must be kept working after data is migrated to ‘archive’. It must also be possible to automatically delete certain ‘marked’ data after a given period.

data-warehouse, retention-policy, time-series, sequential-data, sql, golang, security
Mobile Network Quality Indicator

Dual Inventive’s products use mobile data 2G/4G/5G to send sensor data and receive commands. Because the products are used in the field, this means our product is just as good as the connection available. No connection means our product won’t operate.

Dual Inventive has created a new hardware module called NMDI (Network module Dual Inventive) using a new modem chip. We would like to add a new feature to our products, so users will be able to see the signal quality. Hardware and software for a quality indicator should be developed plus firmware for the NMDI to analyze signal quality and show it on the quality indicator.

This assignment is a follow-up to an internship assignment to create quality indicator which is based on a different modem chipset and is stand-alone. Some of the research done during this internship can be used as starting point.

signal-quality, mobile-network, firmware, c/c++, hardware
Optimal network route selection based on quality

Good connectivity is mandatory to keep our products working properly. Therefore we would like you to research methods how we can define what ‘good’ quality is and implement these methods in a proof-of-technology to show improvements in overall-connectivity in respect of the usage of mobile networks in different countries.

network, connectivity, roaming, fall-back, celltower, rssi, firmware, c/c++
Railway applications – cyber security

Dual inventive uses state-of-the-art solutions to keep our products safe and secure. We are continuously investigating new methods and techniques to keep our products up-to-date.
We would like you to help us to search for new safety-critical techniques and proof this with a proof of technology which can include the complete (or a defined part) end-to-end solution from the device (hardware/firmware) to backend.

cyber-security, devices, backend, safe-protocols, encryption, defense-in-depth, message-integrity, c/c++, golang
Research possibilities track access mobile app in respect to safety

We are using our mobile app in a critical part of our software MTinfo 3000 – safe track access.

We want to be able to warn a user when something is going wrong (e.g. device connection is lost or a battery is getting depleted). Therefore, we need to find out what the safest way of communicating with the user smartphone is.

Research questions include:

What is the safest method of sending messages to the user?
How do we know a message is received?
Can we make the phone play a loud noise and vibrate in case of emergency even though the user has (accidently) turned down his volume (or is flight mode)?
Can we warn a user when he moves to an area where mobile connectivity or internet connectivity drops?
Can we warn users when they leave a secured work zone e.g. geo fencing?

mobile, safe, network, connectivity, app
Research safe (nearby) mobile personal warning device

In respect to the assignment of “Research possibilities track access mobile app in respect to safety” we would like to research for possibilities to warn nearby users in case of when something is wrong.

Use multiple phones and all their communication capabilities (wifi, 4g, 5g, blue-tooth) to create failure proof communication with a cloud servers so one-or-more phones together can act as reliable personal warning device.

DevOps

Within Dual Inventive we use a large eco system for our Continuously Integration and Deployment development release street. We have several assignments for improving our CI/CD.

Create an fully Automated release process from the CI/CD. Which includes deployments to different test, acceptation and production stages. Generate the necessary artifacts for the release package.
Develop a feature flag management tool in GoLang + React for the release circle like , GoFeatureFlags and LaunchDarkly to support deployment, featureflags, canary testing, timed deployment, deploy to certain users

devops, ci/cd, golang, deployment, release-management, artifacs-management
Automated Testing

Testing, testing, testing…. That is necessary within a safe-critical domain. And the more we would like to test, the more we would like to automate. Of-course we have software and acceptation testing, but what about different mechanical scenario testing?

We would like you to help and find out how we can (extend) automated tests with the usage of AI, Image recognition, object detection, etc. for real-life testing and verify hardware functionality in an early stage.

ai, image-recognition, behaviour-testing, software, firmware, hardware, object-detection
Simulation, Load/stress testing, Backend Development, Golang

Currently we have various types of device simulators we use for testing our IoT platform. But using these simulators we still have a couple of problems/downsides:

Currently there is an administrative burden. Simulator ID’s should be known before they can be used. In ideal situation the simulator platform should do all needed task to like provision and clean-up simulator IDs.
Simulators run on one system which of course has a (yet not know) limit (will probably be around 2000), whereas we like to perform load-test with more than 10.0000 or 20.000 simulators.
Having more simulators means think about forking the process and having a distributed simulator setup.
Have a ramp up for testing large number of simulators.
Have the number of devices and individual simulated devices follow scenario’s created based on real-world use, statistics and metrics.
Have a web interface for easy communication with the simulator platform.
Expansion: Currently we are transitioning to gateways per device. The implementation of these gateways makes it possible to simulate the gateway instead of having to simulate the devices. This allows us to more easily load-test the consuming side of the device-data with less-resources (mainly sockets).
How to apply?

We like to think about the possibilities, if you do too then we would like to hear from you!

Graduate Class of International System Install Engineers,"Introduction
Do you like to travel internationally and work at the frontiers of technology? And do you want to work on hands-on challenges in a very demanding international environment? Join ASML and become part of group of young international System Install Engineers. In this role you build the machine from scratch as a very advanced LEGO sculpture at the customer site abroad, within specifications, on time, with quality exceeding the customers’ expectations.
Job Mission
ASML leads the worldwide development, production and sales of with our state-of-the-art lithography systems in the semiconductor industry. In short, we make the machines that make computer chips, or integrated circuits. We build some of the most amazing, complex machines that you will ever see – and the software to run them – to develop smaller, faster and still more affordable chips. It is because of our machines that the world’s technology has steadily evolved.

It’s one thing to design a product – it’s another to build and mass produce it. Our factories are located all over the world, with our main TWINSCAN DUV (deep ultraviolet) and EUV (extreme ultra violet) factories in Veldhoven, the Netherlands. Our Manufacturing and Planning (M&P) department assembles, builds and delivers all our systems from the prototype stage onwards. When the machine is finished in Veldhoven, they are shipped to the customer where the System Install team starts. In the role of System Install Engineer you support the installation of completed systems at customer sites.

Please be advised; when applying for this position we would appreciate your commitment to remain with the install department for at least 3 years.
Job Description
As a System Install Engineer you will be working at the frontiers of technology. What does this mean? Working with accelerations greater than a fighter jet and machines that image billions of sub-microscopic structures, every few seconds. Not only the development of the machine is very important when it comes to the machines of ASML, maybe just as important is getting it safe and well at the customers and making it work.


This graduate class of system install engineers will travel internationally for about 150 days per year. Within the System Install department there are different specializations that you could be hired for (please note that there is no job rotation):

The mechanical install engineers: this team is onsite with the customer when the de-assembled machine arrives. Within approximately 3 weeks the machine will be fully assembled. Having hands-on skills are highly preferred when it comes to these engineers. The machine will be moved in, unpacked, unlocked and all modules mechanically installed, like the cabling, water, gas and vacuum parts. The system will be switched on and checked if water, gas and electrical works properly. Also the team diagnoses faults and solves system failures.


The system install engineers: will begin the integration and qualification process. Their main focus is to calibrate and test the system, including the system acceptance test, fault diagnoses and solving system failures. This position requires a combination of analytical skills (computer testing) and hands-on skills (fixing the problem after being detected). When all tests prove the agreed performance, the install is done and the customer support team will take over for further maintenance of the machine at the customer.


Summarized: a System Install engineer could have the following tasks, depending on what type of engineer you become:
Mechanical installation, adjustment, commissioning of a complete machine;
Perform complex adjustments, perform upgrades, diagnose and solve problems with limited support;
Answer customer questions and assist customers in a professional manner;
Transfer knowledge to local install teams and first/ second line engineers;
Perform administrative duties including service orders, issue resolution tools, handovers, progress reporting, etc.;
Prepare written technical reports if required to do so;
Contribute in structural improvements for the System Install Engineering (SIE) department.

Know that you are an ambassador for ASML at all times (during and outside of work). The team lead will consequently travel towards the different customer sites where Installs take place.
When not working abroad, the engineer is expected to assist Factory operations with the assembly integration, qualification and prepack (=de-assembly + preparing for shipment) in Veldhoven fab.
Education
You have a Bachelor (hbo or university) or Master degree in a technical related study. Preferably (but not exclusively) in Mechanical Engineering, Aerospace Engineering, Electronics, Physics, Mechatronics.
Experience
Given the complexity of the ASML machines, we are looking for people who both have hands-on and theoretical engineering experience (e.g. student projects, hobby, internship). Additionally, you will enjoy extensive engineering training during your first year as system install engineer.


Your experience:
Hands-on experience in a technical environment, preferably related to mechanical engineering
Affinity with assembling and troubleshooting
Experience with or ability to work in an international organization (English spoken) and working with people of different cultures
Dealing with customers and escalation management combined with progress reporting
Working in cross sectional teams and being a real team player.
Personal skills
In order to succeed in this role it is important that you have:
An interest in technology
Good English communication skills with a focus on understanding, supporting, and influencing others
The will to be a committed team player with respect for other cultures
Focus on safety, but with a ‘first time right’ mentality
A passion for hands-on engineering challenges
The ability to understand details without losing track of the bigger picture (helicopter view)
Stress resistance and the ability to remain structured in a dynamic environment
Excellent skills in stakeholder management
Self-steering and self-learning skills.
Context of the position
What will working in shifts look like?
In this challenging position you will be expected to work with a team within the cleanroom at customer sites. You work for at least 50% abroad (mainly in Asia or USA). You will work in shifts of 12 hours, 3 days in a row and after that you’ll have 3 days off. Then the cycle repeats itself. Because you will be working at customer sites, you will highly depend on your team members. As you are away from home for long periods of time, your team members practically become your family. The will to be part of the team and being a team player will be useful during your days off as well.

Selection process
1. After we received your resume and motivation letter, we will inform you within 10 working days if your resume has been selected for the first round of the selection process;
2. The first round consists of an online pre-recorded interview. The candidates that match our selection criteria will be invited to answer a few pre-set questions via HireVue;
