FTE: 0.8 - 1
Job description
This position will contribute to inclusive, fair and sustainable innovation in the health and life sciences, by addressing sector and industry challenges related to innovation and business models. In the biopharmaceutical industry, there is increasing attention for innovation deficits in the market that may be related to significant system and market failures associated with established dominant business models. Such innovation deficits not only relate to financial metrics, but more importantly also result in failures to deliver on society’s most pressing unmet needs. While current business models have become dominant as they reflect the most efficient way to use the resources available to capture and deliver value, they have not been optimized for delivering societal value. Novel, sustainable business models can more adequately deliver on unmet societal needs, and enable transformation of the current innovation system into a sustainable new configuration that adequately addresses and balances people, planet and profit dimensions.


Your duties

Your research approach should be collaborative, with the aim of studying such innovation system challenges and contributing to the sustainability of innovation and business management in life sciences. You build upon proven insight into emerging science and technology that could be the starting point for such system transitions, and an understanding of the valuation and appropriation of tangible and intangible value. In addition to qualitative analysis of sustainable business model dimensions, you will build on the capacity for empirical research and quantitative analyses to fundamentally support this line of research as well as complement and extend the Athena Institute’s research portfolio.


Research at the Athena Institute includes transdisciplinary approaches that involve issue-identification and the exploration of solutions developed in collaboration with actors and stakeholders. The Athena centers its research around four research themes: Emerging science and technology; (Global) health and well-being; Nature, agriculture and environment; Competency development in inter- and transdisciplinary research; and History of knowledge. The successful candidate should be able to build upon proven insight into emerging science and technology and is expected to collaborate with different colleagues in projects across these research themes.


Requirements
A PhD in Management studies, innovation studies, or a related (inter)discipline; an additional background in the health and life sciences is a strong plus;
Fluent in English (and knowledge of Dutch);
Strong and relevant publication track-record, complementing and extending the Athena Institute’s research portfolio, specifically in terms of quantitative analyses;
Teaching experience (e.g., as course instructor, thesis supervisor, etc.);
A university teaching qualification (BKO) or commitment to obtaining it during the tenure track;
Strong collaborator within interdisciplinary teams (listening, flexible, adaptive, pro-active);
Experience with applying for research grants and externally funded projects and ability to meet deadlines and produce deliverables;
Entrepreneurial and relevant business experience;
An (inter)national network relevant to the research lines.

Challenge: Automated coordination in complex mobility ecosystems.

Change: Seamless interaction and integration between transport modes.

Impact: Help design a sustainable, accessible, and connected future
Job description
Are you interested in shaping the future of intelligent urban mobility management?

Mobility is undergoing significant transformations to meet critical challenges in inclusivity, accessibility, sustainability, and resilience. New systems and services are emerging at an accelerated rate, such as on-demand transport, Mobility-as-a-Service, e-scooters, etc., disrupting the status quo of the last half century. Transportation networks are however still managed similarly to how they were managed decades ago, without clear coordination between different modes and operators, often relying on partial / incomplete data exchange.

In this PhD project you will work on new mobility management ideas, which support seamless mobility services: seamless travel for end users, seamless management of those services and networks across multiple modes. The overall aim is to develop an innovative orchestration mechanism which aligns the objectives and interests of the many different stakeholders (operators of different networks) and which ensures, wherever possible, the discovery and adoption of coordinated solutions between those stakeholders.

To achieve these objectives, during your PhD you will use models and techniques from transportation science, control engineering and data science. You will evaluate your ideas through state-of-the-art simulation approaches, using a Digital Twin (which you will help build): a computerized replica of the transportation ecosystem. To develop a new multi-modal orchestration mechanism, you will employ cutting edge techniques from AI to investigate complex multi-agent interactions arising from multiple cooperating/competing stakeholders and to identify win-win strategies.

You will be collaborating with a large network of international partners, spanning nine European countries, as member of ACUMEN – AI-aided decision tool for seamless multimodal network and traffic management. This research & innovation project aims to rethink the state of practice in network and traffic management across Europe and beyond by i) developing innovative, safe, secure and privacy-preserving data collection capabilities; ii) improving accuracy in monitoring and forecasting in mobility systems exploiting powerful AI techniques and iii) developing novel decision-making and management solutions, acting at all network scales and fostering cooperation in the mobility ecosystem. As part of the ACUMEN team, you will contribute to both scientific progress, and to the translation thereof in four concrete cases in cooperation with four EU capitals – Amsterdam, Athens, Helsinki and Luxembourg.

You will further collaborate with members of the AI for Mobility Lab and Data Analytics & Traffic Simulation Lab at the Transport & Planning department, involved in related research topics on aspects of AI, Machine Learning, prediction & predictability, etc.
Requirements
We are looking for an enthusiastic, ambitious candidate, motivated to work in a highly international, multidisciplinary environment. The candidate should have an MSc in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence or Mathematics, or comparable, with strong skills in programming and solid background in Machine Learning. Affinity with transportation problems, as evidenced e.g. through previous projects, is appreciated. You should be motivated by a genuine scientific curiosity, open-minded yet strongly oriented to critical thinking.
