Post Doctoral Fellow - Physics And Astronomy,"The Department of Physics and Astronomy and School of Computing at Clemson University invite applications for one Postdoctoral fellow position in the field of imaging methods with Compton cameras and telescopes.
The successful candidate will work under the mentorship of Drs. Ajello, Leising, Takacs, Hartmann (Physics and Astronomy) and Liu (School of Computing) to develop machine learning algorithms for the reconstruction of images from multiple-scatter Compton detectors. These will be used for astrophysics, such as with NASA’s COSI mission, but also for medical and homeland security applications. The successful applicant will simulate various instruments, and analyze the simulated data to optimize imaging and background rejection methods, and have opportunities to apply them to real data. Familiarity with imaging algorithms, Compton scatter cameras, machine learning, and knowledge of C/C++ and Python are considered important assets.
The anticipated start is August 2023. The appointment will be for two years, and will include several mentoring opportunities.
Applicants must have a Ph.D. in Physics, Astronomy or a closely related area, ideally with some background in gamma-ray or particle astrophysics.
All applications received by April 1 2023 will be given full consideration, and applications will be accepted until the position is filled.
Applications should be submitted via Interfolio at http://apply.interfolio.com/120980 and must include a curriculum vitae, list of publications, a statement of research interests and relevant experience, and contact information for three letters of reference submitted on the candidate’s behalf.

"Postdoctoral Research Associate, Physics and Astronomy","The University of Montana department of Physics and Astronomy invites applications for a Post-Doctoral Research Associate focusing on high-beta stellarator optimization beginning January 2023. This is a full-time, calendar year, renewable position. The candidate will collaborate with scientists from multiple institutions (UM, Auburn University, Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory) to advance understanding and use new approaches for the problem of 3D high-beta stellarator optimization. The postdoc will conduct computational research aimed at developing a workflow to robustly calculate a high-beta 3D MHD equilibrium with the SIESTA and SPEC codes, determine the Mercier and ballooning stability properties and identify its ‘robustness’ against internal islands. The workflow will be used in a numerical optimization framework to explore for new, stable high-beta stellarator configurations. Benchmarking activities with HINT for W7-X configurations will also be performed, with experimental verification activities possible in low-field, high-beta W7-X experiments. The candidate will identify appropriate coil set(s) or a proxy control surface to model the edge topology with an intent to connect with modeling of divertor and plasma-facing components (PFCs) and explore the effects of the heat loads on candidate first wall plasma-facing components as the plasma evolves from ’startup’ to it steady-state target configuration. The workflow and tools developed will be made available for more general use on design of future and existing stellarator configurations.


The successful candidate will be sited either at the University of Montana or at the University of Wisconsin-Madison as part of the collaboration. In addition, the successful candidate will spend time working with colleagues from ORNL and PPPL.
