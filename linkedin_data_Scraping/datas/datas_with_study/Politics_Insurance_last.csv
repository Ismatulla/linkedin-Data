"Engineering Manager, Core Services","Amsterdam, Netherlands | Engineering | Full-time
Not your everyday company
Lemonade completely reinvented how insurance works. As a customer-centric tech company, we created an insurance experience that is smart, instant, and delightful.
At Lemonade, you’ll be working with a group of like-minded makers, who get a kick out of moving fast and delivering great products. We surround ourselves with some of the smartest, most motivated, creative people who are filled with positive energy and good karma.
Unlike most publicly traded companies, we’re nimble and efficient. We take pride in the fact that we still think and operate like a startup. We don’t care much about titles and hierarchy and instead focus on innovation, bold moves, and challenging the status quo.
We’re built as a lean, data-driven organization that relies on a common understating of objectives and goals to provide teams with autonomy and ownership. We don’t like spending our days in meetings and we skip committees altogether. At Lemonade, there’s no such thing as going over someone’s head. We have zero tolerance for bureaucracy, office politics, and lean-back personalities.
As a Public Benefit Corporation and a certified B-Corp, we deliver environmental and social impact using our products and tech. Through our Giveback program, we partner with organizations such as the ACLU, New Story, The Humane Society, Malala Fund, American Red Cross, 360.org, charity: water, and dozens of others, and have donated millions towards reforestation, education, animal rights, LGBTQ+ causes, access to water, and more.
