Software Support Engineer,"Effectory is Europe's market leader in employee feedback. Over the past twenty years, our team of Software Developers has built the coolest and most innovative feedback software there is. We build our software with C#, .NET Core and Angular in an Azure Environment.
With this software, our customers can set up surveys and gather feedback among the employees of a company and find out how they feel about their employers. We work for major companies in the Netherlands and abroad, so these are big and complex projects. Our surveys are sent out to hundreds of thousands of employees that speak dozens of different languages.
Our software landscape consists of several in-house applications. As a Software Support Engineer you master all these applications and know exactly how they work functionally, but also in the back-end. Besides that, you know our processes and how they translate to our systems. You are in close contact with the Customer Success Managers and help them with the more technical aspects of their projects and you support them when they run into issues within our software. They are important users of our software and often need help from someone with extensive technical knowledge due to the complexity of our systems. In some cases, our colleagues run into a bug, a mistake or an error in the system and that needs to be - debugged, fixed, or escalated to the correct development team. In other cases, some things could be wrong with the project settings causing trouble for our clients.
By proactively checking the back-end of the system, you can see whether everything goes well and smooth and with your skills you can do quick fixes if needed.
In any case, you are like a mechanic that makes sure that the engine runs smoothly and, if needed fixes it. So, if analyzing problems, solving puzzles, and helping people gives you energy, then this job could be a great fit for you!

Tasks & responsibilities
Solve problems before they arise by monitoring the back-end of systems.
Work together with our internal colleagues to make sure that all customers can make use of our platform smoothly.
Check configurations.
Fix bugs and come up with suggestions for long term solutions.
Attend sprint reviews and share observations.
Advise on choosing the correct processes and settings in line with client needs and product vision.
We are looking for someone with 2-4 years of working experience, preferably in a Software Support rol, and who has an affinity with complex software systems. Having experience with SQL is a must and you have to be able to read code written in C# and JavaScript and find bugs.


It is most important that you love to dive into problems and solve them. You troubleshoot in a structured manner and keep calm when things get stressful. Besides that, it is important that you have a proactive and service-minded attitude, can work in a team, and that you like to help people. You will have to learn your way around in our domain, which is complex. For this, you must be someone who knows when to ask for help and who is also eager to learn.
This position might be interesting for someone who is currently working in support and that is looking for a next step and who wants to work more proactively. Or for a Developer who doesn't like writing code all day, or a project manager that has a strong affinity with data and has experience with SQL. We're open to discussing the possibilities, what we require is that you are someone who possesses at least some of the skills mentioned previously, living in the Netherlands, speak fluent English, and have the personality to do the job!
