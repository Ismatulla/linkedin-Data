Your new team is fully focused on online, making it one of the fastest growing in the entire company. Together with your analytics colleagues, you will help determine what the future of the platform will look like. Do you want to be responsible for one of the most popular Dutch online platforms? Then this is it for you!

The platform currently has more than a million paying customers and therefore belongs to the top of the Dutch market. It is up to you and your new colleagues to get to the bottom of who those customers actually are and how you can ensure that they remain customers for as long as possible. With perfectly created and implemented measurement plans in Google Analytics and Tag Manager, you ensure that the correct information is collected and you try to map out a 360-degree customer view.

When you know who your customer is, you can level-up in the field of personalized content. Which is one of the subjects that has a lot of potential! Based on the current viewing and visiting behavior of the target group, your perfect analyzes and improvement proposals can eventually make more and more predictions. How cool is it to contribute to the ultimate viewing experience of more than a million subscribers?!

Your team and the teams that are part of this online platform have been data-driven for a number of years. Since data is the future, there are more and more ad-hoc data requests from other teams of the company. That is also something that you as a Web Analyst will support, because the more people in the company see the value of data, the more data-driven your new company can work!

Where on the one hand there is a focus on the online streaming platform, you also have the news and weather platforms within your company. Here too, a lot can still be done in the field of analytics and the ultimate goal of the company is to integrate a uniform customer account so that much more becomes clear in the field of data in one fell swoop. In other words: plenty of challenges to spot opportunities together with your team and to grow in both your skills and on a personal level!

Could this be the next step in your carreer?
