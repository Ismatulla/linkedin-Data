Assistant Professor (career track) in Innovation and Business Management in Health and Life Sciences,"At the Athena Institute of the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, we invite applications for an appointment as assistant professor (tenure-track) in Innovation and Business Management in Health and Life Sciences, specializing in empirical research focused on valuation, innovation, business management, economics, and finance.


Location: AMSTERDAM

FTE: 0.8 - 1
Job description
This position will contribute to inclusive, fair and sustainable innovation in the health and life sciences, by addressing sector and industry challenges related to innovation and business models. In the biopharmaceutical industry, there is increasing attention for innovation deficits in the market that may be related to significant system and market failures associated with established dominant business models. Such innovation deficits not only relate to financial metrics, but more importantly also result in failures to deliver on society’s most pressing unmet needs. While current business models have become dominant as they reflect the most efficient way to use the resources available to capture and deliver value, they have not been optimized for delivering societal value. Novel, sustainable business models can more adequately deliver on unmet societal needs, and enable transformation of the current innovation system into a sustainable new configuration that adequately addresses and balances people, planet and profit dimensions.


Your duties

Your research approach should be collaborative, with the aim of studying such innovation system challenges and contributing to the sustainability of innovation and business management in life sciences. You build upon proven insight into emerging science and technology that could be the starting point for such system transitions, and an understanding of the valuation and appropriation of tangible and intangible value. In addition to qualitative analysis of sustainable business model dimensions, you will build on the capacity for empirical research and quantitative analyses to fundamentally support this line of research as well as complement and extend the Athena Institute’s research portfolio.


Research at the Athena Institute includes transdisciplinary approaches that involve issue-identification and the exploration of solutions developed in collaboration with actors and stakeholders. The Athena centers its research around four research themes: Emerging science and technology; (Global) health and well-being; Nature, agriculture and environment; Competency development in inter- and transdisciplinary research; and History of knowledge. The successful candidate should be able to build upon proven insight into emerging science and technology and is expected to collaborate with different colleagues in projects across these research themes.


Requirements
A PhD in Management studies, innovation studies, or a related (inter)discipline; an additional background in the health and life sciences is a strong plus;
Fluent in English (and knowledge of Dutch);
Strong and relevant publication track-record, complementing and extending the Athena Institute’s research portfolio, specifically in terms of quantitative analyses;
Teaching experience (e.g., as course instructor, thesis supervisor, etc.);
A university teaching qualification (BKO) or commitment to obtaining it during the tenure track;
Strong collaborator within interdisciplinary teams (listening, flexible, adaptive, pro-active);
Experience with applying for research grants and externally funded projects and ability to meet deadlines and produce deliverables;
Entrepreneurial and relevant business experience;
An (inter)national network relevant to the research lines.

Challenge: Automated coordination in complex mobility ecosystems.

Change: Seamless interaction and integration between transport modes.

Impact: Help design a sustainable, accessible, and connected future
Job description
Are you interested in shaping the future of intelligent urban mobility management?

Mobility is undergoing significant transformations to meet critical challenges in inclusivity, accessibility, sustainability, and resilience. New systems and services are emerging at an accelerated rate, such as on-demand transport, Mobility-as-a-Service, e-scooters, etc., disrupting the status quo of the last half century. Transportation networks are however still managed similarly to how they were managed decades ago, without clear coordination between different modes and operators, often relying on partial / incomplete data exchange.

In this PhD project you will work on new mobility management ideas, which support seamless mobility services: seamless travel for end users, seamless management of those services and networks across multiple modes. The overall aim is to develop an innovative orchestration mechanism which aligns the objectives and interests of the many different stakeholders (operators of different networks) and which ensures, wherever possible, the discovery and adoption of coordinated solutions between those stakeholders.

To achieve these objectives, during your PhD you will use models and techniques from transportation science, control engineering and data science. You will evaluate your ideas through state-of-the-art simulation approaches, using a Digital Twin (which you will help build): a computerized replica of the transportation ecosystem. To develop a new multi-modal orchestration mechanism, you will employ cutting edge techniques from AI to investigate complex multi-agent interactions arising from multiple cooperating/competing stakeholders and to identify win-win strategies.

You will be collaborating with a large network of international partners, spanning nine European countries, as member of ACUMEN – AI-aided decision tool for seamless multimodal network and traffic management. This research & innovation project aims to rethink the state of practice in network and traffic management across Europe and beyond by i) developing innovative, safe, secure and privacy-preserving data collection capabilities; ii) improving accuracy in monitoring and forecasting in mobility systems exploiting powerful AI techniques and iii) developing novel decision-making and management solutions, acting at all network scales and fostering cooperation in the mobility ecosystem. As part of the ACUMEN team, you will contribute to both scientific progress, and to the translation thereof in four concrete cases in cooperation with four EU capitals – Amsterdam, Athens, Helsinki and Luxembourg.

You will further collaborate with members of the AI for Mobility Lab and Data Analytics & Traffic Simulation Lab at the Transport & Planning department, involved in related research topics on aspects of AI, Machine Learning, prediction & predictability, etc.
Requirements
We are looking for an enthusiastic, ambitious candidate, motivated to work in a highly international, multidisciplinary environment. The candidate should have an MSc in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence or Mathematics, or comparable, with strong skills in programming and solid background in Machine Learning. Affinity with transportation problems, as evidenced e.g. through previous projects, is appreciated. You should be motivated by a genuine scientific curiosity, open-minded yet strongly oriented to critical thinking.

Job description
The EU aims to have a net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) economy by 2050. At present, heating and cooling represent around 50% of the final energy use in Europe and are mainly supplied by fossil fuel derived energy. Because sustainable heat is mainly available in summer and demand is high in winter, large scale seasonal heat storage is a key strategy to decarbonize heating in order to achieve EU ambitions. TU Delft leads a large European project that will showcase and develop full-scale application of heat storage (up to 90°C) in geothermal reservoirs using three different technologies: Aquifer, Borehole and Mine Thermal Energy Storage (ATES, BTES, MTES), at 6 different sites in Europe which together represent a relevant range of geological conditions across Europe. In this PD project you will contribute to the development and application of a generic, open-source, high-performance and highly scalable framework to assess the Levelized Cost of Energy/Heat - LCOE reduction and carbon emission reduction costs (CRC) of heat storage in geothermal reservoirs in combination with different heat supply sources.

LCOE generating a sustainable energy economy

Many sustainable heat supply systems are characterised by high capital expenditure and low operational costs. Therefore, an installed capacity tailored at peak demand is not cost effective, while extending the annual operation period is advantageous for meeting energy needs, reducing levelised cost of energy (LCOE) and decarbonisation. Optimal utilisation of sustainable heat requires storing large amounts of heat to account for seasonal supply and demand fluctuations. Various technologies have been proposed for large-scale heat storage in geothermal reservoirs and low temperature storage is routinely applied. PUSH-IT focuses on extending storage temperature ranges to high temperatures. We will tackle remaining barriers for high temperature storage, demonstrate applicability, increase public engagement, and optimise and de-risk operations.

In PUSH-IT we will develop a unified framework for the combined or individual techno-economic assessment of heat storage and geothermal heat sources. One of the challenges for such an approach is the combination of subsurface (geological) heterogeneity and uncertainty with the performance of various technical components of the heating systems in varying climatic conditions. To address this complexity, a team of geological and technology experts will work together to build a framework on open-source code (Python) that is high performant and scalable to comprehensively quantify uncertainties using probability theory. The framework will further be able to seamlessly analyse the techno-economic performance of heat storage systems at any time interval required to capture the system dynamics as dictated by demand-side management. Finally, a simplified user interface will be developed to make the interaction with the underlying code more user friendly and accessible. Input from consortium industry partners on component, operational and other costs will be used to validate the techno-economic models. A strong collaboration with consortium members in industry and academia is key.
Requirements
We are looking for an excellent candidate with the following qualifications, knowledge and skills:

A master and PhD degree in applied earth science, civil engineering, mechanical engineering or another degree with experience in developing high performance code in python (libraries : pandas, xarray, dask).
Experience with reservoir simulation and with energy systems modelling, techno-economics is a plus.
A team player who thrives working with people in different organisations with different skillsets, with the goal to have an impact on the energy transition.
A curiosity inspired and creative researcher with an interest in geothermal energy and subsurface heat storage, who is able to plan, execute, deliver and communicate research.
Excellent written and oral communication skills in English.

Conditions of employment
Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, a discount on health insurance and sport memberships, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.

PHD HORIZON EUROPE MSCA DOCTORAL NETWORK “MELOMANES”*,"Metastatic melanoma is a hard-to-treat disease and it remains as one of the most worrisome cancer. There is an urgent need to improve the current therapies (chemotherapy, radiotherapy) that have a limited efficacy.


Location: AMSTERDAM

FTE: 1 - 1
A single therapy is not efficient to tackle metastatic melanoma and a combination of therapies is thus emerging as a necessity to efficiently eradicate all cancer cells. Recently, the development of immunotherapies has shown promises, in particular chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells. Nevertheless, the physical barriers represented by cellular and non-cellular components of the tumor microenvironment combined to the abnormal tumor vasculature and high interstitial fluid pressure, hamper an efficient tumor infiltration of CAR-T cells. In this context, thanks to a network of 18 partners (including 10 non-academic partners), MELOMANES aims to train 12 doctoral researchers for the development of a combined therapy exploiting the properties of magnetic nanoparticles to induce damage on the tumor microenvironment by magnetic and optic hyperthermia in order to facilitate the infiltration of CAR-T cells. Research and transferable training of the doctoral researchers will be performed in a highly interdisciplinary, intersectoral, and international environment. In addition to acquiring skills related to the research project, they will be trained also in open science, communication and dissemination, responsible research and innovation, circular economy, ethics, data management, entrepreneurship, marketing, intellectual property, and gender dimension in research. Their competences will be validated through certification and qualification examination, allowing a new generation of highly skilled doctoral researchers to emerge with a high-level training in particular in the multidisciplinary field of nanomedicine.

DESCRIPTION OF THE INDIVIDUAL RESEARCH PROJECT
The doctoral researcher will design and implement a training program that helps the other doctoral researchers of the Melomanes project to become equipped to be researchers of the future. The past decades we have witnessed a change in the relation between the science and society. It has become increasingly important for researchers to not merely have the capacities to conduct the technical and scientific research work that is part of their daily routines, but in addition, to be able to actively engage with society. The skill set of a capable researcher entails among other capacities, the ability to align research practices and agenda’s with societal needs and concerns, and to critically reflect on social and future consequences of the research itself, while navigating its inherent complexity and uncertainty. By following the training program designed by the doctoral researcher, the other doctoral researchers of the Melomanes project will be prepared for the broad and diverse expectations that are part of current and future academic work.


Objectives

1) Create a training program design that helps the doctoral researchers in the project to develop three key capacities: a) navigating complexity and uncertainty, b) being able to critically reflect on the role of research in society and its social and future consequences and c) being able to design and facilitate meaningful dialogue with societal actors.

2) Implementation of the training program in the Melomanes project

3) Obtain insights into how to effectively train researchers to acquire the above capacities, and how to tailor-make such a training program for specific trans- and interdisciplinary research fields.


Methodology

For the design of the training program the doctoral researcher will make use of systems thinking methodologies and artistic methods. While the first type of methodologies will be an important point of departure for designing sessions that focus on developing the skills needed to navigate complexity and uncertainty while doing highly specialized research work; the second type will be of help in designing training sessions with a focus on developing dialogue and reflexive capacities.
Expected Results

The expected results are 1) the design of a training program that can be adapted for other types of trans- and interdisciplinary research practices and 2) Melomanes doctoral researchers that are prepared for the broad range of skills needed to perform academic research work.

Phd biodiversity modelling,"Are you an aspiring researcher looking for a new opportunity in the field of biodiversity modelling? Would you like to join a friendly and open environment where you can develop your skills and acquire new knowledge? Then you have a part to play as a PhD candidate within the interdisciplinary research project ‘SELINA’!

In this project you will investigate how satellite data from various sources in combination with spatial models and machine learning can be used to measure biodiversity. Biodiversity is complex, yet it is essential that measurable biodiversity indicators are developed that can be analysed with satellite data across a wide range of ecosystems including in the tropics. These indicators are essential to support, for instance, biodiversity monitoring efforts, ecosystem accounting, and the monitoring and verification of biodiversity impacts of ESG investments.

The use of GIS and Machine Learning (ML) to analyse satellite data is key in this project. The methods should be applicable world-wide, and as much as possible high resolution, globally available data sources from earth observation will be used for this study. The research will be supported by field data from various sites, that are organised with local partners. Potential reference sites include the Netherlands, Northern Portugal, Peloponnesus, Greece, Palawan, Philippines, and Mato Grosso, Brazil. This will be done with local partners, and we will also connect to the European Space Agency as well as private sector (e.g. property developers working globally) in this project using existing contacts.

Job description
The Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences is eager to help the society in decision making regarding actions that needs to be taken in view of climate change, energy transition, limited resource supply. These changes comes with extremely complex scientific and engineering questions, that can only be solved with the combined expertise of a multidisciplinary team.

Such a team is for instance the Mudnet academic network, where members study clayey systems (‘mud’) from the perspective of different disciplines. Within the faculty, four members are involved in Mudnet, two from the department of Hydraulic Engineering and two from the department of Geosciences & Engineering. One of the core tasks of Mudnet is to better understand the complex properties of clay/water systems in many different settings and help stakeholders to develop sustainable and circular solutions in mud-related projects. Projects that Mudnet members work on range from assessing the rheological properties of fluid mud in harbours to understand the ripening of dredged material used for land reclamation. A major part of the activities performed by the Mudnet team is connected to measurements, both in the laboratory and in the field. Those experiments are crucial as the parameters measured serve as input for the predictive models the team is developing.

We invite you to apply for a PhD position within the CAINA program to investigate cloud-aerosol interactions in a nitrogen dominated atmosphere.
Job description
Context
Reactive nitrogen is quickly becoming the dominant pollutant in many regions in the world, with important consequences for ecosystems, human health and climate. This leads to changes in atmospheric chemistry and physics that need to be understood in order to more effectively address this pollution. In the CAINA project we are investigating how aerosols and clouds interact in this new nitrogen-dominated chemical regime, by combining field experiments, chamber studies and modelling. The project is based in located mainly the Netherlands, where nitrogen pollution is particularly problematical serious problem. We make extensive use of the Ruisdael atmospheric observatory (https://ruisdael-observatory.nl) with its advanced in-situ and remote sensing infrastructure.

The team
The CAINA team consists of atmospheric scientists from 4 Dutch Universities (University of Groningen, Wageningen University, TU Delft, and Utrecht University) in collaboration with project partners from Germany (MPIC-Mainz, Leibniz Institute for Tropospheric research, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology) and from Cyprus (The Cyprus Institute). We closely collaborate on the project combining expertise in atmospheric and aerosol physics, atmospheric chemistry, cloud remote sensing, and atmospheric modelling.

Your role

 Apply Now
Challenge: Quantify and analyse meltwater storage in Greenland
Change: Use satellite gravimetry
Impact: Better understanding the ice sheet and its potential contribution to future sea level rise
Job description
Since the launch of GRACE satellite mission in 2002, satellite gravimetry became one of the primary tools to study the mass re-distribution in different Earth’s system compartments, including ice sheets. Furthermore, it was already shown by our research team (Ran et al, The Cryosphere, 2018) that a combination of GRACE data with information about the Surface Mass Balance (SMB) allows an accumulation and release of liquid water within the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) to be detected. A quantitative analysis of this process is vital since the increased runoff of meltwater from the GrIS is a major contributor to the acceleration in contemporary sea level rise. Recent research has shown that runoff from the ice sheet to the ocean is delayed by storage on top, inside or underneath the ice sheet. A lack of detailed knowledge about the meltwater runoff is one of the reasons why the contribution of the GrIS to the future sea level rise remains rather uncertain. It is believed that satellite gravimetry may play an important role in gaining such knowledge, since it is a unique remote sensing technique which is sensitive to water mass variations within the entire ice layer, no matter at what depth they occur.

The project will comprise two major parts. In the first part, the PhD candidate will be engaged in a further development of techniques for processing the data from satellite gravimetry mission GRACE and its successor, GRACE Follow-On (GFO). It is proposed to invert GRACE/GFO level-2 data product (monthly sets of spherical harmonic coefficients) into global sets of mass anomalies (the so-called ""mascons""). One of the key tasks at this stage will be to develop a statistically-optimal estimation procedure, taking into account stochastic models of errors in the input data. Furthermore, it will be essential to develop a numerically efficient technique to quantify the accuracy of estimated mass anomalies.

In the second part, the PhD candidate will focus on an extraction of the signal associated with meltwater accumulation within the GrIS. To that end, it will be necessary to clean the input data from all the nuisance signals, including those from Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA), SMB, and ice discharge. Furthermore, it will be important to develop the optimal regularization scheme, which can suppress high-frequency noise in the level-2 data product, while preserving spatial features of the signal to be recovered, including its likely discontinuity along the coastal line. Finally, the PhD candidate will analyse and interpret the obtained signal. For instance, it will be instructive to compare the estimated water mass variations with estimates provided by models of ice sheet hydrology, as well as with air temperatures in a given melt season and with variations in ice flow velocities.

The successfully completed project will lead to better understanding the behaviour of the GrIS, its response to the foreseen climate changes, and its potential contribution to the future sea level rise.

The project will be executed at the Dept. of Geoscienceand Remote Sensing at TU Delft, in a collaboration with Dr. P. Ditmar, Dr. B. Wouters, prof. R. Klees, and other department members. Furthermore, there will be a close collaboration with prof. Michiel van den Broeke and other colleagues from Institute for Marine and Atmospheric research Utrecht (IMAU).
Requirements
You must have a solid background in programming and math (particularly, in statistical theory and the theory of inverse problems). It will also be essential to have a good command of English language, as well as very good skills in oral and written communications. Additional assets are:

Knowledge of physical geodesy (including the spherical harmonic expansion).
Familiarity with physical processes within an ice sheet.
Knowledge of FORTRAN language.
Familiar with parallel programming using the MPI library.

PhD Position Comparison of Different XR Technologies for Pedestrian Behaviour Study,"PhD Position Comparison of Different XR Technologies for Pedestrian Behaviour Study
 Apply Now
Job description
Extended Reality (XR) technologies, such as Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Mixed Reality, provide new possibilities for studying pedestrian behavior. An increasing number of studies have shown that XR can be a valuable addition to the current experimental methods to study pedestrian behavior. Different XR technologies have distinct features regarding immersion, presence, and interaction capabilities. Research shows that the differences among XR technologies might cause people to perceive the virtual environment and behave differently, which ultimately has an impact on the collected behavioral data via XR. Thus, it is crucial to investigate these differences and understand the suitability of different XR technologies for pedestrian behavior study.

In this PhD project, you will be working on understanding the suitability of applying different XR technologies (i.e., VR, AR, and MR) to study pedestrian behavior. You will create novel metrics from the perspective of pedestrian behavior and human-computer interaction to evaluate the usage of different XR technologies for pedestrian behavior study. It will be done via quantitative and qualitative comparison of different XR technologies from different perspectives, in particular concerning validity, effectiveness, applicability, and level of presence. You will investigate this by developing different XR applications, setting up experiments, as well as collecting and analyzing behavior and physiological data. You will be collaborating with other members of the MXR Lab that work on related projects (e.g., wayfinding behavior, evacuation behavior).
Requirements
We are looking for an enthusiastic and ambitious candidate with the following qualifications, knowledge, and skills:

A master’s degree (or equivalent) in computer science, human-computer interaction, or related fields.
A solid background and strong interest in XR technologies and skills in developing XR applications using Unity/Unreal game engine.
Strong and demonstrable experimental skills including experiment design, experiment setup, conducting experiments, and data collection.
Experience in serious game development is appreciated.
Strong analytic and programming skills (e.g., Python, C#) with proficiency in statistics
An open-minded personality with a curiosity-driven mindset, positive attitude towards methodological and interdisciplinary research, and willingness to learn from different fields, including transportation, human-computer interaction, and urban planning.
Prior research and work experience that is relevant to this PhD position is a bonus.
Good communication and writing skills in English

Job description
Erasmus MC, TU Delft, and Erasmus University Rotterdam have joined forces in the Pandemic and Disaster Preparedness Center (PDPC). PDPC aims to prepare society for future pandemics and disasters. We will reduce vulnerabilities and risks and build resilience through effective disaster prevention, preparedness and recovery measures. Convergence of the technical, medical and social sciences is essential for developing the next generation of approaches to disasters and pandemics. In the foreseeable future, our society can expect many more and unforeseen virus outbreaks and extreme events because of climate change. But how do we protect society from the next pandemic or disaster? Which of the lessons learnt could develop prevention and intervention measures, and how could research contribute to preparedness?

One of the pillars of preparedness is a well-functioning early warning system. As most emerging diseases travel quickly around the world via our global transport networks of people, animals and goods, early warning focusing on detection of (trends in) virus (sequences) of concern could potentially prevent outbreaks. In this frontrunner project on integrated early warning surveillance tools and methods, 3 PhD candidates and one postdoc will work with a large multidisciplinary team of senior researchers.The project is highly collaborative. Within the project we aim to identify and characterize critical nodes in the complex global network of transport and migration for the emergence and dissemination of new viruses. Using rapid deployable and innovative sampling and detection methods we will further investigate these critical nodes.

As a PhD candidate in this project, you will develop/refine the sampling systems for water- and airborne viruses via ad hoc and longitudinal surveillance of various environmental matrices in transport hubs (airport/aircraft sanitary water, ships, animal manure, animal cages/beddings, surface dust, wastewater). Research challenges are representative sampling and effective and reproducibly capture and extraction of sufficient virus material. Sampling systems will be validated using a MLII experimental setup developed through collaboration between EMC, WUR and TU Delft, applying different environmental conditions. After validation they will be tested in living labs for intelligent pandemic surveillance in the Port of Rotterdam and Schiphol airport, by sampling airport and sanitary wastewater of intercontinental aircrafts, cruise ships and traded animals and their transport environment. You will explore the possibility to rapidly deploy the sampling systems in (anticipated) flooding events to characterize pathogen inputs/dynamics at sites (rivers, lakes, estuaries, storm water overflows) that are at risk of flooding and collect pathogen data to validate pathogen emission and transport models.

Within the project you will collaborate with one PhD candidate positioned at TU Delft that is working on global transport network analysis and one PhD candidate at Erasmus MC that is working on detection of viruses of concern. In addition, you will take part in field work in the Port of Rotterdam and Schiphol Airport and some of the research will take place at the KWR water research institute, Wageningen University and Research, and TU Delft. During the project you will also closely collaborate with GGD Rotterdam Rijnmond, and Erasmus University.
Requirements
Our ideal candidate is required to have:

A MSc in microbiology/virology with strong affinity for engineering/modelling or vice versa.
A strong background and interest in sampling, detection and modelling of pathogens in water.
An independent, self-motivated and curiosity-driven mind.
Excellent communicator and collaborator skills with peers and partners.
A scientific attitude and analytical skills combined with a hands-on mentality.
Molecular laboratory experience proven by lab courses, internships or other previous work.
Excellent writing skills.
Dedication and enthusiasm for innovative research, combined with scientific curiosity and the capacity for teamwork in an interdisciplinary environment.

Are you a eager to build state-of-the-art experiments and use them to explore quantum physics in a lively, international group?
Our Strontium Quantum Gases Group is looking for ambitious PhD students who want to participate in exciting quantum simulation, sensing and computing experiments. This group is headed by Prof. Florian Schreck and is part of the Quantum Gases & Quantum Information (QG&QI) cluster at the Institute of Physics (IoP) of the University of Amsterdam (UvA) and also hosts the Quantum Delta NL Ultracold Quantum Sensing Testbed. We use ultracold Sr gases for quantum sensing, to study many-body quantum physics and for quantum computing. We have three open PhD positions, one each on the research projects described below. For more information about the projects take a look at our website or contact Florian Schreck.
What are you going to do?

Project 1: Continuous atom laser
In this project you will build the first continuous atom laser. An atom laser is a beam of atoms that is described by a coherent matter wave. So far only short atom laser pulses have been created by outcoupling a beam of atoms from a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). The laser stops working when all atoms of the BEC have been outcoupled, requiring the creation of a new BEC for the next atom laser pulse. BEC creation is usually a lengthy process, requiring several cooling stages to be executed one after the other in time. We have built a machine that can execute these stages one after the other in space, enabling us to Bose-Einstein condense continuously [1]. This allows us to create a BEC that lasts as long as we want. It’s the atomic equivalent of an optical laser with perfectly reflective cavity mirrors. Your goal will be to take the next step and outcouple the first continuous atom laser beam from the BEC. Such a beam would be an ideal source for continuous atom interferometry [2]. A second goal of the project is to create interesting driven-dissipative quantum systems and study their properties.

Project 2: Sr optical clocks
In this project you will build an optical clock based on continuous readout of the Sr clock transition. The clock will exploit our continuous ultracold Sr source technology [1] to prepare large samples of ultracold atoms without losing track of time while preparing those samples. This will enable to reach high clock precision after short averaging times, which is important to improve clock stability and for many clock applications. We are pursuing two approaches to achieve this goal: superradiant lasing and zero-deadtime clocks and you could join either one of these research efforts. You will be involved in every aspect of building your clock, from electronics, over lasers, optics, frequency combs, ultrastable resonators to vacuum chambers. Once the clock is operational you will use it to collaborate with other research teams, comparing zero-deadtime and superradiant clocks, enabling precise qubit operations in our quantum computer (project 3), or studying fundamental physics with precision spectroscopy (with our colleagues at the Free University). For the latter you will participate in setting up a frequency link through telecom fibres to the Free University in Amsterdam and to the Eindhoven University of Technology. This project is part of the Quantum Delta NL Ultracold Quantum Sensing Testbed, which will give you many opportunities to work with industry, in particular to design photonic circuits for optical clocks.

Project 3: Quantum simulation and computing with Rydberg coupled single Sr atoms
Quantum computers and simulators can solve problems that are utterly out of reach for traditional computers. We are building two quantum computers/simulators based on arrays of strontium atoms held in optical tweezers [4], one in our lab and one at the Eindhoven University of Technology. Quantum bits are encoded in the internal states of these atoms and quantum calculations are carried out by shining laser beams onto the atoms in a well-orchestrated way. Quantum computers based on neutral atoms profit from the fact that the atoms are naturally identical and that it is quite easy to scale the computer to hundreds of quantum bits. Our quantum computer is based on strontium atoms, an alkaline-earth element that is also commonly used to build some of the best clocks in the world. Exploiting the clock built in project 2 and supported by QuantumDelta NL and the Quantum Software Consortium we are building quantum computers that can demonstrate algorithms developed by QuSoft or solve quantum chemistry problems. In Amsterdam we can currently trap strontium atoms in an array of 49 tweezers [5]. You will extend this machine with the lasers necessary to implement one- and two-qubit gates and perform quantum simulations and computations with it.

Exciting PhD opportunity to help find solutions for the ever growing volumes of waste caused by mining and mineral extraction.
Job description
Looking for an impactful PhD opportunity in sustainable development?

The demand for mined products is rising due to population and economic growth and the push toward a green energy transition. This leads mining companies to extract and process large volumes of materials and the subsequent production of significant amounts of mine waste. The composition of this waste varies and could have environmental impacts, including soil and water pollution, ecosystem degradation, and posing a significant challenge to sustainable development. On the other hand, mine waste could be a source of raw materials such as Critical raw materials (CRMs), Rare earth elements (REEs), that can be recovered and reused, thus contributing to a circular economy and reducing the need for new extraction. The possible economic benefits and potential environmental consequences underscore the necessity of proactive and efficient management and monitoring of mine waste. An integrated approach, utilizing state-of-the-art sensor technologies and advanced data analytics, could be the key to addressing this challenge.

Are you passionate about making a difference in mine waste management, and striving to improve secondary recovery while minimizing environmental impact?

The Spatio-temporal characterization and modelling of mine waste systems is an important component of sustainable development, promoting the responsible use and management of natural resources while also contributing to economic development and social well-being.

This position presents an exceptional chance to investigate and leverage cutting-edge sensor technologies and advanced data analysis techniques for modelling and characterizing mine waste systems. You will utilize diverse sensor outputs in combination with machine learning approaches to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics in mine waste systems at multiple levels. Through an innovative integrated approach, you will combine various data sources to improve the modelling and understanding of the temporal and spatial evolution of mine waste sites. The research work entails collecting samples from test case sites, utilizing secondary data, and conducting data analysis.

As a doctoral candidate, you will collaborate closely with our team of specialists in the field of mine waste management and monitoring. Your research will play a crucial role in devising successful approaches for managing and monitoring mine waste, thereby contributing to resilient development and the transition to green energy.
