Goal is to optimally inform and engage employees and other stakeholders, because we believe results are achieved by collaboration.
You and your talent

Senior Finance Business Data Modeller,"Senior Finance Business Data Modeller
At a glance

We are looking for somebody with extensive experience (5-10 years) in business, conceptual, logical and physical data modelling. Do you want to be at the core of the data management framework? At the centre of the regulatory requirements? At the top of the internal business modelling capabilities of ABN AMRO? Are you enthusiastic about data modelling? Do you like to learn about new (finance/regulatory) topics? Then you really want to become the new Finance Business Data Modeller!
Finance and Risk are developing at a rapid pace. Technology, external regulation, and internal steering offer numerous new opportunities, as well as challenges. Data Management has taken off and all eyes are on the new data governance and the way we structure our data requirements. Finance FA (Financial Accounting) Reporting is the biggest data consumer of the bank. This consumption is all based on the Finance and Risk Information Model, FRIM.
NOTE: Please be aware that this function is all about modelling data structures, not about finding statistical relationships in the data itself. This function does not look at actual data, does not access databases, does not use statistical or other (big) data analysis techniques.
Your job

Main activities
Perform Business Data Modelling, by designing conceptual and (business) logical data models, and further developing modelling principles and guidelines.
Conduct and lead discussions with subject matter experts, requesters, and other stakeholders to understand and challenge the scope- and the content of the requirements.
Break down requirements into a structured information model that contains terms, definitions, and relations.
Perform stakeholder management with requirements owners, subject matter experts, and users of the data models.
Perform information analysis: being the bridge between business and IT.
Document the conceptual or logical data models with tooling like Erwin Data Modeler.
Business Data Modelling enables us to understand the meaning of data and its relation to other data, so that assumptions and ambiguity are replaced by certainty. It allows us to clearly define what data is needed to generate reports, dashboards and data analysis for customer insights, and provides a one common language. Within ABN AMRO, Finance and Risk have a business data model called ‘FRIM’, which stands for ‘Finance and Risk Information Model’ and can be described as a collection of finance and risk terms, their conceptual definitions and their relationships. A conceptual business view forms the basis for translation to both logical and physical data model.
FRIM is constantly in development. New regulations must be taken up in the model, existing reports, capabilities, and Risk models need to be translated to FRIM and where necessary the model needs to be extended. In your role as Finance Business Data Modeller, you will determine whether new reporting requirements are specified correctly, you will integrate them into the model and develop the Business Data Model of Finance and Risk. Finally, you will participate as Finance and Risk expert in business projects, to ensure that new data structures are aligned with our needs.
Working environment

Data Governance Finance is a small team of highly valued professionals, positioned within Finance. These professionals are involved in a number of Data Management knowledge areas, such as Data Quality issue Management, Dataflow and Processes, Data Lineage, Data Profiling and Monitoring and Data Modelling and the like.
Every employee has his / her own specialism, but also spends some time in other knowledge areas to help, build relationships and grow. We take pride in setting high goals and aiming for the stars. We create a safe environment, where we help each other, stand-in for each other and give trust. We do not mind if a goal is not reached, as long as we can be proud of the part we did achieve. We are not afraid to fail but are very transparent about what we will and will not deliver. We have humour, try to be more than just colleagues and try to take ourselves not too seriously. On the other hand, we will not back away from a good discussion, as long as this is on content or process and not personal.
Within the department you are managed on WHAT you should achieve. HOW you do that, is something you can determine for yourself, within the boundaries of the rules of governance and risk. This setting gives you great freedom. With great freedom comes great responsibility and the need to set your own goals and then try to reach them.

Together, you have global responsibility from a 1st Line of Responsibility perspective to ensure DLL’s compliance with EBA regulation on outsourcing.

As member of the Global Procurement team and closely cooperating with the Outsourcing Manager, you will be responsible for the Global Outsourcing process within the Group. Outsourcing within procurement can be seen as a subset of DLL’s contracts and arrangements with third parties, including Intragroup arrangements between DLL/Rabobank’s entities. These outsourcing relationships need to be assessed before DLL engages into a contractual engagement, but also afterwards throughout the lifetime of the contract.

You will support in ensuring a complete overview of the global outsourcing supplier population is available including risk assessment and mitigating actions. Your focus areas include setting up an efficient outsourcing risk assessment process, repository and workflow as well as internal and external reporting.

Measures:
Within this dynamic role there is opportunity for further developing your knowledge and competences and widening the scope of activities, since Outsourcing is a relatively young domain and many areas require further maturing and optimization. Within the broader Procurement team there are also developments and initiatives that can benefit from your support, and that offers opportunities for growth.

Two working days per year volunteering for a local charity.
Health and Wellness program including healthy food, free health checks, fun health & vitality activities.
