In English, 'uptalk' (the use of pitch rises at the end of statements) can evoke strong reactions; e.g. uptalk is seen as a marker of insecurity and hesitance used primarily by young women. As a PhD candidate, you will critically evaluate the existing literature on British English uptalk and carry out production studies and perception experiments to understand the phonetic forms uptalk can take, its pragmatic functions, and its social evaluation.

We are looking for a PhD candidate in sociophonetics, focusing on the study of prosody, for a project on uptalk in British English. Uptalk is defined as the use of pitch rises (instead of falls) at the end of statements. Stereotypically, uptalk is said to indicate speaker insecurity or a cooperative attitude, while its use has been associated with younger women who are often said to talk as if they are asking questions.

There are, however, many issues with these stereotypes about uptalk. First, there are many varieties of British English (e.g. in Bristol, Liverpool, and Tyneside) in which rises are used by default at the end of statements. These rises are not considered instances of uptalk on the grounds that they do not convey some special meaning. This implies that uptalk carries such special meaning, but speakers of varieties said to have uptalk (e.g. varieties in New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and California) do not assign special meaning to all instances of uptalk. This begs the question of what counts as uptalk and what criteria can be used to determine if uptalk is a feature of a given linguistic variety. Further, research in uptalking varieties of English suggests that uptalk has diverse uses and that different forms of uptalk may be associated with different pragmatic functions. Finally, these studies also suggest that uptalk is not used exclusively by certain demographic groups, such as young women; in turn, this indicates that uptalk may be wider spread but noticeable only when used by speakers of certain groups because the stereotypes of the listeners lead them to expect uptalk only from these groups.

Given the above uncertainties, the aim of this project is to critically evaluate the existing research on uptalk from phonetic, pragmatic, and sociolinguistic perspectives, focusing on British English uses and users of uptalk. The goals of the project include a thorough documentation of the forms that uptalk can take, a better understanding of the pragmatics associated with it and of the social evaluation that it leads to, depending on the demographics of the users.

For this project, you will be supervised by a team of researchers consisting of Prof. Amalia Arvaniti (Chair), Dr Stefan Gronderlaers and Dr Jarret Geenen (co-supervisors). Though the scope of the project is indicated above, it is expected that the final research plan will be developed in collaboration with you to reflect your research interests as well as those of the PhD committee.

Your teaching load will be up to 10% of your working time.

Profile
You hold a Master's degree in linguistics.
You have demonstrable grounding in at least two of the following: phonetics, sociolinguistics, pragmatics.

You have a good understanding of either corpus-based or experimental methods in linguistics preferably demonstrated by work experience, publications, or a relevant Master's thesis.
Demonstrable interest in the study of prosody will be a strong advantage.

The full project consists of five linked working groups that will address dominant spaces of representation of belonging, both in the formal institutional space of education and healing, as well as informal spaces of sports, popular culture, and urban arts. The goal of the project is to come to a more inclusive understanding of Europe.


Your duties

The Athena Institute’s main task in WP5 on ‘healing: embodied and located knowledges’ is to gather and critically analyze processes of knowledge integration between academic and non-academic knowledge-holders, so as to achieve a more resilient society.

We aim to identify post/de/colonial grass roots organizations and communities that have been affected by colonial history, study how their positions are negotiated through embodied knowledge, and explore various healing interventions addressing the afterlives of the affected communities. We seek to understand how healing can take place even across affects that are understood as negative, such as anger, shame or guilt. The Athena Institute is exploring this in various case studies: ‘traditional healing in the Dutch Caribbean’, ‘Indisch Zwijgen among diverse Indonesian communities in NL, ‘healing among victims of the toeslagenaffaire in NL. Using reflexive monitoring and action we aim to contribute to the transformation of a more inclusive Europe. How can we measure social impact of healing interventions better?

Social media have become increasingly important in people's daily lives. Young people in particular spend numerous hours in the online world and use social media as a primary means to manage their social lives. This has already prompted a surge in research on the uses and effects of social media. Interestingly, whilst the online world is often mirroring the offline world, it also provides distinct peer behaviours (e.g. victimisation, co-rumination, deficiency behaviour), potentially due to its unique characteristics (e.g. asynchronicity of communication, permanent availability, cue absence). Little is known about differences between young people's off- and online worlds; how they differently affect peer processes that are crucial for youth development and well-being; and how they impact behaviour.

In this PhD project, you will focus on peer processes on social media. Specifically, you will investigate the unique characteristics of peer processing in online worlds and their risks and opportunities. Subsequently, you will examine how they relate to (risky) behaviour in both on- and offline worlds. Within this general theme, you will have the flexibility to determine the specific focus of the project. Any innovative ideas you might already have about the project we would like to read in your motivation letter.

You will be employed within the Behavioural Science Institute (BSI), embedded in the Communication & Media research programme. As a PhD Candidate, you will initiate, develop and execute several studies. You will write scientific papers, resulting in the completion of a PhD thesis at the end of your employment contract. You will participate in supervision meetings as well as staff meetings of the Communication Science department and other relevant research meetings. As part of the BSI Graduate School PhD programme, you will be expected to complete several courses related to the basic professional skills of scientific researchers such as presentation skills, scientific integrity, and data management. We also encourage you to attend and present your work at relevant workshops and conferences. As part of your PhD position, you will have a 10% teaching load and the opportunity to work towards a university teaching qualification.
Profile
You hold a Master's or Research Master's degree in Behavioural Science, (Developmental) Psychology or Communication Science.
You have good research, methodological and statistical skills.
You preferably have experience with quantitative research and research methods for mapping digital behaviour (e.g. ESM, data logs, or screenome analysis), or are willing to acquire these skills.
You are familiar with research practices that increase transparency in social science (e.g. pre-registration, data-sharing) or are willing to adopt such an approach.
You have an affinity with young people (10-18-year-olds) as a research group.
You have good social skills and interests to learn and think across disciplines.
You are a team player but also able to work independently.
You have good written and spoken English language skills (required for scientific publishing).

Are you interested in how higher education institutes (HEIs) can create an environment that promotes student well-being and learning? Are you interested in how university programmes can play their part in current planetary crises through education for sustainability? We have an opening for a PhD candidate devoted to transcending the disciplinary boundaries between transformative learning theories, the philosophy of social sciences and education for sustainability. Are you ready to play your part?


For decades, debates have stressed the various crises HEIs are currently facing. On the one hand, student well-being has come under pressure, as recent reports show that many students experience stress, academic pressure, and little attention for personal development. On the other, there is a vast discrepancy between knowledge building and building of wisdom or action, the so-called knowledge-action gap, particularly in the field of sustainability. While transformative education approaches have been designed to meet these challenges, they are often implemented outside of the regular programmes of HEIs and based on project funding, limiting their long-lasting potential.


This PhD project focuses on the design, implementation and impact on students of transformative education practices for sustainability at HEIs. In these practices, learning is conceptualised as action, taking place in context, and conducted together. In this project you will conceptualise and co-create learning environments by putting transformative theories of education for sustainability into regular academic practice. You will use both quantitative and qualitative methods. A more elaborate description of this project can be requested from Petrie or Saskia (see contact details below).


You will be employed at the Behavioural Science Institute (BSI), embedded in the Learning & Plasticity research programme. As a PhD candidate, you will work together with four researchers who have diverse disciplinary backgrounds (sustainability pedagogy, philosophy of behavioural sciences, student success and diversity in higher education, educational sciences). You will be asked to bridge these paradigms and you will have ample opportunity to further design your own PhD project.


As a PhD candidate, you will initiate, develop and execute several studies. You will write a PhD thesis to complete your project. You will participate in supervision meetings as well as staff meetings of the Learning & Plasticity department and other relevant research meetings. As part of the BSI Graduate School PhD programme, you will be expected to complete several courses related to the basic professional skills of scientific researchers such as presentation skills, scientific integrity, and data management.

Profile
You hold a Master's or Research Master's degree in behavioural science, educational sciences, pedagogical sciences, philosophy of behavioural sciences, biology, or a related field.
You are able to critically reflect on theories in the field of social sciences and you are strong in conceptualisation.
You have an affinity for various research methods.
You have an affinity for interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary problems/work.
You are familiar with or would like to become familiar with research in higher education, transformative education and education for sustainability, student well-being and diversity.

You have excellent written and spoken English language skills (required for scientific publishing).
We are
You will join the Learning and Plasticity group. The Learning and Plasticity group conducts fundamental and applied research on individual differences in the learning and development of children, teenagers and adolescents.

Individual differences lie at the heart of our research. We study variations between and within homogeneous age samples in order to describe, predict and explain how people learn and develop. We focus on both typically developing groups and samples with an atypical development in one or more areas (e.g. attention deficits, visual impairment, coordination disorder, giftedness).

Our research relates individual differences in learning and development to characteristics of the individual, the knowledge and skills they have to acquire and the context in which their learning and development takes place.

The outer ring of the doughnut chart represents the main application areas of our research. Each area comes with specific themes, which are prompted by either academic or societal relevance and shape the research questions we seek to answer. Examples include differentiated forms of teaching, learning, treatment and intervention, adaptive and dynamic assessments, and policy measures regarding equal opportunities and inclusive education.

The Learning and Plasticity group is part of the Behavioural Science Institute (BSI). BSI is a multidisciplinary research institute and one of three research institutes in the Faculty of Social Sciences at Radboud University.

Developing organizational arrangements for artificial intelligence in public surveillance
Job description
We are looking for an enthusiastic PhD candidate with a background in the field of policy analysis, public administration, policy sciences or a related field to study and develop organizational implementation arrangements for Artificial Intelligence (AI) for regulatory surveillance. The position is a for 4-year PhD track, financed by the Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management, department of Multi-Actor Systems in close collaboration with regulatory agencies.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly used in regulatory processes. No wonder, AI promises a more effective regulatory supervision process, in which inspectors on the floor are advised on the basis of AI-generated risk analysis. Technically there are still many development possibilities. However, whether AI can be applied effectively and responsibly also raises organizational issues, such as:
Professionalism of the inspectors. Risk analyses were conducted before the AI era. These often took place in the minds of professional inspectors and/or during work meetings. In other words: not only data, but also inspectors are an important source of knowledge about risks. Their knowledge is often implicit and based on years of experience. Application of AI can count on resistance from professionals. Not only that: too aggressive application of AI can come at the expense of their valuable knowledge.
Data pollution. Too much risk-based supervision can lead to data pollution: data mainly comes in from those under supervision who have previously been identified as being high-risk. Other people under supervision can thus remain out of sight. They can change their behaviour. There will therefore always be a demand for risk-based random supervision, in which random samples are also used for supervision. Within an organization there are different ideas about the right ratio.
Ethical issues. There is a lot of discussion about bias, protection of vulnerable individuals, transparency and privacy. Of course, these discussions also exist internally. This means that those involved – data scientists, inspectors, managers – make trade-offs between values. Many decisions about data and algorithms can be leading for the outcomes. These decisions increasingly seem to be made 'at the front', the data experts. This presents challenges with regard to the management of the data experts.

Based on these signals, we conclude that further development of AI has both technical and organizational dimensions. Successful development and implementation of AI will therefore have to be linked to the organization of supervisory practices.

How are technical development of AI and the supervisory organization connected and how can this connection be improved? Much literature on AI focuses on technical possibilities, while other literature deals with ethical concerns. Far less literature discusses the actual implementation and use of AI in organizational practice. A study into this subject should have two characteristics:
The research is interdisciplinary. It has both innovative-technical aspects and social-scientific aspects. The question is about the interplay between the two.
Connected to practice. We are looking for the application of AI in the context of practice. That is why we want to conduct empirical research, using one or more cases. The research will be carried out in close collaboration with the Dutch Food and Product Safety Authority (NVWA).
Requirements
In this project you will study and develop arrangements that bring together the world of AI and managements of surveillance.

This requires understanding of AI (data science, machine learning, programming) and more intangible processes of organization, including organization structures, informal coordination and organizational politics. It includes both analysis and design efforts. It will involve conducting case studies at NVWA

We are looking for someone who:
has a Master's degree and a background in policy analysis, public administration or a related field
has affinity (and preferably also demonstratable experience) with AI
has affinity (and preferably also experience) with organizational science
has the ability and interest to cross disciplinary boundaries
is fluent in English, both written and orally
has pro-active communication skills and is able to work well in a team

Doing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and a final thesis. For more details please check the Graduate Schools Admission Requirements.

Since the project is developed in close cooperation with a Dutch inspection agency (NVWA) that mostly communicates in Dutch, a candidate that speaks Dutch or is willing to learn the Dutch language is preferred.
Conditions of employment
Doctoral candidates will be offered a 4-year period of employment in principle, but in the form of 2 employment contracts. An initial 1,5 year contract with an official go/no go progress assessment within 15 months. Followed by an additional contract for the remaining 2,5 years assuming everything goes well and performance requirements are met.

Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities, increasing from € 2541 per month in the first year to € 3247 in the fourth year. As a PhD candidate you will be enrolled in the TU Delft Graduate School. The TU Delft Graduate School provides an inspiring research environment with an excellent team of supervisors, academic staff and a mentor. The Doctoral Education Programme is aimed at developing your transferable, discipline-related and research skills.

The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance and sport memberships, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged. For international applicants we offer the Coming to Delft Service and Partner Career Advice to assist you with your relocation.

"PhD position on a project related to ""Cooperation and Rationality""","Location: AMSTERDAM

FTE: 0,8 - 1
Job description
The Department of Philosophy at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam has a vacancy for a PhD researcher on a project related to “Cooperation and Rationality”.


Possible projects: in many situations, agents often have reasons both for and against cooperating. What makes cooperation nevertheless successful? This question can be approached both descriptively and normatively. In the descriptive realm, empirical research has looked at investigating the factors that foster cooperation. In the normative domain, philosophical work has been dedicated to discussing various conceptions of rationality. We invite projects situated at the interface of these two fields, which raises questions such as: Which conception(s) of rationality are actually at work in empirical studies of cooperation? And which ones would be best suited for understanding cooperation?


The PhD project will be carried out in close collaboration with and will be supervised by dr. Jelle de Boer, dr. Lisa Bastian and prof. dr. Lieven Decock.


Your duties
conduct research on the topics of “Cooperation and Rationality”, resulting in a PhD dissertation and journal publications
participate in the research activities of the Philosophy department and the PPE programme (and related national and international events)

participate in the VU PhD training program
Requirements
the candidate has a (preferably Research) Master degree in Philosophy or Economics/Behavioral Science, attained before September 1, 2023
the candidate has a Master degree or a Bachelor degree in Philosophy or in PPE
the candidate has affinity with analytic philosophy, decision/game theory, and empirical studies of cooperation (as shown in grade transcripts, final thesis, and curriculum vitae)
excellent spoken and written English as well as strong academic writing skills are essential
What are we offering?
A challenging position in a socially involved organization. The salary will be in accordance with university regulations for academic personnel and amounts € 2,541 (PhD) per month during the first year and increases to € 3,247 (PhD) per month during the fourth year, based on a full-time employment. The job profile is based on the university job ranking system and is vacant for at least 0.8 FTE.


The appointment will initially be for 1 year. After a satisfactory evaluation of the initial appointment, the contract will be extended for a total duration of 4 years (or 5 years in case of a 0.8 FTE contract).


Additionally, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam offers excellent fringe benefits and various schemes and regulations to promote a good work/life balance, such as:
a maximum of 41 days of annual leave based on full-time employment
8% holiday allowance and 8.3% end-of-year bonus

The Context

The Computer Science department of the University of Twente is expanding. Therefore, we are hiring 6 new faculty members, to strengthen our research in Artificial Intelligence, Cyberphysical systems and Software Engineering in the domains of (1) e-Health and (2) energy and sustainability. These new faculty members will be assigned in different research groups, but inter-group collaboration with other researchers working on these themes is considered essential to reach our overall ambitions. One of the six positions is in the Human Media Interaction (HMI) group and focusses on research in e-Health.


The Position

Research into multimodal conversational systems such as chatbots, virtual humans, or social robots to coach people to live a healthier lifestyle, both from a physical and mental perspective, has seen a steady growth in the past couple of years. With the introduction of conversational systems such as ChatGPT and Bard, it looks as if smooth natural language conversations with an AI system have become possible. However, lifestyle coaching systems need a more sensitive and controlled mechanism to decide on what personalized advice to give. They need to be sensitive to the possibly vulnerable physical and mental state of the user and be aware of the possible effects of their advice. Furthermore, the information they provide should be communicated in a convincing way, but also be reliable and trustworthy. We are looking for a candidate with an AI background that can contribute to intelligent systems that can realise these goals.

Human Media Interaction (HMI) is a diverse and interdisciplinary research group that studies and designs interactive systems that users can intuitively interact with, ranging from Brain Computer Interfaces to Conversational Systems and Ambient Intelligence applications. In the area of Conversational Systems, HMI has expertise on speech technology, dialogue systems, embodied conversational agents and social robots. On the theme of e-Health, HMI has a strong tradition in contributing to a variety of coaching systems such as applications to increase physical fitness, advice on particular conditions (asthma, diabetes), or helping people to stop smoking or drinking. Research is conducted in coalitions with other research groups from inside and outside the University of Twente and with external stakeholders such as hospitals, rehabilitation centers, elderly homes, etcetera.

Your profile
You have a strong interest and have shown ability to collaborate in an academic, multidisciplinary environment;
You have a PhD degree in Computer Science, or related discipline with a focus on relevant areas in Artificial Intelligence;
You have demonstrated the ability to perform high-quality research in one of the fields relevant to the topic: natural language processing, dialogue systems, virtual humans, or social robots;
You have shown a willingness to acquire external funding and are prepared to expand your skills in this respect;
You have good communication skills and are a team player;
You are fluent in English (knowledge of, or willingness to learn Dutch is an advantage);
You have a University Teaching Qualification (Dutch: BKO) or equivalent or you are willing to acquire one within three years.
Our offer
We offer a permanent position with a one-year probationary period (formally a 1-year contract with prospect of permanent contract).
The position comes with a start-up package that will be allow you to appoint one PhD student.
Our terms of employment are in accordance with the Dutch Collective Labor Agreement for Universities (CAO) and include a holiday allowance of 8% of the gross annual salary and a year-end bonus of 8.3%.
Depending on your relevant background and experience, the gross monthly salary on a full-time basis ranges from € 3974,- (scale 11) to € 6181,- (scale 12) gross per month.
A minimum of 29 leave days in case of full-time employment based on a formal workweek of 38 hours. A fulltime employment in practice means 40 hours a week, therefore resulting in 96 extra leave hours on an annual basis.
A solid pension scheme.
Free access to sport facilities on campus.
We are a family-friendly institution, which offers parental leave for both parents (both paid and unpaid) and career support for partners.
We appreciate diversity of profiles, cultures, and backgrounds, and promote an inclusive working culture.
Furthermore, we offer excellent professional and personal development programs.
Finally, you will work in a lively, inspiring, and dynamic working environment in an organization focusing on internationalization, where you will have a high degree of responsibility and independence.

PhD position: Learning from food systems transitions – enabling community resilience,"Do you want to contribute to solving societal issues in the domain of food systems? Do you have a MSc degree in sociology, anthropology, development studies or related field with an interest in food systems? If yes, then we may be looking for you!

The Social Sciences Group (SSG) at Wageningen University is looking for a motivated PhD candidate to study relations between food system transitions and community resilience. The position is based in the Rural Sociology Group (RSO) and will be supervised by Professor Han Wiskerke and Dr Jessica Duncan with active supervision and collaboration with Dr Sietze Vellema from the Knowledge, Technology and Innovation Group (KTI), and Dr Marion Herens from Wageningen Centre for Development Innovation (WCDI).

Broad scope of the project
Advancing sustainable and inclusive development requires fundamental changes in the institutional architecture of food provisioning. Food insecurity continues to be major societal challenge, catalysed by the implications of climate change, biodiversity loss, pandemics, political conflicts, and war. Thus, unpredictability and uncertainty are major challenges currently confronting food provisioning systems.

A gap in research addressing these challenges relates to the prevailing assumptions and normative frames underlying (and reproducing) current food system rationalities. Solutions for the aforementioned challenges are often sought within formal food economies and globalized and industrialized agri-food value chains. As a result, the potential of highly contextual and self-organized forms of food provisioning is neglected or misunderstood. The PhD-project endeavours to not only problematize prevailing norms but also make visible alternatives.

The proposed PhD project will analyse and compare alternative and self-organized pathways for food system transition, with a specific interest in unravelling how local communities and small and medium food enterprises creatively respond to the challenges related to crises and risks affecting food and nutrition security. The PhD research will include an interest in pathways emerging in the Global South while allowing space for comparative research. We look for empirical studies of community or territorial-level mechanisms to expose what enables or constrains food provisioning systems to increase access to healthy, nutritious, affordable, and culturally appropriate food in the context of crises or shocks.

The starting point for the research is locally embedded initiatives, ranging from self-provisioning and food sharing to the ways in which smallholder producers, processors and traders are integrated into agri-food chains. Inserting knowledge from situated modus operandi into mainstream policy and practice may form an entry point for scaling resilient and self-organized practices and catalysing transformative processes. Studies will question:
How do self-organized food provisioning networks and markets emerge from or sustain in times of food crises, including those related to lockdowns?
How do community initiatives promote food security and healthy eating?
Which values are at stake, and which governance and/or organizational principles guide such efforts?

When having a conversation, we not only produce sound but also move our bodies, heads and hands to the rhythm of our speech. This four-year PhD project focuses on beat gestures (simple up-and-down hand movements), testing how they contribute to low-level audiovisual speech perception, using virtual avatars, eye-tracking, and training studies.

Human face-to-face conversations are inherently multimodal, combining speech with gestures that are closely temporally aligned to the spoken signal. However, how this synchrony between voice and hands impacts audiovisual speech perception remains understudied. Recently, the 'manual McGurk effect' (Bosker & Peeters, 2021) provided a proof-of-concept that the timing of simple up-and-down hand gestures (beat gestures) can change what words we hear. This PhD project aims to determine how and when gestural timing influences audiovisual speech perception, specifically targeting more naturalistic communicative settings.

You will use virtual avatars, allowing careful control of their gestural movements, to establish which kinematic and communicative properties of hand gestures trigger the manual McGurk effect. You will assess how challenging listening conditions impact the perceptual weighting of visual, auditory and audiovisual cues to prominence, as well as determine the time-course of these cues using eye-tracking. Finally, you will design training studies to test how humans adjust their perception to between-talker variation in gesture-speech alignment.

This four-year position is funded through the ERC Starting Grant 'HearingHands' awarded to Dr Hans Rutger Bosker. You will be part of the Speech Perception in Audiovisual Communication (SPEAC) lab. The supervisory team consists of Dr Hans Rutger Bosker and Prof. James McQueen, but you will work closely with all members of the SPEAC lab.

Your educational training programme will be provided by the Donders Graduate School for Cognitive Neuroscience, providing a tailor-made training programme at the highest international level. This programme includes courses, workshops, and tutorials covering scientific topics and research techniques, as well as soft skills such as writing and presentation.

As a PhD candidate at the Donders Institute, you will be required to devote 10% of your time to teaching or other academic activities, such as lab management and committee work.
Profile
You hold a Master's degree in Phonetics, Psycholinguistics, Experimental Psychology, Cognitive Neuroscience, or a related field.
You are passionate about conducting scientific research and are interested in the topic of audiovisual speech perception.
You have hands-on research experience, for instance in the form of an empirical thesis project, lab rotation, or internship.
You know how to write code and scripts for stimulus manipulations (such as Praat and ffmpeg), analysis pipelines (such as R and Matlab), and experimental design ( such PsychoPy and Presentation).
You have a strong statistical background and are familiar with advanced analysis methods, such as linear mixed-effects models, time-series analysis and Bayesian statistics.
You have an excellent written and spoken command of English.
Knowledge of Dutch is an advantage.

Professor of Architectural and Urban History,"Professor of Architectural and Urban History
Faculteit/Dienst: Faculteit der Geesteswetenschappen
Opleidingsniveau: Gepromoveerd
Functie type: Wetenschappelijk Personeel
Sluitingsdatum: 26 April 2023
Vacaturenummer: 11325
The Faculty of Humanities employs just under 1,000 employees, and approximately 8,000 students study there. The faculty consists of eight departments: Philosophy, Dutch Studies, Media Studies, Art and Cultural Studies, History, European Studies and Religious Studies, Amsterdam Centre for Ancient Studies and Archaeology, Modern Foreign Languages and Cultures, and Literature and Linguistics. Each department is composed of capacity groups, which consist of one or more professors and a number of employees who work in the relevant field.

The Department of Art and Cultural Studies has a vacancy for a full professorship in:

Architectural and Urban History 1,0 FTE (permanent position)

What will you do?

Context of the chair
The Professor of Architectural and Urban History is affiliated with the Amsterdam School of Historical Studies (ASH) and the Arts and Culture department (more specifically the Art History chair group). The basis for the chair is the historical approach of architecture from an art history perspective: this is of fundamental importance in order to ensure the necessary broad Humanities outlook for interdisciplinary research and teaching within and outside the UvA. In addition, the perspective will be broadened to include urban history, with special attention in the research dedicated to the experience of the urban environment; a more international interpretation that does not yet exist in the Netherlands. The new colleague to be appointed will therefore have architectural history experience with an added focus on contemporary urban history and urban design history, as well as the interplay between the built and natural environment, in which environmental history experience (the role of the historical city in its natural environment) is extremely desirable. The focus in this regard will be on a historical perspective that can be linked to modern-day problems of the urban and architectural living environment. This means that expertise in various approaches to the built environment, for example based on experience of the living environment (perception of the environment) will be expected.
The professor will be responsible, in particular, for teaching in the Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Art History, as well as in the Bachelor in Global Arts, Culture and Politics. The professor will play a significant role in both the teaching for the Master’s track Stadsgeschiedenis (Urban History) within the department of History, European Studies and Religious Studies and for various other degree programmes. In addition, the new professor is expected to undertake administrative tasks.

The chair will provide a strong starting point for the aforementioned collaborations within the University, but also with researchers and external institutions, such as Arcam, Het Nieuwe Instituut, the Cultural Heritage Agency, urban authorities and NGOs. The professor is expected to play a leading role in these types of collaborations.

Teaching
The professor will first be responsible for the Architectural History components within the Art History capacity group (capaciteitsgroep Kunstgeschiedenis). Architectural History is one of the four chair groups within the Art History capacity group, in addition to Medieval Art History (Middeleeuwse kunstgeschiedenis), Art History of the Early Modern Period (Kunstgeschiedenis van de nieuwere tijd), and Modern and Contemporary Art History (Moderne en hedendaagse kunstgeschiedenis). Approximately a quarter of the compulsory curriculum of the BA is therefore provided by the Architectural History chair group. In addition to these components, Architectural History also provides three successful BA specialisations, which can also be taken as electives (see also Minor): Ontwerpen voor de moderne stad (Designing for the Modern City); Dit is Amsterdam: identiteit en beeldvorming in kunst en architectuur (This is Amsterdam: identity and perception in art and architecture) and Reparatie en imitatie. Over het gebouwde erfgoed in het ‘eigentijdse’ Amsterdam. Over het gebouwde erfgoed in het 'eigentijdse' Amsterdam. (Repair and imitation. About the built heritage in ‘contemporary Amsterdam).

Secondly, the professor will make an important contribution to the minor Architectuur en Stedenbouw (minor in Architecture and Urban Planning). This is taken annually by approx. 20 students (mostly Human Geography, Urban and Regional Planning, and Geography students, in addition to students from other studies, including English, Economics, Communication Science, Philosophy, Sociology and Anthropology). The minor also provides a basis for the interdisciplinary Master’s track Stadsgeschiedenis (Urban History, department of History, European Studies and Religious Studies: approx. 5 minor students move on to this track annually. Finally, the professor will play an important role in the BA programme Global Arts, Culture and Politics, particularly the major in Sustainability).

Research
The professor will conduct research within the research school Amsterdam School of Historical Studies (ASH). It is important for the research school that the professor’s research ties in with the new methodological and theoretical developments within architectural history that also considers, in addition to the built environment, the urban perception of the environment from a social perspective and sensory experience. An additional expertise in the interplay between the built and natural environment is desirable. The new professor will take a central position within the Centre for Urban History within ASH. This centre has developed into an important pillar within ASH for interdisciplinary research into the history of the city from antiquity to the present day, with approximately 35 staff members from various disciplines. The professor is expected to assume a connecting and guiding role within this centre. In addition, the professor will be responsible for setting up broad interdisciplinary collaborations with researchers within the Faculty of Humanities (FGw) and the University of Amsterdam (UvA), for example with Urban Studies within the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences (FMG), leading to individual or group applications for research financing (ERC, NWO, NWA, etc.). In addition, an international orientation (with corresponding network) is desirable in order to guarantee the leading role of the chair in Amsterdam within a field that is increasingly globally oriented.
The newly appointed professor is further expected to have knowledge of contemporary, innovative and digital research methods, which provide insight into issues about the digital built environment, the digital city (also an important theme within the MA track Urban History) and the living environment, and to collaborate with researchers in Creative Amsterdam: An E-Humanities perspective, and the 4D-Research Lab.

It is expected that the professor to be appointed will be able to enthuse and mentor young researchers; that the professor will have experience in PhD supervision and be able to contribute to creating a safe and stimulating environment for PhD candidates. The professor will also bear responsibility for actively recruiting PhD candidates by means of submitting grant applications in the Netherlands and abroad.

Leadership
The professor to be appointed will preside over the Architectural History chair group with five staff members, which will include two lecturers, a professor by special appointment and two assistant professors, and will have to perform administrative duties at the level of the educational administration (programme director BA of MA), research organisation (e.g. research director of ASH or the national research school for art history) and/or at departmental level (capacity group chair Art History, departmental chair Arts and Culture). Expansion of the administrative capacity is needed within these various levels. Given the desire to create an environment for employees and students that is safe and inclusive, it is of vital importance that the professor to be appointed possesses organisational sensitivity and exercises leadership that is appropriate in this regard.

Your tasks and responsibilities:
teaching Architectural and Urban History, including supervising Bachelor’s and Master’s theses;
contributing to innovation and improvement of the curriculum in the field of Architectural and Urban History;
addressing research themes and projects within the chair group and research groups;
actively pursuing external funding for research, notably funding from research councils, on national as well as European level;
carrying out HR responsibilities within the Architectural History chair group;
carrying out administrative and management tasks within the Department and Faculty.

What expertise do we require of you?

Successful candidates for the position are expected to meet the following requirements.
You:
hold a PhD in Architectural History or a related academic field;
have an excellent international academic reputation and publication profile, which match the research themes of ASH;
have an affinity with inclusive, polyphonous historical scholarship and digital methods;
are an experienced and engaged teacher at all levels of academic training;
have expertise in developing and renewing teaching programmes at Bachelor’s and Master’s levels;
can show a track record of applying for/acquiring external research funding;
have experience with attracting and supervising PhD projects and junior researchers;
have proven management and leadership qualities and are a dedicated administrator;
have a broad national and international network with academic and cultural institutions;
have an affinity with outreach and knowledge exchange beyond academic settings;
have a Dutch Basic Teaching Qualification, or a willingness to acquire one within the first two years of your appointment;
have a good command of Dutch and English. If you are not fluent in Dutch, you have a willingness to pass the State Exam Dutch as a Second Language (NT2), programme II within two years of the employment contract. The Faculty will assist in this process.

Please also check the document ‘Information about chairs at the Faculty of Humanities’ for more information.
