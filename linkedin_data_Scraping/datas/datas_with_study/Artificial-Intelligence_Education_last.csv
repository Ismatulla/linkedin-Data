PhD researcher in Criminal Procedure Law and AI for intelligence analysis,"Location: AMSTERDAM

FTE: 1 - 1
Job description
Do you want to study one of the core legal and regulatory issues relating to the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for intelligence analysis in criminal investigations?

And do you want to contribute to a vision on how to regulate such AI through criminal procedure law and technology?


This PhD position on Criminal Procedure Law and AI for intelligence analysis at the Criminal Law group of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam is part of an interdisciplinary research project ‘AI4Intelligence’. You will join an exciting and vibrant community where legal scholars, computer scientists and public administration experts meet and form interdisciplinary teams that work at the intersection of Criminal Procedure Law and Technology.


Your duties

What are you going to do?
The main goal of using AI for intelligence analysis is to produce evidence that can be used in criminal cases in court. However, in order to translate AI-generated information into admissible court evidence it must comply with the general evidentiary requirements of reliability and lawfulness. There are two interrelated reasons that make satisfying these requirements difficult. First, there is a lack of (clear) rules as to how the evidentiary requirements – developed for analogue situations with different types of evidence in mind – are to be operationalised in the context of AI in the criminal process. And, second, AI diminishes the transparency and explainability of the evidence-creation process. The resulting effect reduces the possibility of the judge and the defence to question and contest AI-generated evidence (i.e., ‘contestability’). The end result is that neither the judge nor the defence can properly assess whether the content of the information is truthful and has been obtained through legal methods. The lack of contestability of AI-generated evidence therefore has a significant effect on one of the core rights and principles of the criminal process: the right to a fair trial and the accompanying principle of equality of arms.


Building on existing work on AI-regulation, due process and digital evidence, this PhD will engage with the following questions. What enables the contestability of AI-produced evidence in court? How could and should requirements of transparency and explainability (as stemming from the right to a fair criminal trial) be understood in the context of AI-generated evidence and its ‘black box’ nature? To what extent can the requirements of transparency and explainability be ‘hardcoded’ in AI-tools themselves? And can a ‘dialogue-based’ approach to explainability via symbolic-AI and interactive visualisation techniques, which allow for the inclusion of contextual knowledge, mitigate issues relating to the trouble with hardcoding complex legal rules?


The PhD is a part of an NWO-funded interdisciplinary research project (‘AI4Intelligence’), which enables close collaboration with the Department of Information and Computing Sciences and the School of Governance at Utrecht University, and the Visual Analytics group (Department of Mathematics and Computer Science) at Technical University Eindhoven. Through close collaboration with researchers in law, computer science, visual analytics and public administration, you will conduct cutting-edge interdisciplinary research into the regulation of AI for intelligence analysis. With your interdisciplinary collaborative work you will be able to translate research results into innovation and influence policymaking in the Netherlands.
Requirements
a completed master’s degree in law; knowledge of Dutch criminal law is a plus;
affinity with questions of criminal law and technology and a knowledgeable curiosity for AI;
excellent academic credentials, as demonstrated by grades and/or curriculum vitae;
a creative mind and strong critical and analytical skills;
an interest in working across legal disciplines, using different methods (e.g., interdisciplinary and empirical) and collaborations with non-legal disciplines;
an excellent command of English; knowledge of Dutch is a plus.
If the vacancy appeals to you, but you are doubting whether you are THE person we are looking for, please do apply. We welcome applications from underrepresented backgrounds.

The Asser Institute, based in The Hague, and affiliated with the University of Amsterdam is seeking an enthusiastic POST-DOCTORAL RESEARCHER IN INTERNATIONAL LAW AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE on a full-time basis (38 hours per week/1 FTE). They will join the research strand on Disruptive technologies in peace and security within our Research Agenda Rethinking public interests in international and European law, and take part in the NWO-funded research project ELSA Lab Defence.

Disruptive technologies in peace and security
The research strand on Disruptive technologies in peace and security conducts research on technologies that have disruptive implications for international security and international law, including military applications of artificial intelligence (AI), data-driven warfare, biochemical weapons, and conventional weapons or dual use technologies with a disruptive potential. Our research focuses, in particular, on the development of the international regulatory framework for the military and security applications of disruptive technologies. Two main lines of enquiry guide research within this strand: on the one hand, we question how legal norms and ethical values can shape technologies, and on the other hand we analyse how technologies challenge our legal norms and ethical values.

Current research projects in the strand include the DILEMA project (Designing International Law and Ethics into Military Artificial Intelligence), the I2RAMP project (Implementing International Responsibility for AI in Military Practice), and initiatives in the field of international arms control law.

ELSA Lab Defence
The ELSA Lab Defence is a research project addressing Ethical, Legal and Societal Aspects (ELSA) of AI in the defence sector. The project aims to develop an assessment and design methodology that helps translating ELSA into (socio-)technical requirements, and establishes a practical and pragmatic research, development and deployment process for AI-based applications. The interdisciplinary project consortium is led by TNO and includes, next to the Asser Institute, the Delft University of Technology, Leiden University, the Nederlandse Defensie Academie (NLDA), and the Hague University of Applied Sciences. The ELSA Lab is funded by NWO under the synergy theme Human-centric AI for an inclusive society: Towards an ecosystem of trust.

Developing organizational arrangements for artificial intelligence in public surveillance
Job description
We are looking for an enthusiastic PhD candidate with a background in the field of policy analysis, public administration, policy sciences or a related field to study and develop organizational implementation arrangements for Artificial Intelligence (AI) for regulatory surveillance. The position is a for 4-year PhD track, financed by the Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management, department of Multi-Actor Systems in close collaboration with regulatory agencies.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly used in regulatory processes. No wonder, AI promises a more effective regulatory supervision process, in which inspectors on the floor are advised on the basis of AI-generated risk analysis. Technically there are still many development possibilities. However, whether AI can be applied effectively and responsibly also raises organizational issues, such as:
Professionalism of the inspectors. Risk analyses were conducted before the AI era. These often took place in the minds of professional inspectors and/or during work meetings. In other words: not only data, but also inspectors are an important source of knowledge about risks. Their knowledge is often implicit and based on years of experience. Application of AI can count on resistance from professionals. Not only that: too aggressive application of AI can come at the expense of their valuable knowledge.
Data pollution. Too much risk-based supervision can lead to data pollution: data mainly comes in from those under supervision who have previously been identified as being high-risk. Other people under supervision can thus remain out of sight. They can change their behaviour. There will therefore always be a demand for risk-based random supervision, in which random samples are also used for supervision. Within an organization there are different ideas about the right ratio.
Ethical issues. There is a lot of discussion about bias, protection of vulnerable individuals, transparency and privacy. Of course, these discussions also exist internally. This means that those involved – data scientists, inspectors, managers – make trade-offs between values. Many decisions about data and algorithms can be leading for the outcomes. These decisions increasingly seem to be made 'at the front', the data experts. This presents challenges with regard to the management of the data experts.

Based on these signals, we conclude that further development of AI has both technical and organizational dimensions. Successful development and implementation of AI will therefore have to be linked to the organization of supervisory practices.

How are technical development of AI and the supervisory organization connected and how can this connection be improved? Much literature on AI focuses on technical possibilities, while other literature deals with ethical concerns. Far less literature discusses the actual implementation and use of AI in organizational practice. A study into this subject should have two characteristics:
The research is interdisciplinary. It has both innovative-technical aspects and social-scientific aspects. The question is about the interplay between the two.
Connected to practice. We are looking for the application of AI in the context of practice. That is why we want to conduct empirical research, using one or more cases. The research will be carried out in close collaboration with the Dutch Food and Product Safety Authority (NVWA).
Requirements
In this project you will study and develop arrangements that bring together the world of AI and managements of surveillance.

This requires understanding of AI (data science, machine learning, programming) and more intangible processes of organization, including organization structures, informal coordination and organizational politics. It includes both analysis and design efforts. It will involve conducting case studies at NVWA

We are looking for someone who:
has a Master's degree and a background in policy analysis, public administration or a related field
has affinity (and preferably also demonstratable experience) with AI
has affinity (and preferably also experience) with organizational science
has the ability and interest to cross disciplinary boundaries
is fluent in English, both written and orally
has pro-active communication skills and is able to work well in a team

Doing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and a final thesis. For more details please check the Graduate Schools Admission Requirements.

Since the project is developed in close cooperation with a Dutch inspection agency (NVWA) that mostly communicates in Dutch, a candidate that speaks Dutch or is willing to learn the Dutch language is preferred.
Conditions of employment
Doctoral candidates will be offered a 4-year period of employment in principle, but in the form of 2 employment contracts. An initial 1,5 year contract with an official go/no go progress assessment within 15 months. Followed by an additional contract for the remaining 2,5 years assuming everything goes well and performance requirements are met.

Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities, increasing from € 2541 per month in the first year to € 3247 in the fourth year. As a PhD candidate you will be enrolled in the TU Delft Graduate School. The TU Delft Graduate School provides an inspiring research environment with an excellent team of supervisors, academic staff and a mentor. The Doctoral Education Programme is aimed at developing your transferable, discipline-related and research skills.

The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance and sport memberships, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged. For international applicants we offer the Coming to Delft Service and Partner Career Advice to assist you with your relocation.

Are you interested in developing state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, designing new algorithms, and being prepared to take-on impactful problems such as developing a real-life surgery schedule? The section Business Analytics at the Amsterdam Business School (University of Amsterdam) invites applications for a PhD position in Operations Research and Machine Learning. We are looking for talented PhD candidates with the ambition to work and succeed at the highest international academic level.

What are you going to do?

Our project aims to leverage machine learning to develop better decision-support tools to improve healthcare processes. Healthcare is under increasing pressure, and healthcare practitioners cannot possibly oversee the effects of all their decisions. Bad planning and hasty decision-making can lead to unwanted side effects, such as high waiting times for the operating room or overcrowding in the recovery ward. We believe that many of these issues can be avoided by suitably leveraging data in the planning and control of healthcare processes.
Instead of relying on simplifying assumptions to create elegant theoretical models, as used in much of the published research, we aim to develop data-driven models that are usable in practice and compliant with the current privacy regulations. The research will require a blend of data analytics and machine learning, to perform predictive modeling, and operations research, to do the mathematical modeling. A key starting point is to improve surgery scheduling by employing a comprehensive and recent dataset of real-life scenarios. The research will be done in collaboration with hospitals.

You will/tasks:
studying and taking classes to improve research skills and deepen one’s understanding of healthcare systems, operations management theory, and IT and management information systems;
identifying relevant research questions and translating these into a sound research approach;
publishing research results in international academic journals, and presenting them at international conferences;
participating in and contributing to departmental research functions, including research seminars and research meetings;
teaching-related activities, including undergraduate tutorials and the supervision of MSc and/or BSc thesis projects.

What do we require

Master’s degree in Mathematics, Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, or a related discipline;
excellent programming skills in one or more of the following languages: R, Python, C, C++, and a strong willingness to develop these skills further;
excellent communication, presentation and writing skills;
an excellent command of English, ideally with experience in writing for a scientific audience;
commitment, perseverance, and a cooperative attitude.

Our offer

The compensation package is competitive at the European level and includes several secondary benefits. Favourable tax agreements may apply to non-Dutch applicants. and uva.nl/working-at-eb.

The employment contract will be for three or four years (depending on prior education) with an initial period of 18 months, with an intermediate evaluation after 18 months and a possibility to extend it for 30 months (in total four years). The end-result should be a PhD thesis. An educational plan will be drafted that includes attendance of courses and (international) conferences.

The gross monthly salary will range from €2,541in the first year to €3,247 (base on 38 hours per week) in the last year. The Collective Labour Agreement (CAO) for Dutch Universities is applicable.

What else do we offer
A function in which your initiative and input are strongly valued.
an enthusiastic and warm team that is open to new colleagues.
an inspiring academic and international work environment at the centre of Amsterdam.

Challenge: AI that generalizes reliably to new situations.

Change: Make neural networks certain about their predictions.

Impact: Help AI to leap from the simulator to the real world.
Job description
Are you interested in machine learning for intelligent decision making? Would you like to overcome fundamental challenges and bridge the gap to physical agents like robots, autonomous cars or automated factories? Create new cutting edge neural network architectures to empirically solve theoretical problems in artificial intelligence? Think about broader implications and practical applications?

Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has been at the core of many recent success stories in AI, in particular for playing strategic games like Go, Chess and StarCraft. Despite those spectacular breakthroughs, RL is rarely used in practice, as the learned control policies are generally not assumed to be reliable enough for deployed robots or autonomous cars. We want to change that!

During your PhD, you will develop new algorithms which generalize to situations that differ significantly from training. This will be possible by controlling a graph neural network's internal epistemic uncertainty, that is, how much the network trusts it's own computations. You will evaluate your work on multi-task RL benchmarks, where the agent learns one policy that is able to solve more than one task. Examples are simulated Mujoco robots or different levels of the same computer game. Your challenge will be to study, propose and empirically verify the properties that improve generalization in these benchmarks. You will be collaborating with other members of the Algorithmics group that work on related projects. See for more information on the team and our mission.
Requirements
You hold an MSc degree or a similar degree with an academic level equivalent to a two-year master's degree in either Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Mathematics or a similar area and have an interest in Deep Reinforcement Learning. You want to know more about fundamental questions in autonomous control and enjoy empirically validating theoretical predictions and hypotheses. You possess a strong background in machine learning, and have good programming and math skills. Familiarity with Python and a deep learning framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow (and potentially links to past projects) are appreciated. Prior research experience, in particular in thematically relevant or particularly interesting projects, is a bonus.

Doing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and a final thesis. For more details please check the Graduate Schools Admission Requirements.
Conditions of employment
Doctoral candidates will be offered a 4-year period of employment in principle, but in the form of 2 employment contracts. An initial 1,5 year contract with an official go/no go progress assessment within 15 months. Followed by an additional contract for the remaining 2,5 years assuming everything goes well and performance requirements are met.

Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities, increasing from € 2541 per month in the first year to € 3247 in the fourth year. As a PhD candidate you will be enrolled in the TU Delft Graduate School. The TU Delft Graduate School provides an inspiring research environment with an excellent team of supervisors, academic staff and a mentor. The Doctoral Education Programme is aimed at developing your transferable, discipline-related and research skills.

The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance and sport memberships, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged.

Job description
Security Threat Intelligence hybrid workflows
For security threat intelligence humans and artificial intelligence collaborate to obtain actionable intelligence. Their sources and methods often have significant uncertainties and biases. Experts are aware of such limitations but lack formal means to handle these uncertainties in their daily work. You will collectively work towards the high-level goals of building a ""metadata of uncertainty’’ for threat intelligence (in both machine-readable and also human-interpretable forms) and validating it empirically. Intelligence agencies could then explicitly reason about the trade-off between accuracy, proportionality, privacy and cost-effectiveness of investigations. This contributes to using AI for a better security and securing AI for a better society.
Do you want to advance the state of the art in this exciting interdisciplinary topic?
Your duties
To contribute towards solving a key scientific challenge in the area of security and intelligence
