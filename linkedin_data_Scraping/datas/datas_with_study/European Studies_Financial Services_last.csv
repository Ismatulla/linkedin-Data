You will have an impact
Do you want your work to have an impact on financial stability and on the banking sector´s ability to support sustainable growth? As an internal model expert at DNB you can do just that in a stimulating and professional environment. Your contribution to the (European) supervisory goals will consist of the participation in impactful assessments of regulatory internal models, with a primary focus on credit risk.
This is what you will be doing as an internal model expert at DNB.
You will conduct inspections of credit risk models according to the advanced internal rating based approach (A-IRB) completely or partially at the banks premises. You will also deliver analyses and advice in the areas of internal models and quantitative credit risk management with a view to supporting DNB’s mandates in banking supervision and financial stability. Finally, you may also be involved in occasional off-site model assessments and benchmark studies as well as the development of analytical tooling and assessment methodology, both within DNB and/or in collaboration with European colleagues. The latter may include the application of advanced data science techniques.
Your main responsibilities as a model expert will include:
Conducting inspections on A-IRB models at different banks as part of a team of experts.
Drawing sharp conclusions, reporting and presenting your findings to the bank’s (senior) management.

The vacancy in the Internal Model Department (20 staff).
The inspections that you will be involved in are project-based. The project team composition may vary per inspection. Inspections are to a large extent coordinated - and increasingly conducted - on a European rather than a national level. Depending on their seniority, model experts may also expected to assume coordinating roles in the model investigations.
In your role as expert you may be asked to join internal and international working groups on specific parts of the regulation or supervisory manual with regard to A-IRB model aspects. Next to this, you can help by using your programming skills to improve and automate our supervisory inspection tools, which range from custom programs to evaluate internal models to complex machine learning techniques to (for example) summarize documents and reports.
This combination of roles and responsibilities means the job is varied and offers great potential for expanding your knowledge and experience as a quantitative risk professional in terms of both substance and skills. In addition you will have the opportunity to access a wide range of training resources, including dedicated courses on key supervisory processes, data science and soft skills.
Dit breng je mee
This is what we need from you
At DNB you will work with experts of a high professional standard. Against this background we are looking for candidates with strong analytical skills, an independent mindset and a sharp judgement.

You communicate effectively with both experts and non-experts, are able to hold your own in discussions and to translate diverging views into deeper insights. You are a team player with proven effectiveness in multidisciplinary and international teams. We expect you to know modelling, validating, and/or stress testing bank´s A-IRB credit risk models, and have experience in these activities.

Thorough understanding of applicable regulation and regulatory guidelines (including, but not limited to, the CRR and ECB Guide to Internal Models).
Experience in programming in software packages for statistical and data analysis such as R/Python/SAS/Matlab and SQL for data querying is considered a strong asset.
Excellent written and verbal communication skills in English and a willingness to learn Dutch as part of your onboarding at DNB.
Willingness and ability to occasionally participate in inspections abroad (Eurozone).
