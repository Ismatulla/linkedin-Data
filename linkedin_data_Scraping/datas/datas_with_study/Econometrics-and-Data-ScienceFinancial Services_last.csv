Graduate Quantitative Researcher,"Can you solve this puzzle?

An ant leaves its anthill in order to forage for food. It moves with the speed of 10cm per second, but it doesn't know where to go, therefore every second it moves randomly 10cm directly north, south, east or west with equal probability.

If the food is located on east-west lines 20cm to the north and 20cm to the south, as well as on north-south lines 20cm to the east and 20cm to the west from the anthill, how long will it take the ant to reach it on average?
What is the average time the ant will reach food if it is located only on a diagonal line passing through (10cm, 0cm) and (0cm, 10cm) points?
Can you write a program that comes up with an estimate of average time to find food for any closed boundary around the anthill? What would be the answer if food is located outside an defined by ( (x – 2.5cm) / 30cm )2 + ( (y – 2.5cm) / 40cm )2 < 1 in coordinate system where the anthill is located at (x = 0cm, y = 0cm)?

Unique and challenging position for an internal model expert in the on-site banking supervision.
Jij hebt impact
You will have an impact
Do you want your work to have an impact on financial stability and on the banking sector´s ability to support sustainable growth? As an internal model expert at DNB you can do just that in a stimulating and professional environment. Your contribution to the (European) supervisory goals will consist of the participation in impactful assessments of regulatory internal models, with a primary focus on credit risk.
This is what you will be doing as an internal model expert at DNB.
You will conduct inspections of credit risk models according to the advanced internal rating based approach (A-IRB) completely or partially at the banks premises. You will also deliver analyses and advice in the areas of internal models and quantitative credit risk management with a view to supporting DNB’s mandates in banking supervision and financial stability. Finally, you may also be involved in occasional off-site model assessments and benchmark studies as well as the development of analytical tooling and assessment methodology, both within DNB and/or in collaboration with European colleagues. The latter may include the application of advanced data science techniques.
Your main responsibilities as a model expert will include:
Conducting inspections on A-IRB models at different banks as part of a team of experts.
Drawing sharp conclusions, reporting and presenting your findings to the bank’s (senior) management.
Performing through analyses, conducting benchmarking studies and developing analytical tooling and assessment methodology, either at DNB or in international working groups.
Expanding and actively sharing your specialist expertise within DNB and the European Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM).
Hier doe je dat
This is where you will be working
You will be based at DNB’s premises in Amsterdam. You will be working at the On Site and Banking Expertise Division (OSBE), which conducts on-site inspections and provides expertise in all relevant areas of financial and non-financial risks, employs around 100 professionals with various backgrounds and nationalities and consists of 7 departments. The vacancy in the Internal Model Department (20 staff).
The inspections that you will be involved in are project-based. The project team composition may vary per inspection. Inspections are to a large extent coordinated - and increasingly conducted - on a European rather than a national level. Depending on their seniority, model experts may also expected to assume coordinating roles in the model investigations.
In your role as expert you may be asked to join internal and international working groups on specific parts of the regulation or supervisory manual with regard to A-IRB model aspects.
