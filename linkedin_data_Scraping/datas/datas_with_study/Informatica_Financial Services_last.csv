Senior Data Scientist - Detecting Financial Crime,"Senior Data Scientist - Detecting Financial Crime
At a glance

The Detecting Financial Crime – Data Science Innovation Team is one of the largest and fastest growing data science teams within ABN AMRO. We are working on smart solutions to detect financial crime, including money laundering, terrorist financing and human trafficking. Criminals are never resting and all the time come up with new ways to stay out of sight, so we need to continuously adapt and innovate to beat them to it. Our work is in the full limelights, from the senior management of the bank, the national regulators such as DNB, as well as from society as a whole. This illustrates the important role that we play as gatekeeper of the financial system. The work that we do forms the core of that. How cool is it to contribute to that?
In the Detecting Financial Crime (DFC) unit, we’ve brought together every activity the bank undertakes to detect financial crime. By combining knowledge, expertise, and joining forces, we can do a better job of keeping our banking systems free of financial crime and embracing new developments. The advancing technology is both an opportunity and a threat. It helps us to improve our investigative work and it increases the sophistication of organised crime. In short, detecting financial crime is an ongoing process that makes the highest possible demands of our expertise and alertness.
Your job

The Data Science Innovation team (DSI team) is responsible for data science innovations to create a future proof DFC and bank in general. Our team’s current main focus is on transaction monitoring and KYC, but our scope is the broader DFC domain. The DSI team aims to transform the traditional transaction monitoring landscape into an advanced version by creating state-of-the-art machine learning technologies (e.g. anomaly detection, network analytics, NLP) that detect financial crime (money laundering, terrorist financing, human trafficking etc.) in an effective way, using machine learning and advanced network analytics. Furthermore, DSI also plays a crucial role to shape the future of DFC operations through AI transformation.
In collaboration with the business, Compliance and DFC operations you will be responsible for the development and continuous improvement of new transaction monitoring models aimed to detect financial crime. In this process, the data-driven models are continuously being tailored to the needs of the business and the evolving financial crime threats. Being able to interpret the results of the models and to explain the functioning of the models to the stakeholders is key.
Together with a junior data scientist you’ll be responsible for a use case. This includes involvement of the stakeholders and developing a plan of approach. As a senior data scientist, you are expected to take a leading, pro-active role and to contribute to the strategic development of the team and a future-proof way of working.
Are you a data scientist who likes to take initiative and venture off the beaten track? What are you looking for in the next stage of your career? Turn your goals into reality and work on your professional and personal development. Tell us your story. We can’t wait to hear from you!

All of this impacts our relevance as an organisation and our continuity. We accomplish this by lining up the interests of our clients, the bank and society at large.
DFC is a relatively new department that is still in the development stage. The fact that the department is in transition will give extra depth to your role. In this dynamic environment, you’ll have the opportunity to help the department get to the next stage and initiate improvements.
Your profile
