Moreover, they will be teaching in a dynamic context in which new methods are being developed. Art and Culture Studies at UvA is a large and highly successful academic department that connects research and teaching in Art History, Cultural Studies, Theater Studies, Music Studies, Heritage and Memory Studies, and Museum Studies.
