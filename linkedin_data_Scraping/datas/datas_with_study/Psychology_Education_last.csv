PhD position in meta-research: The effectiveness of interventions to improve psychological science,"Tilburg University | Tilburg School of Social and Behavioral Sciences is looking for a PhD position in meta-research: The effectiveness of interventions to improve psychological science

Department : Methodology and Statistics
Location : Tilburg
Full-time equivalent : 1.0 FTE (40 hours per week)
Monthly full-time gross salary : €2.541 (first year) - €3.247 (fourth year)
Duration of employment contract : 12 and 36 months

We are looking for an ambitious PhD candidate who is driven by the motivation to improve science, and is not afraid of a challenge!

Your position
In this PhD project, you will empirically assess the effectiveness of proposed/implemented interventions in the publication system to improve robustness of psychological science. You will study whether the intended effect(s) is/are achieved, but also whether there are any positive or negative side-effects (e.g., can researchers “game” the system? How does the intervention affect diversity and inclusion?).
A rough outline of the project would entail:
Project 1: Conduct a systematic review of the current proposed/implemented interventions to improve reproducibility and replicability of psychological research findings.
Project 2: Conduct retrospective observational studies comparing papers that were or weren’t subject to certain interventions. This can include comparisons of different research fields where different best practices are the norm.
Project 3: Implement a randomized controlled trial to directly test the effect of certain interventions at the study or journal level on reproducibility and replicability.

You are encouraged to make this research your own, by choosing your own specific focus and project implementations.

Research context
You will work under direct supervision of dr. Michèle Nuijten and prof. dr. Jelte Wicherts. You will be part of the Meta-Research Center (https://metaresearch.nl), a renowned research group working on a variety of topics within meta-research in psychology (i.e. publication bias, meta-analysis, causal inference, p-hacking, preregistration, qualitative research). You will have ample opportunity to collaborate within the research group, and you are encouraged to seek collaborations outside the Meta-Research Center as well.
Your findings on the effectiveness of interventions to improve psychological science can have direct impact on the field. You are encouraged to actively share your findings and recommendations through scientific papers and conferences, but also through channels such as blog posts, social media, and news outlets. We welcome active discussion and invite criticism on our work.
We strongly value open science: among other things, we encourage preregistration, sharing of data and materials, and we facilitate open access publication.
Beside research, you will also contribute to the teaching tasks within the department.

Background
The past 10 years have been a time of reflection for psychology. Many key findings could not be replicated, which led to the question: how trustworthy is psychological research? Research from the last decade has pointed to a combination of publication pressure and publication bias, questionable research practices, and lack of transparency (among other things) as the cause for this “replication crisis”.
We are now at the point where we can shift our focus to solutions: can we implement interventions that make research findings in psychology more reproducible and replicable? Many interventions have been suggested already in various contexts: training (of students and researchers), recognition and rewards, funding, and more. In this project we will focus on interventions in the publication system (e.g., preregistration, open science badges, TOP guidelines, statistical checks). It is encouraging to see the growing list of initiatives, but we need more empirical research to assess which interventions actually work.

Your qualifications
We have the following requirements:
A (nearly finished) (Research) Master’s degree in psychology or a related field
A strong background in methodology and statistics
Experience with programming
Tilburg University is an international university, firmly rooted in the region and therefore bilingual. We expect our employees to meet the language level appropriate for the position. For academics, an excellent command of English is required: CEFR level C2.

In addition, we value curiosity and creative thinking. Many proposed interventions still fall neatly within the current academic system and publication framework. It is possible that effective interventions fall outside these confinements. You are encouraged to take this possibility into account in your work and challenge your supervisors with new ideas, theories, methods, and tools.

Our offer
This is a position for 1.0 FTE (40 hours per week) of the full-time working week.
The salary amounts to a minimum of €2.541 and a maximum of €3.247 gross per month for full time employment contract, based on UFO profile PhD student and salary scale number PhD’s of the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities. Tilburg University uses a neutral salary system for scaling that is based on relevant education and work experience.
You are entitled to a vacation allowance of 8% and a year-end bonus of 8.3% of your gross annual income. If you work 40 hours per week, you will receive 41 paid days of leave per year.
Tilburg University offers excellent employment conditions. We think flexibility, professional and personal development, and good employee benefits important. We make clear agreements about career paths and offer all kinds of facilities and schemes to maintain an optimal balance between work and private life. You can also follow numerous training courses, for example in the areas of leadership skills, personal effectiveness, and career development.
Tilburg University values an open and inclusive culture. We embrace diversity and encourage the mutual integration of groups of employees and students. We focus on creating equal opportunities for all our employees and students, so that everyone feels at home in our university community.
Tilburg University has a lively campus in beautiful green surroundings that is easily accessible by public transport. We are committed to a sustainable society and challenge you to make an active contribution.
Please visit working at Tilburg University for more information on our terms of employment.

How does a waiter at a restaurant know what we mean when we point to an empty glass, and how did we learn to select that particular gesture? As a research assistant, you will help organise a longitudinal study in pre-school children to help understand human communication and how it develops.

This project builds on the notion that social experiences early in life are crucial for the development of human communication skills. The project uses natural variability in early life social experiences as a tool to understand how different sociocultural environments guide the development of human communicative capacities. We plan to test long-lasting effects of those experiences on the human ability to communicate. The specific goal of the project is to identify which features of children's sociocultural environment influence their ability to coordinate with other people later in development. We are looking for a MSc interested in organising an ambitious real-life longitudinal study involving pre-school children. The study will use wearable audio-recording devices to measure the interactions of 3- to 4-year-old children during their time in day care (e.g. over the course of a week). The project is embedded in the research groups of Prof. Ivan Toni, Prof. Sabine Hunnius, and Dr Marlene Meyer at the Donders Institute, combining expertise in social neurocognition, experimental semiotics, and developmental neurocognition.
Profile
You have an MSc degree in psychology, educational sciences, or (cognitive) neuroscience, with hands-on experience in experimental testing of young children.
Fluency in written/spoken Dutch is required.
Given the interdisciplinary of the research setting, you should have a strong collaborative attitude and a proven ability to work in a team.
You will be responsible for planning and implementing a project quantifying children's interactions in a naturalistic setting. The position also involves supervision of a dedicated student assistant.
You will take the lead in coordinating the implementation of the research project in collaboration with the PIs.
The Donders Institute values a diverse workforce. Female candidates are therefore particularly encouraged to apply.
We are

We are looking for two PhD candidates to study achievement inequality from a developmental-psychological perspective. Achievement inequality is one of the most defining problems of our time. Around the world, children from low socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds underperform in school relative to children from higher SES backgrounds, even when they have the same level of ability.

This project, funded by an NWO Vidi grant awarded to Eddie Brummelman, studies the critical role of children’s self-views in achievement inequality. The project examines why children from lower SES backgrounds often develop negative views of themselves and their abilities, and how these negative self-views can perpetuate socioeconomic disparities in educational achievement and mental health. To do so, this project will focus on the transactions between children and their teachers.

The overarching project consist of two research projects:

In research project 1, the first PhD candidate will conduct real-life observations and experimental studies on teacher-child interactions. The goal is to identify whether and how teachers provide differential treatment to children from lower versus higher SES backgrounds.

In research project 2, the second PhD candidate will conduct virtual reality (VR) experiments in virtual classrooms. The goal is to identify the causal effects of teachers’ differential treatment on children’s self-views, motivation, and achievement.

Across projects 1 and 2, the candidates will together conduct a longitudinal measurement burst study in a socioeconomically diverse sample. The goal is to examine how teacher-chid interactions shape children’s self-views, motivation, and achievement across the transition from elementary to secondary school.

The PhD project will be part of Eddie Brummelman’s lab group, which is part of the Developmental Psychopathology programme group of the Research Institute of Child Development and Education at the University of Amsterdam.

Both projects are 5-year projects, each for 30.4 hours per week (0.8fte). The expected starting date is July 1, 2023, or September 1, 2023.

What are you going to do

We are looking for two PhD students to study the developing self and achievement inequality.

Your primary tasks will be:
Designing and conducting studies on the developing self and achievement inequality in childhood;
Integrating theories and methods from various disciplines, including developmental psychology, social psychology, pedagogics, and sociology;
Using advanced statistical methods to process and analyze data;
Writing international peer-reviewed scientific papers;
Working in a collaborative team to improve one another’s research;
Presenting your work at conferences for academics, policy makers, and educators.

What do you have to offer

We are looking for two dedicated candidates who are eager to conduct basic research on the psychology of achievement inequality in childhood. The candidates must thrive in a collaborative environment that calls for autonomy, creativity, and persistence. Also, they must be interested in combining insights from various disciplines.

Your experience and profile:
You hold a master’s degree in psychology, pedagogics, sociology, educational science, or an associated field;
You have experience with or interest in quantitative research, preferably involving children;
You are motivated to design and conduct your own quantitative research;
You have excellent quantitative data-analysis skills;
You have excellent writing and presentation skills.

For project 1 (but not project 2), we are looking for a candidate who is fluent in Dutch, because this project will involve analyzing interactions between Dutch-speaking teachers and children. For both projects, we expect the candidate to have excellent English language skills.
What can we offer you

The position concerns temporary employment of 30.4 hours per week for a maximum term of 5 years. The initial employment is for one year. Following a positive assessment and barring altered circumstances, this term will be extended by a maximum of 48 months, which should result in the conferral of a doctorate. We will put together a curriculum which will also include the opportunity to attend training courses and both national and international events. You will also be tasked with teaching Bachelor's students.
Your salary will be € 2.541,00 gross per month in the first year and will increase to € 3.247,00 in the final 2 years, based on full-time employment and in keeping with the Collective Labour Agreement of Dutch Universities. We additionally offer an extensive package of secondary benefits, including 8% holiday allowance and a year-end bonus of 8.3%.

The UvA offers excellent possibilities for further professional development and education.

Are you eager to uncover how technology and AI can be implemented at work to help employees learn at work and perform more efficiently? Are you interested in how high-risk professionals, such as those working for the military and the police, respond to new technology at work? Is it your ambition to achieve impact based on systematic and evidence-based research? Do you like a challenging and independent job in a dynamic setting in close collaboration with the Dutch military? In this joint research project with TNO and the Ministry of Defense, the department of Work and Organizational Psychology of the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences is looking for a PhD student on “Rethinking the Workplace: How Technological Innovations Can Improve Employability and Efficiency”.

Project description
Technological innovations, including artificial intelligence, robotization, VR/AR and data analytics are rapidly transforming the workplace. These technological developments promise increased efficiency, sustainable employability and better decision-making: much-needed outcomes in a continuously changing and increasingly tight labor market. However, without careful consideration of employee needs, motivation and well-being, such technological innovations can backfire and threaten the quality and continuance of people’s jobs. In this PhD project, we aim to uncover how technological innovations can help to redesign jobs in such a way that they optimize individual employability and development, as well as organizational efficiency. We argue that this can only be realized if high-risk professionals are willing and able to adopt and implement the new technology, and, hence, that they should be included as active agents in the adoption of technology.

The PhD project aims to answer the following research questions using a multi-disciplinary and multi-level approach, combining organizational psychological principles with the principles of human-centered social innovation:
Which work characteristics (work design) help/hinder employee attitudes toward (the use of) new technology?
How can we deploy technology to (re-)organize work in such a way that it stimulates learning, employability and (organizational) efficiency?
How does the work environment (organizational culture, socio-economic conditions) influence the impact of technology and work design on employee efficiency?

The University of Amsterdam and TNO collaborate on this PhD project. You will be based at the Work and Organizational Psychology Research Group of the Psychology Research Institute at the Faculty of Social and Behavioral Sciences, working under the supervision of Dr Matthijs Baas (UvA), Dr Jessie Koen (UvA/TNO Healthy Living & Work) and Dr Esther Oprins (TNO Defense, Security & Safety). In addition, you are expected to occasionally work at TNO (Soesterberg).

What you are going to do
Together with the University and TNO, you will carry out an interdisciplinary research program dedicated to stimulating the employability and efficiency of high-risk professionals such as the military workforce in the Netherlands. With your research, you will contribute to a sustainable workforce that is ready to cope with digital and technological transitions.
Within the PhD project, your activities will include data collection using various methods (e.g., multi-level survey studies, daily diary and intervention studies), (systematic) literature review. You will analyze data and write articles for scientific publication. Based on research findings, you will also present relevant outcomes to a military audience from the Dutch Military of Defense or international communities such as NATO. You will also closely collaborate with TNO colleagues, participating in research program ‘Arbeidsextensivering’ for the Ministry of Defense. In addition to conducting research, you will be involved in teaching activities (15% of the time) in the teaching program of work and organizational psychology (e.g., supervision of thesis research of students, tutoring working groups).

What do you have to offer
We are looking for a candidate that:
has (or is within 3 months of obtaining) a university master’s degree in the field of psychology, HR, behavioral economics, or a related discipline in the social sciences; a degree in Work and Organizational Psychology or Organizational Behavior/ HRM is a plus;
is enthusiastic, motivated, driven, conscientious and independent;
has (proven) knowledge of, and experience with, quantitative (field) research;
has excellent methodological and statistical skills;
has excellent oral and written communication skills in Dutch and English;
has affinity with the military and/or other high-risk work environments;
likes to work in a team and knows how to manage interests of different stakeholders;

has a passion for applied research and the application of research findings in practice; is prepared to engage in teaching activities, such as the supervision of thesis research of university students and the tutoring of working groups;
As you will be working in the domain of defense and security, a Certificate of No Objection issued by AIVD (The Dutch General Information and Security Service) is mandatory. This means you will have to undergo a security screening. Read more about security screening.

What can we offer you
The position concerns temporary employment of 38 hours per week for a maximum term of 4 years. The initial employment is for one year. Following a positive assessment and barring altered circumstances, this term will be extended by a maximum of 36 months, which should result in the conferral of a doctorate. We will put together a curriculum which will also include the opportunity to attend training courses and both national and international events. You will also be tasked with teaching Bachelor's students.

The Faculty of Law, Institute for Information Law (IViR), and the University Research Priority Area on Trust in the Digital Society (TRUST RPA: https://www.ivir.nl/trust-in-the-digital-society-new-uva-research-priority-area/ ) is looking for a postdoctoral researcher to study the institutional safeguards of trustworthy centralized and decentralized techno-social infrastructures.

The TRUST RPA is a five year long interdisciplinary research initiative to study how we trust is changing due to the emergence of new trust production technologies, and the disruption of existing trust relations.

The digital society relies on an ever-expanding network of digital infrastructures. This forces us to rethink some of our basic assumptions about one of the most fundamental resources in all interpersonal, social, economic relations: trust.
Despite their widespread use, we know little about the trustworthiness of our digital infrastructures. At best it is difficult to establish their trustworthiness (such as with AI), at worst they are proven to be untrustworthy (as is the case with social media).
Some of these digital infrastructures play key roles in interpersonal and societal trust dynamics. They disrupt existing trust relations and offer new ways to trust each other.
Our scientific methods and theories face serious limits when it comes to the study of change of social structures, institutions, and processes under the conditions of rapid technological transformation. Research on trust in technology and trust by technology is siloed, and focuses on narrowly defined technologies (AI), or problems (system security), and lacks a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, long-term-view.

This postdoctoral position (embedded in the TRUST RPA, supervised by both the Institute for Information Law, at the Amsterdam Law School, and at least one other participating faculty) will use empirical research to study how various new technological infrastructures disrupt or can enhance existing societal (impersonal, institutional) trust relations and strive to establish new forms of trust relations in society.

What are you going to do?

 The successful candidate will:
Conduct empirical, qualitative research (interviews, case studies, discourse analysis) on the dynamics of institutional, impersonal trust with regards to emerging digital technologies, such as digital platforms, web3 technologies, or Machine Learning based automated systems.
Coordinate the development, fieldwork and initial analysis of a large-scale longitudinal survey
Conduct work on the emerging European technology regulation framework (Digital Services Act, AI Act, Digital Markets Act) using doctrinal research, normative research and discourse analysis
Organize events, conferences
Participate in grant proposal development, international network building
Acquiree funding

The Postdoctoral researcher will be hired by the Faculty of Law, closely collaborating with two other postdoctoral researchers in the Trust RPA. The team will be supervised by the PIs of the TRUS RPA: Balazs Bodo, Associate Professor at the Institute of Information Law (IViR) at the Faculty of Law, Jan B. Engelmann, Professor of Neuroeconomics at the Amsterdam School of Economics, Theo Araujo, Associate Professor Communication in the Digital Society at the Amsterdam School of Communication Research (ASCoR), Tom van Engers, Professor in Legal Knowledge Management at the University of Amsterdam, and Marc Tuters, Assistant Professor in the New Media and Digital Culture Division of Media Studies at the Faculty of Humanities.

What do we require of you?

 The successful candidate has:
a PhD degree in law, or social sciences (sociology, economics, political science, communication science, science and technology studies or related fields)
strong empirical research skills;
familiarity with qualitative research methods,
familiarity with doctrinal research or policy research;
good knowledge of current developments in information markets and technology;
academic excellence, as shown in the grade transcripts and curriculum vitae.
a creative mind and analytical intelligence;
an interest in working in a multidisciplinary team;
willingness to learn new knowledge, and acquire new skills required by the project;
excellent written and spoken command of English, and ideally knowledge of Dutch
interest in working on interdisciplinary topics, in interdisciplinary teams.

Candidates, who have:
quantitative skills, including survey development, statistical analysis, and/or
familiarity with R, python or any other programming language, and/or
big data collection and analysis skills, and/or
previous experience in the private or public sector

will be given extra consideration in the application process.

We strongly encourage members of broadly understood minority socio-cultural groups to apply. We believe that there are several traditionally underrepresented, but incredibly forceful perspectives, that have transformed our respective disciplines. Recent scholarship by persons of colour, feminist, intersectionalist scholars, scholars from the Global South have highlighted fundamental issues with the design, operation, and impact of techno-social systems that remained in the blind spots of mainstream scholarship. Without such contributions, serious problems, such as racial bias in AI systems, would have gone unnoticed and left unaddressed by more careful technical design and better regulation.

Our offer

We offer a temporary employment contract for 38 hours per week for a period of 36 months with a probationary period of two months. The preferred starting date is as soon possible.
The gross monthly salary, based on 30,4 -38 (0.8-1 FTE) hours per week and dependent on relevant experience, ranges between € 2,960 to € 4,670 (scale 10). UvA additionally offers an extensive package of secondary benefits, including 8% holiday allowance and a year-end bonus of 8.3%. The UFO profile Researcher 4 is applicable. A favourable tax agreement, the ‘30% ruling’, may apply to non-Dutch applicants. The Collective Labour Agreement of Universities of the Netherlands is applicable.

Besides the salary and a vibrant and challenging environment we offer you multiple fringe benefits:
232 holiday hours per year (based on fulltime) and extra holidays between Christmas and 1 January;
Multiple courses to follow from our Teaching and Learning Centre;
Multiple courses on topics such as leadership for academic staff;
Multiple courses on topics such as time management, handling stress and an online learning platform with 100+ different courses;
7 weeks birth leave (partner leave) with 100% salary;
Partly paid parental leave;
The possibility to set up a workplace at home;
A pension at ABP for which UvA pays two third part of the contribution;
The possibility to follow courses to learn Dutch;

What else do we offer
the possibility to start up and grow a New Research priority Area at the UvA,
close working relations with five faculties of the UvA; and with TU Delft, and Erasmus University, Rotterdam
freedom to develop your own research agenda;
welcoming, international, dynamic teams;
an inspiring academic and professional environment in the heart of Amsterdam;
excellent possibilities for further professional development and education.

"PhD student on the topic of Social Motives in Coalition Formation (full-time, 4 years)","The department of Social Psychology at Tilburg University has a vacancy for a PhD student on the topic of Social Motives in Coalition Formation (full-time, 4 years)

Project description
The PhD project is part of Compose 3, a multidisciplinary collaboration between Tilburg University and evofenedex with a focus on the logistics sector and its transition into a sustainable or net-zero footprint industry. The contribution of the PhD project is to study the social motives that are important for sustainable coalition formation. These include both trait-like factors such as personality traits, social-cognitive abilities, social preferences, social value orientation or emotion proneness (e.g., fear, greed) and situational factors, such as framing, reputation, sanctions, different incentive structures, and defaults. The goal of the project is to identify which factors contribute to the creation of sustainable coalitions, next to financial incentives that are studied in Economics. The project will achieve its goals by both analyzing secondary data (e.g., through the LISS panel, https://www.lissdata.nl/) and by designing experimental studies of social dilemmas that reflect the type of decisions that have to be made by actors in the logistics sector. As such, the project strives to both increase our theoretical understanding of social motives in coalition formation and to create societal impact by contributing to more sustainable decision making in the logistics sector.

Compose 3 is staffed by a consortium consisting of Tilburg University, evofenedex, Smart Freight Centre and Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences. Most of the research will be conducted by the Tilburg University team by means of two PhD tracks. One at the departments of Econometrics and Operations Research, and one at the Department of Social Psychology. In addition, Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences will develop educational material and with evofenedex and Smart Freight Centre we have two strong organisations in our consortium that provide access to a large group of interested companies.

Job description

PhD Active and passive states in human working memory,"The University of Groningen is a research university with a global outlook, deeply rooted in Groningen, City of Talent. Quality has had top priority for four hundred years, and with success: the University is currently in or around the top 100 on several influential ranking lists.

The Faculty of Behavioural and Social Sciences excels in teaching and research in the fields of human behaviour, thinking, learning, and how people live together. The Faculty of Behavioural and Social Sciences employs over 800 staff members. Within the Faculty, the Department of Psychology offers Bachelor’s and Master’s programs in both Dutch and English to over 3,000 students. Our department's student population is very international; more than half of our students are non-Dutch.

The group of Experimental Psychology pursues a research program focused on the cognitive underpinnings of human behaviour, as well as their neurophysiological correlates. We teach in the Psychology Bachelor program, and also in the top-rated Behavioural and Cognitive Neurosciences (BCN) Research Master, the Computational Cognitive Science Master, and the Applied Cognitive Neuroscience Master.

This PhD project focuses on how the brain maintains information in working memory. This short-term store of information is vital to adaptive, intelligent behaviour. For long it was assumed that working memory is implemented by persistent neural activity; by neurons that keep firing in order to keep the maintained information active. However, more recent work has demonstrated that information can also be maintained in an activity-silent way involving short-term synaptic plasticity. Yet, the functional role of these silent mechanisms is unknown. In this project, using a novel impulse-perturbation technique that is able to illuminate activity-silent states using EEG, you will investigate 1) whether there are functional differences to information that is maintained using persistent-activity or in an activity-silent way, and 2) what the advantages are of having two different ways to code memories. These studies will provide a more detailed account of how working memory supports intelligent behaviour in- and outside the laboratory.

The tasks of the PhD candidate are:
conduct research that results in a dissertation, in line with the objectives and requirements of the projectorganize and execute the data collection for the different studiespublish the results of the research in international scientific journalspresent the research findings to fellow scientists and developerscollaborate with other team membersprovide a limited amount of teaching at the Psychology department, such as small-scale tutorials, guest lectures and student supervision, in collaboration with the supervisors.

PhD position ‘Examining and treating prolonged grief in daily life’,"Key takeaways
Hours
38 hr.
Salary indication
Salary gross/monthly
based on full-time
€ 2,541
Deadline
1 May 2023

Prolonged grief disorder is a debilitating condition, affecting 10% of bereaved people. To date, studies evaluating treatments for prolonged grief have focused on symptom change on a group-level, ignoring individual variability in grief responses.

Personalized prolonged grief treatment may enhance treatment outcomes. An assumption underlying personalized care is that people respond differently to treatment. In part 1 of this project, you will test this assumption by examining distinct trajectories in treatment responses, and correlates thereof, using a novel data-archive. This data-archive consists of existing individual patient data of randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy for prolonged grief disorder (PGD).

Moreover, in order to personalize PGD treatment we need to know to what specific intervention might be helpful for this particular person in what certain moment. A precondition for this personalized treatment approach is that the topic of interest is dynamic and context-dependent. While theoretical and anecdotal work supports that this is the case for PGD, you will be the first to provide an empirical base supporting these claims in part 2 of the project, using experience sampling methodology (ESM). In part 3 of the project, you will create, together with experts and bereaved people, an ESM-based personalized intervention for treatment of PGD using qualitative research methods. In a pilot-study you will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and potential effectiveness of this ESM-based personalized PGD intervention.

As a result of this project, you will contribute in three ways to personalized treatment for prolonged grief, by:

improving the understanding of differences in responses to treatment for prolonged grief;
gaining novel insights in how grief unfolds in daily life;
offering dynamic support in daily life to treat prolonged grief.
You will harmonize and then analyze existing data from randomized controlled trials using latent variable modelling (part 1). Together with master-students you will collect ESM-data (part 2), which you will analyze using multi-level modelling. In close collaboration with scientist-practitioners and bereaved people you will co-create and evaluate a smart-phone app to reduce PGD using qualitative and quantitative research methods (part 3). You will report your findings in academic peer-reviewed journals as well as media outlets for non-academic audiences and you will present your work at (inter)national conferences. Collaborations with national and international colleagues are part of this project. You will be a member of existing research groups that focus on grief and ESM that organize regular meetings to exchange experiences/knowledge in an informal setting with peers.

Your profile
You have a completed master’s degree in psychology or a related field at the preferred start date and you have affinity with clinical psychology and technology
You have experience and affinity with both quantitative and qualitative research methods and analytical thinking is one of your core strengths
You are proactive, have great people skills, and have a 'getting things done' mentality
You have a good team spirit and like to work in an interdisciplinary and internationally oriented environment
You are proficient in English. Possessing good Dutch language skills is an advantage, because study materials are in Dutch
Our offer
A full-time position for four years, with a qualifier in the first year, and the flexibility to work (partially) from home
You will receive a gross monthly salary ranging from € 2.541 (first year) to € 3.247,- (fourth year)
There are excellent benefits including a holiday allowance of 8% of the gross annual salary, an end-of-year bonus of 8.3%, and a solid pension scheme
A minimum of 232 leave hours in case of full-time employment based on a formal workweek of 38 hours. A full-time employment in practice means 40 hours a week, therefore resulting in 96 extra leave hours on an annual basis
Free access to sports facilities on campus
A family-friendly institution that offers parental leave (both paid and unpaid)
You will have a training programme as part of the Twente Graduate School where you and your supervisors will determine a plan for a suitable education and supervision
The University offers a dynamic ecosystem with enthusiastic colleagues
We encourage a high degree of responsibility and independence, but also stimulate interaction and discussion with colleagues

"PhD Positions in Cognitive Neuroscience: ""The Neural Basis of Consciousness""","2 PhD Positions in Cognitive Neuroscience: ""The Neural Basis of Consciousness""
Faculteit/Dienst: Faculteit der Maatschappij- & Gedragswetenschappen
Opleidingsniveau: Master
Functie type: Promotieplaats
Sluitingsdatum: 20 May 2023
Vacaturenummer: 11362
We are looking for two highly qualified and motivated PhD candidates in Cognitive Neuroscience. The two positions are part of an ERC consolidator grant titled “Towards understanding human consciousness: How internal brain states and environmental context shape our subjective experience”. Both PhD positions are embedded in the Conscious brain lab, and the projects will be supervised by dr. Simon van Gaal and colleagues. The conscious brain lab consists of several PhD students, postdoctoral researchers and staff members of the Brain and Cognition department (department of Psychology) of the UvA who all study the neural basis of conscious and/or related topics (see website for details).

The two projects
Project 1: What makes us experience the world around us consciously? We do not become conscious of all inputs that reach our senses at every point in time: much processing goes on “under the radar”. The aim of this project is to elucidate the neurochemical basis of conscious experience and to dissociate it from unconscious processes. Conscious experience will be manipulated in several ways (e.g., masking, rivalry) and different pharmaceutical agents are given to healthy human participants (on different days) while they are performing experimental tasks in which consciousness is manipulated. Pharmacological manipulations target GABAergic and Glutamatergic functioning to impede inhibitory and excitatory neural processes that are hypothesized to be important for conscious experience. EEG and fMRI will be used to measure the effects of these pharmacological interventions on neural processes indicative of feedforward, horizontal and feedback processing in the human brain.
Project 2: While studying consciousness, it is increasingly recognized that the goal to control as many “confounding factors” in lab experiments comes at a price. That is, in real life, conscious experience is not created in a controlled vacuum, but it is determined by internal spontaneous fluctuations in arousal and (responses to) external changes in environmental context. In this project we address how fluctuations in arousal and physical activity of the body (also referred to as “brain state”) may shape sensory build-up of stimulus representations and hence conscious experience. Arousal fluctuations are measured when they fluctuate spontaneously using pupil size. However, arousal will also be manipulated by changes in physical activity of the body (e.g., by inducing drowsiness or active states in participants) and pharmacological intervention (up- and down regulating arousal). EEG and fMRI will be used to measure the neural effects of these manipulations and their impact on conscious experience.

Because in these projects pharmacological interventions are performed, one of the two candidates should be fluent in Dutch to be able to communicate well with the participants (in Dutch) (explaining/evaluating exclusion criteria etc.).
What are you going to do

complete and defend a PhD thesis within the official appointment duration of four years;
gain knowledge of the field through literature survey, discussion with team members, and internal lab meetings;
contribute to the design of experiments and perform experiments;
analyse and interpret results of experiments;
present data at local, national and international scientific meetings;
assist in teaching undergraduates and Master’s students and co-supervise junior scientists (technicians, MSc/BSc students).
What do you have to offer
You are passionate about cognitive (neuro)science and interested in consciousness or related topics such as perception and decision making. You enjoy working in a diverse setting, as you will be working in a collaborative project. You are a team player and a nice colleague with good communication skills as you will regularly join and present at lab meetings as well as at relevant (inter)national meetings.
Your experience and profile:
MSc (preferably research master) in Experimental Psychology, (Cognitive) Neuroscience or related fields;
Good and demonstrable skills in coding in either python, R, or Matlab;
Good analytical, writing and presenting skills;
Good project and time management skills enabling you to meet the projects’ deadlines for finishing analyses, reports and other deliverables;
Eager to learn new things, high conscientiousness, flexibility, and a collaborative attitude;
Fluency in English, both written and spoken;
Preferably in depth knowledge about the topic of consciousness or related topics such as (visual) perception, attention and perceptual decision making;
Preferably experience with data acquisition techniques such as eye-tracking fMRI, or EEG;
Preferably experience with neuroimaging (e.g., EEG and fMRI) data analyses (e.g., decoding analyses, network analyses);
Preferably experience with computational modelling (e.g., drift diffusion models).

What can we offer you

A temporary contract for 38 hours per week for the duration of 4 years (the initial contract will be for a period of 12 months and after satisfactory evaluation it will be extended to a total duration of 4 years). The preferred starting date is between 1 September 2023 and 1 January 2024. This should lead to a dissertation (PhD thesis). We will draft an educational plan that includes attendance of courses and (international) meetings. We also expect you to assist in teaching undergraduates and master students.

Your salary will range between €2541 in the first year to €3247 gross per month in the last year of employment, on the basis of a full working week of 38 hours. This sum does not include the 8% holiday allowance and the 8.3% year-end allowance. A favorable tax agreement, the 30% ruling, may apply to non-Dutch applicants. The Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities (CAO NU) is applicable.
Besides the salary and a vibrant and challenging environment at the Psychology department and specifically the program group Brain and Cognition, we offer you multiple fringe benefits:
232 holiday hours per year (based on fulltime);
multiple courses to follow from our Teaching and Learning Centre;
a pension at ABP for which UvA pays two third part of the contribution;
the possibility to follow courses to learn Dutch;
help with housing for a studio or small apartment when you’re moving from abroad.

Description of the study

Various ethnic minority groups have an increased risk of psychosis compared to the majority group. The underlying mechanism is largely unknown. A possible underlying mechanism is “stress sensitization”, meaning that the repeated exposure to negative experiences leads to a stronger response to new stressors. Stress sensitization can be observed at the behavioural, cognitive and neural level. In this Veni project we investigate in healthy adolescents whether the excess psychosis risk in ethic minorities can be explained by stress sensitization at one of these levels. As PhD candidate you will recruit adolescents for an experimental behavioural and an fMRI study and conduct analyses with the collected data.

You coordinate the data collection of the behavioural and the fMRI study and recruit adolescents in a team of research assistants and MSc students
You scan participants at the Spinoza Centre for Neuroimaging
You are involved in processing the data and analysing the outcomes
You write at least four research papers on the study findings that reflect the basis of your PhD thesis
You disseminate the study findings through conference presentations and publications
In addition, we provide an intensive educational and development program with courses in ethics, research integrity, methods and techniques and academic writing.
Requirements
You have the ambition to do a PhD, are eager to learn and have a desire to further develop your skills and talents
You have a completed university (research) master's degree in psychology, neurosciences, health sciences, or a related field;
You have experience and/or professional expertise in the field of fMRI and/or mental health
You have excellent quantitative research skills as demonstrated by high grades for methods and statistics courses, a good evaluation of your (research) master thesis and, if applicable, a scientific publication
You have experience or interest in fMRI analyses and are able or willing to learn to work in R or Stata
You have an excellent level of English (written and spoken) and you speak sufficient Dutch to be able to recruit participants
You have excellent communicative, planning and organizational skill
What are we offering?
A challenging position in a socially involved organization. The salary will be in accordance with university regulations for academic personnel and amounts €2,541 (scale 85-0) per month during the first year and increases to €3,247 (scale 85-3) per month during the fourth year, based on a full-time employment.

The appointment will initially be one yea r . After a satisfactory evaluation of the initial appointment, the contract will be extended to a total duration of 4 years. After 4 years the PhD position will end in a PhD dissertation.


Additionally, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam offers excellent fringe benefits and various schemes and regulations to promote a good work/life balance, such as:
8% holiday allowance and 8.3% end-of-year bonus;
a wide range of sports facilities which staff may use at a modest charge;

PhD vacancy: Human-Centered Networked Care,"About the project
In orthopedic care many disciplines are involved before, during and after the orthopedic intervention. Interventions range from surgical to non- treatment, including physiotherapy, pain medications, and a splint or brace prescription. Where care traditionally is organised to optimize professional efficiency for each discipline separately, this may hamper the overall quality, experience, value and flow of care for the patient. The purpose of this project is to develop knowledge for the design and implementation of networked care in orthopedics, and will focus on hand-wrist orthopaedics in particular. Besides diagnosing, treating acquired hand and wrist pathology is challenging. Concerning instability and complaints in the wrist there is an international debate in progress, in which two main streams are right to each other.
Diagnosing and treatment based on imaging and invasive diagnostics measurement
Diagnosing and treatment based on psychosocial patient characteristics
In this human-centered project, the requirements from a sociotechnical system’s perspective are taken as a starting point, taking both streams into account, with the various actors (i.e. patient, caregiver, health professionals, employers) in the network able to add value for the patient at different moments.

About the role
The goals of the project will be achieved through: (1) Investigating the needs, values, facilitators and barriers of all stakeholders involved in networked orthopedic care, by using human-centered design and human factors research techniques (i.e. a sociotechnical system perspective including stakeholder mapping, context mapping and patient journey mapping). (2) Developing a theoretical framework for networked care in orthopedics and identify opportunities for digital support; and (3) Developing, prototyping and evaluating support for networked care in orthopedics.
This PhD will result in knowledge of contextual challenges and information needs for the implementation of networked care in orthopedics, an evaluated proposal for the implementation of networked care in othopedics, and guidance for designers, end-users and policy makers on the implementation of networked care in orthopedics.

Profile
You should have:
an undergraduate degree in design, human factors, psychology or a related discipline;
hold, or nearing completion of, a Masters degree in industrial design, psychology, or a related discipline;
evidence of experience in qualitative research methods;
prior paid or voluntary work experience;
evidence of excellent communication and organisational skills;
prior experience in conducting implementation research in health care would also be an advantage;
good level of English and Dutch (written and oral);
applicants must meet the MSCA Eligibility Criteria, see the Tools4Teams Recruitment process for more information.
Our offer
This PhD position is funded by the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) of the European Union’s “Horizon Europe 2022” research and innovation program under grant agreement No 101072843. You will be appointed as fulltime PhD for 4 years at the Amsterdam UMC in the Netherlands. The MSCA programme offers competitive and attractive working conditions. The successful candidates will receive a salary in accordance with the MSCA regulations for doctoral candidates. Gross salary will consist of a Living Allowance (= €40.800/year, correction factor to be applied for The Netherlands: 1.09) and a monthly Mobility Allowance of €600. An additional monthly allowance of €660 is applicable depending on family situation. For Marie Skłodowska-Curie doctoral candidates in the Netherlands, the level of the living allowance plus mobility allowance is typically equal to or slightly lower than the obligatory minimum salary level for PhDs according to Dutch law. Please be aware that these amounts are subject to taxes, the exact salary will be confirmed upon appointment. The research project should result in a PhD thesis.

About the workplace
You will join the Research section Quality and Organisation of Care at the Department of Public and Occupational Health at the Amsterdam University Medical Center and will collaborate closely with the Department of Human-Centered Design of the Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering at Technical University of Delft. The research will be embedded in the Quality of Care program of the Amsterdam Public Health research institute, offering a strong multidisciplinary research network and facilities.
You will complete two secondments during your studies. The second year starts with a three month secondment at the company Caresharing, to work on iterative design of the tailored information integration platform for transmural elderly care teams. In the third year, a three months secondment follows at Valide AS in Stavanger (Norway) to obtain insight in cross-national differences is challenges and use of support tools for transmural elderly care teams.
AmsterdamUMC is part of an EU-funded doctoral network, “Tools4Teams” that investigates different instruments and tools to support teamwork in different parts of the healthcare system. Tools are technical as well as procedural. The network allows the various PhD candidates in a variety of European countries to meet and to learn with and from each other and the collective group of PhD supervisors.

PhD (Quantum) Data Governance and the Law of Sensing and Measurement,"PhD (Quantum) Data Governance and the Law of Sensing and Measurement
Faculteit/Dienst: Faculteit der Rechtsgeleerdheid
Opleidingsniveau: Master
Functie type: Promotieplaats
Sluitingsdatum: 24.04.2023
Vacaturenummer: 11243
Do you want to contribute to a vision on how to address new sensing capabilities of 21st century digital infrastructures in data governance law? And do you want to study one of the core legal and governance questions with respect to quantum technologies?

This PhD position on (Quantum) Data Governance and the Law of Sensing and Measurement is part of the new research group on the law and governance of quantum technologies at the Institute for Information Law, University of Amsterdam. The Institute for Information Law is one of the largest research facilities in information law world-wide. The Institute brings together more than 40 researchers from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds. The research group is a part of Action line 4 on the Ethical, Legal And Societal Aspects of Quantum Technologies of the Quantum Delta NL ecosystem.

What are you going to do

Over the last years, public and private investment in quantum technologies, including quantum computing, communications and sensing, have received a significant boost. Quantum computing has been the most eye catching in the quantum tech innovation landscape. It promises, when fully realized, to add additional special-purpose computational capacity to our current-day digital infrastructure. The advancement of quantum sensing technologies has proceeded with less fanfare, despite more advanced technology-readiness and wide possible application areas. Quantum sensing technologies promise to enhance digital infrastructures in ways that may have significant societal implications.

Measurement and sensing, including the establishment of standards and the collection of digital data in socio-technical settings, is a core function of current-day digital infrastructures. Through sensing, digital infrastructure facilitates processes of capture. This can be capture of operations, of behavior, and of environments, each creating new possibilities for control and governance in the process. Innovations in quantum sensing technologies may reconfigure such possibilities of capture in new ways.

Taking the increasing entanglement of law and digital infrastructure as a starting point, this PhD project will engage with the following questions. What are some of the unique legal challenges that quantum sensing applications may create in light of current information law, fundamental rights (including the right to private life and data protection)? Do some of the unique properties of quantum information (such as the possibility of entanglement and no cloning) and particular quantum sensing and metrology applications call into question the relation of law to information and data, as it has developed over the last decades? How can law support the beneficial and responsible use of quantum sensing applications while addressing such legal challenges? What challenges do disruptive sensing technologies pose for the law-infrastructure relationship? And finally, how should law respond to the dual-use nature of certain quantum sensing applications and contribute to the proper balance between the different societal interests implicated by quantum sensing technologies?

The PhD project will be part of the research group on the Law and Governance of Quantum Technologies at the Institute for Information Law (IViR) at the Faculty of Law of the University of Amsterdam. You will conduct original cutting-edge research into the law and governance of quantum technologies, quantum sensing technologies in particular. You will develop new insights into the specific legal implications of particular quantum sensing applications. And using legal theory, information law and other relevant disciplines, and while engaging with relevant stakeholders, you will contribute to our understanding of the relation between law and digital infrastructures today and in the quantum age.

What do we require

a completed degree in law, or equivalent degree;
affinity with questions of data governance and a knowledgeable curiosity for developments in quantum technologies;
good knowledge of current regulatory developments with respect to digital infrastructure and cloud computing;
excellent academic credentials, as demonstrated by grades and/or curriculum vitae;
a creative mind and strong critical and analytical skills;
an interest in working across legal disciplines, using different methods (including empirical, theoretical and interdisciplinary), and collaborations with other relevant non-legal disciplines;
strong communication skills and a commitment to contributing to diverse and inclusive team dynamics;
excellent language skills in English and one or more other languages;

If the vacancy appeals to you, but you are doubting whether you might be THE person we are looking for, please do apply. We particularly welcome applications from candidates from underrepresented backgrounds.
