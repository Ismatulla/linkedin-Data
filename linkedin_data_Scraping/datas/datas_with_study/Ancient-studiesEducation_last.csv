About the Role

TEP Social Studies Teachers guide our students to be detectives of history. What clues have Native Americans, Egyptian Kings, American Patriots, or African American freedom fighters left behind to help us figure out the most reliable story of what happened? Our 5th graders put on their detective hats and are introduced to historian skills, map skills, and using context to figure out the truth. 6th graders travel around the world and explore the social structures, geographies, and artifacts of ancient civilizations in India, Greece, and China. 7th and 8th graders argue over, analyze, and evaluate the causes and effects of various events and wars that shaped American history. Students are learning that history is not made up of just dates to memorize. History is something to be interpreted and evaluated based on the changing evidence we discover today.

As a member of TEP's Social Studies team, you will teach all students on your grade level one 45-minute block of social studies every day.

Please RSVP here!

To Apply:

The first stage of the process is the application below. In order to be considered, you must submit an application that consists of all four components: 1 - Resume, 2 - Cover letter, 3 - Instructional Video, and 4 - Submission of Teaching and Learning. The requirements for each of the four components are specified in detail below.

1. RESUME: Please submit an up-to-date resume.

2. COVER LETTER: Please submit a well-written cover letter that highlights your specific interest in joining the TEP community.

3. INSTRUCTIONAL VIDEO: Please submit an unedited video clip (maximum 15 minutes) of you teaching in a classroom setting (preferred) or a small-group setting. It is preferred that the students be in the same grade-level as the TEP teaching position for which you are applying, though this is not a strict requirement. The video may contain only one continuous, unedited clip (i.e. do not splice together multiple clips from different points in the lesson). The clip does not need to show an entire lesson; a brief lesson segment is perfectly acceptable.

If you do not have a video with students in the classroom you may still submit a video of yourself teaching. Get creative! You may include a video of you teaching (a) a lesson with/for no students, (b) a lesson of you teaching family members, (c) or a lesson for students virtually. We're excited to see your creativity.

The video must be accompanied by a written narrative that analyzes and reflects upon the teaching and learning that occurs in the lesson and may offer an explanation as to what occurred prior to and subsequent to the clip. There is no minimum or maximum length for the narrative. The video may be submitted in any format, but a link to a video posted online is preferred.

4. SUBMISSION OF TEACHING AND LEARNING: Submit one of the following three options:

Option A: Portfolio of Student Work that demonstrates the progress of at least two specific students that you have taught. The portfolio must contain a minimum of two work products for each student (for a minimum of four work products) completed at different points in time during the period when each student was in your class. The portfolio must be accompanied by a written narrative that analyzes and reflects upon the progress that each student demonstrates. There is no minimum or maximum length for the narrative.

Option B: Assessment Data for at least one entire class of students that you have taught. The assessments may be standardized national, state, or city assessments or your own self-created assessments. The assessment data can be provided in any form that you choose (official documents with students' last names crossed-out, or documents that you create to summarize student assessment performance). The data you provide should ideally show progress over time; as such, it is recommended (though not required) that you provide data for at least two assessments taken at different points in time. The assessment data must be accompanied by a copy of the assessments themselves. If a specific assessment is unavailable, provide a copy of a similar assessment. The assessment data must also be accompanied by a written narrative that provides background on the assessments, explains how the assessments measure student performance, and analyzes the results of your class. There is no minimum or maximum length for the narrative.

Option C: Original Curricular Tool of any form that you have personally developed. The requirement here is deliberately open-ended because we are interested in seeing anything that you have developed that you believe has meaningfully supported your students' learning. This may take the form of written materials, a unique instructional methodology, a technological innovation, etc. The curricular tool must also be accompanied by a written narrative that provides background on the tool, how the tool functions, and speaks to the impact of the tool within your classroom. There is no minimum or maximum length for the narrative.

The postdoctoral fellow will design and lead research that quantifies uncertainty and variation in parameters of Sala et al.’s model and examine their impacts on estimates of trawling-induced CO2 emissions. The postdoc will relate these results to scientists and policymakers through published manuscripts in peer-reviewed journals, whitepapers/policy papers, and presentations to mixed audiences.
The successful applicant will work closely on uncertainty analyses with the Null Lab (http://sarahnull.org) at Utah State University, The Devries lab at the University of California, Santa Barbara (https://tdevries.eri.ucsb.edu/), and Dr. Anastasia Romanou at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (https://www.giss.nasa.gov/staff/aromanou/).
