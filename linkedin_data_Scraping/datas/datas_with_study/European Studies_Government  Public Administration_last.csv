On the design side, we are adopting techniques to put the user at the centre of operations through design thinking and to bring business and development teams closer together through domain-driven design. We aim at shortening our delivery cycles by means of continuous testing through behaviour-driven design in continuous integration and delivery pipelines. The digital transformation will deliver fully digital end-to-end processes and new semantic search technologies, and will be further supported by the introduction of artificial intelligence into our solutions. Our main challenge remains to transform existing processes implemented in legacy systems into new ways of working running on these new architectures whilst enabling the business team to maintain their production targets. As we build this software we will also be working more closely than ever before with IP authorities across the world to co‑create, roll out and support new software solutions.

Samen zorgen zij voor ruim 100.000 banen én leveren een belangrijke bijdrage aan het oplossen van maatschappelijke vraagstukken als klimaat en digitalisering. Indrukwekkende cijfers! Wil jij hier ook een bijdrage aan gaan leveren? Kom ons dan hierbij helpen als beleidsmedewerker!Dit ga je doenVoordat we gaan vertellen wat je gaat doen, willen we je alvast wat achtergrond informatie geven.AerospaceAerospace (lucht- en ruimtevaart) beschikt binnen Zuid-Holland over een wereldwijd uitzonderlijke bundeling van kennis en kunde op het gebied van ontwerp en bouw van vliegtuigen, drones (UAV’s) satellieten, (meet)instrumenten en het inrichten van vliegvelden. Een belangrijk onderdeel van de Aerospace sector is het ruimtevaartcluster. Vanwege de goede uitgangspositie en de grote toegevoegde waarde die Aerospace ook binnen de topsector High Tech Systemen en Materialen (HTSM) genereert, kan inzet op Aerospace worden gezien als kans om de regionale economie en de concurrentiepositie van de provincie te versterken. Daarnaast beschikt de sector over een groot innovatief vermogen. Omdat de provincie een rol kan spelen in het versterken van het regionale innovatie-ecosysteem waarin deze potenties kunnen worden benut, vormt dit een belangrijke motivatie voor haar inzet binnen deze sector. Ook is het van belang dat er vanuit deze sector wordt bijgedragen aan de duurzame, digitale en circulaire transitie. Daarom wordt er onder andere ingezet op de ontwikkeling van NL Space Campus, de ontwikkeling van dronetechnologie en de verduurzaming van de luchtvaart.Smart industryDe maakindustrie is een belangrijke pijler van de economie in Zuid-Holland. Zuid-Holland kent een sterke maakindustrie (10.000 bedrijven) met een hightech toeleverketen (100.000 banen). De digitalisering van de industrie, oftewel Smart Industry, wordt gedreven door ontwikkeling van nieuwe ICT en productietechnologie en verandert de industrie radicaal. Om (internationaal) concurrerend te blijven is het cruciaal om de digitalisering in de (maak)industrie in Zuid-Holland te versnellen. Ook Europa ziet de waarde hiervan in, daarom financiert Europa verschillende European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIH), waarvan één in Zuid-Holland onder de noemer Digitalzh. De provincie draagt ook met cofinanciering bij aan EDIH in Zuid-Holland. Dit zijn samenwerkingen op regionaal, nationaal en Europees verband waarin mkb’ers geholpen worden met digitalisering.
