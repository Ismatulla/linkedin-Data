Seriously, I have worked with some of the supposed ""fives"" and they are not any different than my threes and fours.\r\n2. Quality is extremely low.

The emphasis is on getting through work as fast as possible and expectations for quality are not realistic.\r\n3. EY has a very hard time firing bad employees. If you get stuck with one it can be a nightmare.\r\n4.  EY has a heavy emphasis on wasting time. For example, there are lots and lots of checklists which have no value that you have to  fill out. Also, they wasted money and time on creating ""Canvas"" which is literally slower and more awkward than the previous workspace tool, GAMX. There is a heavy emphasis on ""reinventing the wheel"" and fixing problems  that aren\'t broken with even worse solutions. Instead of wasting money on useless tools, that money could have been spent on your employees in the  form of compensation.

Employees on global 360 accounts get better treatment.\r\n7. Some employees (executives mostly) tend to overemphasize how important this work is. Let\'s face it, if it was really glorious work then we would have action figures. \r\n8. Looks are very important.

If you want to be a partner, you have to be married (few exceptions).\r\n13. You will work on vacations.\r\n14. Loss of relationships with family and friends.\r\n15. Some backstabbing and credit-stealing (but not very common).\r\n16. Comp is below market but that\'s to be expected.\r\n17. Employee retention is not something management is interested in.
