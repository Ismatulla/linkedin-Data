Operating in 14 countries across Europe, the Secret Escapes Group continues to grow and establish itself as a world-class business, dedicated to giving our members the best range and value in luxury travel deals at low prices.

Founded in 2011, and following a number of acquisitions, we've doubled in size over the last 3 years and have a social-media following the size of a small country. We're a diverse and inclusive bunch of individuals from different backgrounds and with varied interests, but the one thing we all have in common is that we're good people (even if we do say so ourselves!)

Travel is – and should be – exciting, and booking a holiday or hotel should be a great experience. That's what we set out to achieve, and it's the philosophy that drives us on. We want to inspire the world to escape, and we do so with stylish writing, strong imagery, sought-after destinations, luxury hotels and great prices.

About Editorial

We're part of a global editorial team of 22 based across London, Berlin and Amsterdam. We have a great passion for producing excellent content for our customers and have regular opportunities for collaboration with the other departments. We're looking for grafters and self-starters to join the gang, people who can keep up with the fast pace and who want to make a difference. We're friendly, happy, and most importantly, we work really hard. We're not afraid to get our hands dirty and we're all incredibly passionate about our brand.

We're a small Dutch editorial team, based both in London and Amsterdam. We're always juggling several tasks at once and we work hard to meet tight deadlines. We do all of this with a smile on our face, a cookie in our hand and a genuine love for the job (and each other!).

About you

Are you a talented translator with a passion for travel, an eye for detail, an issue with poor grammar and a great sense of humour (without breaking the unwritten codes of taste and decency)? Tick those boxes and we're interested.

Things you'll be working on

Translating and localising sales copy for the hotels and destinations that we sell from English to Dutch
Sub-editing existing copy and new copy written by our in-house team
Support the global roll out of machine translation tools
Working with the Editorial team to define translations best practices and processes
Working with our bespoke content management system
Responding to internal requests for copy changes and updates
Translating content for CRM, social media, marketing campaigns and media sales when needed
Translating UX copy and CS emails when necessary

 The deal breakers

Excellent communication and writing skills in Dutch are required for this role
Outstanding grammar, spelling and proofreading skills
Strong understanding of Dutch culture and audience
Quality, accuracy and faultless attention to detail are critical
Impressive verbal and written communication skills, with the ability to communicate clearly, effectively and appropriately with colleagues at all levels

Your characteristics

An ability to quickly understand and write in our house style
Conscientious and driven to achieve results
Calm under pressure and able to prioritise effectively
Impressive accuracy and speed
Innovative, creative and commercially-minded
Good knowledge of, and genuine interest in, hotels and destinations
An all-round hard worker who's happy to get stuck in and work on some less-than-exciting tasks. It's not all about five-star hotels here, and you need to tackle everything with enthusiasm and a positive attitude
Above all, we're a close team who get along well, so someone who's happy, friendly and a team player

Things you should know

There's no travel involved with the role. You need to be in it for the love of the job and not the globetrotting opportunities.

We are an equal opportunity employer:

Diversity and inclusion are important to us at Secret Escapes and we encourage a culture where everyone can be themselves at work. We value and actively seek out a richly diverse range of talent and our policies ensure that every job application and employee is treated fairly, with equal opportunity to succeed.
