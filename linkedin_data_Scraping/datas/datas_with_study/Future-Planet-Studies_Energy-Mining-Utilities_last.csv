Power Cable Consultant,"Local Unit & Position Description:
DNV is one of the (if not THE) world’s leading advisory and verification consultancy firms in power cables and is looking for an intelligent and ambitious young colleague for the team of Underground and Submarine Power Cables to strengthen our department at our Energy Systems office location in Arnhem, the Netherlands. This position also has the aim for the first years to participate in a special innovation project together with one of the top-level Dutch technical universities (Eindhoven) with a (quite unique) possibility to get a PhD degree at the same time.
Due to the rapid acceleration and transition to greener and more renewable energy resources worldwide, power cables have become more and more important and are one of the crucial enablers for the energy transition. This involves e.g. submarine cable connections from the coast to wind farms, large interconnectors between countries, but also the underground transmission and distribution class cables that need to be installed and get loaded to a much higher average level to enable large scale renewable integration and electricity use. DNV has seen and experienced an exponential growth to act and be a strategic partner and trusted voice to industry to tackle this very important energy transition, while also continuing to keep a watchful eye on the management of existing electrical plants and infrastructure.
This includes therefore also advisory and verification services DNV performs for power cables, which have become critical and key system components to connect both offshore and onshore for windfarms, solar plants, hydro plants, transmission operators and distribution operators. Our role includes the performance of concept design studies, basic system designs, specifications, tender evaluations, design reviews, failure analysis, condition and remaining life assessments, heath indexing, inspections and quality assurance during design, manufacturing, installation and commissioning and development of methods and tools for all these activities.
As a Consultant in Underground and Submarine Power Cables you will be part of the Power Cables Team, and together with other colleagues you will help our customers achieve sustainable, world-class cable systems. The projects you execute in general are for any electrical asset owner, project developer, manufacturer, insurer or other party dealing with high voltage AC or DC power cable systems. Our team in Arnhem holds a leading position for the industry and within DNV worldwide, by means of top-level expertise and experience. Therefore, work often has international nature, and is often in cooperation with other DNV offices (e.g. Germany, Korea, Canada, Dubai, Singapore, China, etc.).
The project in which you will participate in the first years is a project we do with some key-industry players, a network owner (DSO) and one of the top-level Dutch technical universities. It has the ambition to design optimization methods for new and existing distribution grids to maximize renewable energy source integrations while maintaining reliability. DNV’s part will be focussed on the reliability of the grid components (especially power cables), making and testing models and digital twins, designing the integration in the optimization system that will be integrated in the DSO’s operational center and design and execution of real-world field trails. This will be done in close cooperation with the project partners and other important industry stakeholders. You will soon get a leading role in the technical content development (together with the surrounding experts in DNV and the experts from the partners).
During these first years you will also be able to be partly involved in other projects, which is a perfect preparation of the following period, where you will also lead them. You will provide engineering and consultancy services to customers in the utility and manufacturing industry worldwide. You participate in the execution of projects in the field of power cables.
