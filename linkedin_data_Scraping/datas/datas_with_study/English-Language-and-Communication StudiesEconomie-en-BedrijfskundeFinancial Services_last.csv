Je houdt toezicht op dit complexe speelveld als expert toezicht operationele & IT-risico’s bij DNB.
Jij hebt impact
Bij DNB werk je met impact op financiële stabiliteit en duurzame welvaart. Met een vermogen van miljarden pensioengelden en de verantwoordelijkheid voor miljoenen verzekerden zijn verzekeraars en pensioenfondsen belangrijke spelers op de financiële markt. Tegelijkertijd staan beide sectoren voor grote uitdagingen, mede gedreven door de ontwikkelingen die gaan over de operationele implementatie van het pensioenakkoord, cybersecurity, impact en beheersing van grote uitbestedingspartijen zoals BigTechs. Ook kom je in aanraking met interne controle raamwerken van instellingen, soms ondersteund door Artificial Intelligence. Jij bent als expert operational & IT-risk betrokken bij de beoordeling van allerlei vraagstukken op dit gebied. Aan jou de opdracht om in dit complexe speelveld toezicht te houden!
Zo doe je dat als expert toezicht operationele & IT-risico’s bij DNB
Je onderzoekt hoe pensioenfondsen en verzekeraars hun operationele en IT-risico’s beheersen. Recent is onze toezichtsmethodologie geactualiseerd, waarbij we risicogebaseerd en data-gedreven onze inzet bepalen op die instellingen waar aandacht ook echt nodig is. Met beoordelingskaders onderzoek je huidige risico’s en identificeer je nieuwe risico’s. De onderzoeken variëren in intensiteit en duur. Je beoordeelt rapportages, je voert data-analyses uit en je interviewt bestuurders, directie, management en specialisten van onder toezicht staande instellingen. Soms in risico-identificerende gesprekken, soms in gerichte onderzoeken van een paar dagen tot meerdere weken.
Daarnaast werk je mee aan deze vorm van toezicht in Europees verband, door kennisdeling met andere toezichthouders. De komst van de ‘Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)’ versterkt deze samenwerking. We zetten je in op uiteenlopende, sector-overschrijdende themaonderzoeken en projecten. De onderzoeken variëren in intensiteit en duur. Afhankelijk van je ervaring houd je toezicht op één of meerdere instellingen tegelijkertijd.
Wat ga je nog meer doen?
Je adviseert als expert de account toezichthouders en de directie van DNB over de operationele en IT-risico’s en de gewenste follow-up die nodig is.
Je onderhoudt interne en externe contacten en zorgt voor uitwisseling op je vakgebied. Dit doe je door gesprekken met specialisten in de sector maar ook door middel van het spreken op seminars.
Je werkt mee aan het opstellen van eigen normenkaders waarbij afstemming wordt gezocht met verschillende interne en externe stakeholders waaronder ministeries en koepelorganisaties.
Door onderzoeken te doen bij nationale en internationale instellingen en gerichte opleidingen te volgen, blijf je op de hoogte van nieuwe (technologische) ontwikkelingen op ons vakgebied.
Je hebt een prominente rol in kennisdeling binnen het team en binnen het uitvoerend toezicht op jouw vakgebied. Afhankelijk van je ervaring begeleid je junior collega’s binnen het team.
Je ondersteunt in onze interne digitaliseringsambitie, waarbij we ons richten op het ontwikkelen en beheren van risicoscoremodellen, inzetten van nieuwe innovatieve technologieën (denk aan Natural Language Processing of process mining/data-analyses) of inzet in pilots op het gebied van digitalisering.
Hier doe je dat
Je werkt als expert operational & IT-risk bij het Expertisecentrum Operationele & IT-risico’s, verantwoordelijk voor het in kaart brengen van de operationele & IT-risico’s bij pensioeninstellingen en verzekeraars. We houden nieuwe ontwikkelingen op ons vakgebied nauwgezet bij en we vertalen deze naar diverse toezichtthema’s. Je collega’s zijn 15 hoogopgeleide professionals en we hebben een sterke groeiambitie binnen DNB. De sfeer is informeel en collegiaal. We investeren veel in opleiding van kennis en ontwikkelingen in de sector. Wij zorgen voor ‘training on the job’ en onze beoordelingskaders, case studies en eerdere beoordelingen geven je de kans het vak van toezichthouder eigen te maken. Een goede samenwerking met je team en andere afdelingen binnen en buiten de divisie is daarbij cruciaal.
Bij DNB werken we hybride. Ons kantoor in Amsterdam is onze thuisbasis, de plek waar we elkaar ontmoeten, waar we met elkaar kennis delen en (samen)werken. Tegelijkertijd is er ook voldoende ruimte om een werkplek en -tijd te kiezen waar we ons werk het beste kunnen doen en waar we zo veel mogelijk waarde kunnen toevoegen. En natuurlijk zorgen we dat je ook thuis uitstekend kunt werken met laptop, telefoon en een goede thuiswerkplekinrichting.
Dit breng je mee

Je bent nieuwsgierig, kritisch en onderzoekend. Je bent sterk en zuiver in je mening- en oordeelsvorming, ook onder hoge druk. Je beschikt over helikopterview, bent analytisch sterk en in staat om snel dwarsverbanden te leggen. Uit grote hoeveelheden informatie weet je snel tot de essentie van een probleem te komen.
Je bent ervaren in het uitvoeren van meerdere onderzoeken tegelijkertijd waarbij voor jou geldt: hard op de inhoud en zacht op de relatie. Je bent in staat de bestuurs- en directieleden van de instellingen te challengen en waar nodig met behulp van verschillende stijlen te overtuigen van jouw standpunt.
Waar zijn we verder nog naar op zoek?
Je hebt een academische master in een bedrijfskundige of informatietechnische richting. Een afgeronde opleiding RE/RA/RO (of equivalent daarvan) is hierbij een pre.
Je hebt aantoonbare affiniteit met operationele en/of IT-risico’s alsmede met digitalisering.
Je hebt minimaal acht jaar ervaring bijvoorbeeld in de financiële dienstverlening, consultancy of accountancy.

Unique and challenging position for a credit risk expert in on-site banking supervision at DNB.
Jij hebt impact
Make an impact!
Working at DNB, you will have direct impact on financial stability and sustainable prosperity. As a credit risk expert you help achieve these goals by participating in targeted on-site inspections at banks and providing expertise to colleagues.
You will supervise all aspects of the credit risk process, from origination to monitoring to provisioning, and for a wide range of assets; from mortgages and SME loans to complex corporate financing structures. Your expertise helps to ensure that banks are safe and sound and can continue to support households, businesses and projects through their lending. In other words, you will have a direct impact on society!
This is what you will be doing as a credit risk expert at DNB
You will conduct inspections on the set-up and practical effectiveness of credit risk management in specific portfolios of Dutch and international banks. You conduct these inspections on-site, at the banks’ premises, as well as in a more hybrid form.
Key issues that will require attention in the period ahead are the determination of provisioning in line with new international accounting standards (IFRS9), the increasing use of complex algorithms in credit models, and the impact of geopolitical challenges, inflationary pressures and climate risks on the quality of credit portfolios.
This is what your job involves:
Assessing the management of credit risks at banks during inspections based on interviews, quantitative risk analyses, policy reviews and individual credit files. You will share your observations with the relevant account supervisors and advise them on the appropriate supervisory strategy.
Conducting complex, in-depth quantitative analyses, contributing to benchmarking studies, developing analytical tooling and research methods, at DNB as well as in international working groups.
Advising DNB's account supervisors, SSM supervisors and DNB's Executive Board on credit risk-related matters and the necessary follow-up.
Sharing your knowledge and observations with your DNB and SSM colleagues, to improve the effectiveness of Dutch and European credit risk supervision.
Hier doe je dat
This is where you will be working
You will work in a team of 14 colleagues within the Credit Risk (CR) department. CR is part of the On-Site Supervision and Banking Expertise (OSBE) Division, which carries out inspections and supports other banking supervision divisions with its expertise. The OSBE Division employs around 100 committed professionals with various backgrounds and nationalities.
The inspections that you will be involved in are project-based. The project teams are of varying composition, comprising DNB colleagues and other supervisors within the European Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM).
DNB forms part of the SSM of the ECB and the national competent authorities of the 20 euro area countries. Working for the SSM means that you will have the opportunity to travel abroad for training, on-site inspections and other activities from time to time.
Dit breng je mee
What do we need from you?
At DNB you will work with other experts of a high professional standard. Against this background, we are looking for candidates with strong problem-solving and analytical skills and sharp judgment. Your analyses demonstrate a keen awareness of both current and emerging risks.
You have proven affinity with data and complex quantitative analyses. You enjoy a ‘hands-on’ approach towards challenging a bank’s reporting, models and risk assumptions.
You always remain critical, continue to ask questions and are able to hold your ground in difficult discussions.
You are able to articulate your observations and opinions in a clear, well-argumented and transparent manner.
You are excited to contribute to financial stability and sustainable prosperity.
Last but not least, you are a team player and you are willing to contribute to a positive working atmosphere in the department.

What other characteristics are we looking for?
You have a university Master's degree in econometrics, finance, risk management, business administration, accountancy or another field with a strong analytical and quantitative component.
You have at least 3-5 years of experience in credit risk management at a bank, supervisory authority or credit risk consultancy firm.
You have experience with the development or assessment of models, stress testing, statistical analysis, scenario planning and/or dashboard development. You are proficient with programming languages such as R and Python.
Prior experience with model-based (IRB/IFRS9/Stress testing) aspects of credit risk at a bank, supervisory authority or credit risk consultancy firm is considered a strong asset.
You have knowledge of relevant prudential laws and regulations, such as CRR/CRD and relevant EBA Guidelines. This includes the translation of credit risk into capital requirements.
You have excellent written and verbal communication skills in English and (willingness to learn) Dutch. A good command of one or more other European languages is considered an asset.
You have no objection to travelling to other SSM member states from time to time.
