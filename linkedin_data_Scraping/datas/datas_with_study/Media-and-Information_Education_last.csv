The Faculty of Arts at Radboud University is looking for a postdoctoral researcher to collaborate on the project 'Poison, Medicine or Magic Potion? Shifting Perceptions of Drugs in and from Latin America (1820-2020)', which was recently awarded a grant by the Dutch Research Council. As a postdoctoral researcher, you will join the VICI research team (including two PhD candidates, two postdoctoral researchers and the PI) and also be a member of the Radboud Institute for Culture and History (RICH) and the department of Modern Languages and Cultures (MTC).
The Radboud Institute for Culture and History is looking for a postdoctoral researcher for the NWO-funded project Poison, Medicine or Magic Potion? Shifting Perceptions of 'Drugs' in and from Latin America (1820-2020). The conception of drugs has differed greatly over time, and the distinction between 'illegal drugs' and 'legal medicines' continues to be contested. An increasing number of scientists claim that it is necessary to demythologise drugs and to revise the perception that they constitute a threat to society. Latin America plays a key role in this debate, as psychoactive plants are part of its natural resources and Indigenous cultural history.

The main aim of this project is to analyse the changing perceptions of drugs in Latin America from the continent's independence to the present day (1820-2020). The project focuses on the representation of ayahuasca, peyote and coca/cocaine over time. It uses a partially unexplored corpus of discourses on these plants, including literature, ethnography and travel writing. The project will nuance the complex yet often reductive link between drugs and violence by studying the multifaceted perceptions of drugs from a cross-cultural, diachronic and interdisciplinary perspective. Two workshops and a symposium with stakeholders will examine how cultural perceptions of drugs influence policy making and vice versa.


As a postdoctoral researcher, you will analyse and compare shifting perceptions of ayahuasca, coca/cocaine and peyote in museums and memorials, and uncover how these intersect with national and legal constitutions of indigenous culture and religion. The comparative dimension will open a fruitful discussion with broader scholarship on the relation between Indigenous knowledge and heritage. You will use the different theoretical frameworks of the project (decolonial theory, posthumanism and affect studies) to study cultural heritage in the Amazonian Basin, the Andes region, the Sierra Madre Occidental, and the Netherlands. You will contribute to the development of the PhD candidates' methodological and theoretical skills and will work closely together with your fellow postdoctoral researcher on Drugs and Tourism in Latin America. In addition, you will work with scientific and societal partners in Latin America and in the Netherlands. You will organise several events for stakeholders in Nijmegen and make a podcast together with the other members of the team.


Your research will be embedded in RICH. Apart from the specific context of the VICI research project, you will participate in one of its research groups and contribute to the institute in general. Together with the present staff of the research institutes, you will set up research collaborations on these topics. You will publish about your research in highly qualified journals, conference proceedings, or edited volumes. Lastly, you will be expected to teach a limited number of Bachelor's and Master's courses.
Profile
You hold a PhD in a relevant field, such as Anthropology, Cultural Studies, Heritage Studies or a comparable discipline.
You have excellent oral and writing skills in Spanish (C2 or native) and hold a Cambridge Certificate (CPE2 level) in English or equivalent, or you are committed to obtaining this certificate within six months.
You are able to work independently and flexibly, taking initiative where needed, but are also able to communicate and collaborate effectively in a team setting.
You have administrative and organisational skills and you easily manage social media.
You are willing to live in the Netherlands during the contract period and to do field work in Latin America.
You have a track record of international high-profile publications.
Demonstrable experience in collaborating with museums in Latin America and with fieldwork is highly recommended.
Demonstrable experience in interdisciplinary research, including ethnobotany, environmental humanities, historiography or anthropology, is recommended.
Passive knowledge of Indigenous languages of Latin America relevant in this field and of Dutch is considered an advantage.

The Context

The Computer Science department of the University of Twente is expanding. Therefore, we are hiring 6 new faculty members, to strengthen our research in Artificial Intelligence, Cyberphysical systems and Software Engineering in the domains of (1) e-Health and (2) energy and sustainability. These new faculty members will be assigned in different research groups, but inter-group collaboration with other researchers working on these themes is considered essential to reach our overall ambitions. This position focuses on research in e-Health within a multidisciplinary setting.

The Position

The current way how healthcare is organized is no longer sustainable. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Remote Monitoring (RM) are key enabling technologies for a more sustainable and personalized care. E-health calls for system integration: sensor-based collection and interpretation of data about the condition and circumstances of patients, the integration of health data from different organizations in the care chain, and the Machine Learning based analysis of this data with AI for (real-time) clinical decision making (diagnostics and interventions).

Data Management and Biometrics (DMB) is a diverse research group that aims to develop efficient and trustworthy technology for data science and artificial intelligence by developing methods for autonomous, explainable, reliable, and robust gathering, preparation, and analysis of the data. On the theme of e-Health, DMB closely collaborates with other research groups associated with the University of Twente’s TechMed centre, such as the Biomedical Signals and Systems group (BSS), the Human Media Interaction group (HMI), and the Pervasive Systems group (PS). The research groups have strong collaborations with regional and (inter)national organizations such as hospitals, rehabilitation centres, elderly homes, insurance companies, companies developing medical devices and/or information systems, and many other kinds of organizations in the Health sector.

For this position, we are looking for a multi-disciplinary researcher and teacher on technology for holistic remote (multi) sensor-based monitoring and/or artificial intelligence for decision making, for whom collaboration is a second nature. Your teaching is intended to be primarily directed towards the bachelor Creative Technology and the master Interaction Technology.

You have a PhD degree in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, or related discipline;
You have demonstrated the ability to perform high-quality research in a field relevant to the theme of AI in e-Health such as but not limited to remote monitoring of patients, sensor-based machine learning for human behaviour or physiology modeling, explainable AI, machine learning for medical or behavioural decision making (diagnostics and interventions);
You have shown a willingness to acquire external funding and are prepared to expand your skills in this aspect;
You have good communication skills and are a team player;
You are fluent in English (knowledge of, or willingness to learn Dutch is an advantage);
You have a University Teaching Qualification (Dutch: BKO) or equivalent or you are willing to acquire one within three years.
Our offer
We offer a permanent position with a one-year probationary period (formally a 1-year contract with prospect of permanent contract) in the Data Management and Biometrics research group.
The position comes with a start-up package that allows you to appoint one PhD student.
Our terms of employment are in accordance with the Dutch Collective Labor Agreement for Universities (CAO) and include a holiday allowance of 8% of the gross annual salary and a year-end bonus of 8.3%.
Depending on your relevant background and experience, the gross monthly salary on a full-time basis ranges from € 3974,- (scale 11) to € 7.362,- (scale 14) gross per month.
A minimum of 29 leave days in case of full-time employment based on a formal workweek of 38 hours. A fulltime employment in practice means 40 hours a week, therefore resulting in 96 extra leave hours on an annual basis.
A solid pension scheme.
Free access to sport facilities on campus.
We are a family-friendly institution, which offers parental leave for both parents (both paid and unpaid) and career support for partners.
We appreciate diversity of profiles, cultures, and backgrounds, and promote an inclusive working culture.
Furthermore, we offer excellent professional and personal development programs.
Finally, you work in a lively, inspiring, and dynamic working environment in an organization focusing on internationalization, where you have a high degree of responsibility and independence.

PhD on Auditing Framework and tool for robust and reliable AI software development and operations,"PhD on Auditing Framework and tool for robust and reliable AI software development and operations (DevOps) (0,8 – 1,0 FTE)

Jheronimus Academy of Data Science (JADS) Den Bosch, is proud to start with three large Robust AI labs together with:

Deloitte (Auditing for Responsible AI Software Systems) – 5 PhD’s
DPG Media (Responsible Media Lab) – 5 PhD’s together with University of Amsterdam (UvA)
ILUSTRE (Innovation Lab for Utilities on Sustainable Technology and Renewable Energy) – 5 PhD’s

JADS is seeking enthusiastic colleagues for the position of PhD students. We operationalize the huge ambition around AI by explicitly aligning our research agenda on Robust AI with the United Nation’s sustainable development goals.
The project is funded in a public-private partnership by NWO/NLAIC and the private partners. This position is part of the Deloitte project.

Short Description
The next generation of enterprise applications is quickly becoming AI-enabled, providing novel functionalities with unprecedented levels of automation and intelligence. As we recover, reopen, and rebuild, it is time to rethink the importance of trust. At no time has it been more tested or valued in leaders and each other. Trust is the basis for connection. Trust is all-encompassing: physical, emotional, digital, financial, and ethical. A nice-to-have is now a must-have; a principle is now a catalyst; a value is now invaluable.

Are you an enthusiastic and ambitious researcher with a completed master's degree in a field related to machine learning (Computer science, AI, Data Science) or in Electrical Engineering with an affinity for AI and deep learning? Does the idea of working on real-world problems and with industry partners excite you? Are you passionate about using trustworthy AI methods for the next generation of auditing processes, which are increasingly AI-enabled and data-driven? And are you interested in delivering new tools to ascertain the robustness and reliability of the next generation of AI software?

We are recruiting a Ph.D. candidate who will develop and validate novel concepts, methods, and tools for monitoring, auditing, and fostering the robustness and reliability of AI software systems and trial them with industrial partners who work with Deloitte.

Job Description
This vacancy falls under the auspices of the JADE lab, which is the data/AI engineering and governance research UNIT of the JADS, and DELOITTE. In particular, this position is associated with JADE’s ROBUST program on Auditing for Responsible AI Software System (SAFE-GUARD), which is financed under the NWO LTP funding scheme with Deloitte as the key industry partner.

Whilst the overall objective of SAFE-GUARD is auditing of AI software, it may be further refined in the following more elaborated goal: ""Explore, develop and validate novel auditing theories, tools, and methodologies that will be able to monitor and audit whether AI applications adhere in terms of fairness (no bias), explainability, and transparency (easy to explain), robustness and reliability (delivering same results under various execution environments), respect of privacy (respecting GDPR), and safety and security (with no vulnerabilities).""
The industrial setting of the deep involvement of Deloitte will balance the rigor with relevance and ascertain fit with societal requirements and trends, validation with industrial case studies.

Scientific Challenge
Like DevOps, MLOps adopts the continuous integration and continuous testing cycle to produce and deploy production-ready new micro-releases and versions of AI software. This implies a culture shift between data analysts, data engineers, deployment and system engineers, and domain experts, with improved dependency management (and thus transparency) between model development, training, validation, and deployment. In addition, MLOps requires sophisticated policies based on metrics and telemetry such as performance indicators like F1, accuracy scores, and software quality.

At the same time, AI models are trained to assume that data used is representative of future data, i.e., input data is independently and identically distributed. This implies that random and noisy input data corruptions can lead to a lack of robustness. From here, the need to provide an instrument able to maintain the robustness of AI models when new data comes and to realize a new version with the same reliability value.

Job Requirements
Candidates should:
Have a MSc. in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, Computer Engineering, AI or a related discipline;
Have a strong interest in data engineering and governance, machine-learning and deep-learning;
Have excellent programming skills and be highly motivated, be rigorous and disciplined when developing algorithms and software according to high quality standards;
Have good technical understanding of the statistical models used in data science and machine learning;
Have knowledge of, or a willingness to familiarize themselves with, current research into machine learning for software engineering trustworthiness evaluation;
Have a commitment to develop algorithms that analyze Big Data from software-defined infrastructures as well as AI application code;
Be a fast learner, autonomous and creative, show dedication and be hard working;
Possess good communication capabilities and be an efficient team worker;
Be fluent in English, both spoken and written.

Conditions of Employment
Being appointed at JADS provides a meaningful job in a dynamic and ambitious community of 2 universities and startups. Based on the project, the candidate receives an appointment at TU/Eindhoven or Tilburg University.

As a PhD Student at JADS you will have a full-time employment for a total of four years, with an intermediate evaluation after nine months. JADS offers excellent employment conditions with attention to flexibility and (personal) development and attractive fringe benefits. The gross monthly salary is in accordance with the Collective Labor Agreement for Dutch Universities. The minimum gross salary is € 2.541 per month up to a maximum of € 3.247 in the fourth year;

These new faculty members will be assigned in different research groups, but inter-group collaboration with other researchers working on these themes is considered essential to reach our overall ambitions. One of the six positions is in the Human Media Interaction (HMI) group and focusses on research in e-Health.


The Position

Research into multimodal conversational systems such as chatbots, virtual humans, or social robots to coach people to live a healthier lifestyle, both from a physical and mental perspective, has seen a steady growth in the past couple of years. With the introduction of conversational systems such as ChatGPT and Bard, it looks as if smooth natural language conversations with an AI system have become possible. However, lifestyle coaching systems need a more sensitive and controlled mechanism to decide on what personalized advice to give. They need to be sensitive to the possibly vulnerable physical and mental state of the user and be aware of the possible effects of their advice. Furthermore, the information they provide should be communicated in a convincing way, but also be reliable and trustworthy. We are looking for a candidate with an AI background that can contribute to intelligent systems that can realise these goals.

Human Media Interaction (HMI) is a diverse and interdisciplinary research group that studies and designs interactive systems that users can intuitively interact with, ranging from Brain Computer Interfaces to Conversational Systems and Ambient Intelligence applications. In the area of Conversational Systems, HMI has expertise on speech technology, dialogue systems, embodied conversational agents and social robots. On the theme of e-Health, HMI has a strong tradition in contributing to a variety of coaching systems such as applications to increase physical fitness, advice on particular conditions (asthma, diabetes), or helping people to stop smoking or drinking. Research is conducted in coalitions with other research groups from inside and outside the University of Twente and with external stakeholders such as hospitals, rehabilitation centers, elderly homes, etcetera.

PhD position in meta-research: The effectiveness of interventions to improve psychological science,"Tilburg University | Tilburg School of Social and Behavioral Sciences is looking for a PhD position in meta-research: The effectiveness of interventions to improve psychological science

Department : Methodology and Statistics
Location : Tilburg
Full-time equivalent : 1.0 FTE (40 hours per week)
Monthly full-time gross salary : €2.541 (first year) - €3.247 (fourth year)
Duration of employment contract : 12 and 36 months

We are looking for an ambitious PhD candidate who is driven by the motivation to improve science, and is not afraid of a challenge!

Your position
In this PhD project, you will empirically assess the effectiveness of proposed/implemented interventions in the publication system to improve robustness of psychological science. You will study whether the intended effect(s) is/are achieved, but also whether there are any positive or negative side-effects (e.g., can researchers “game” the system? How does the intervention affect diversity and inclusion?).
A rough outline of the project would entail:
Project 1: Conduct a systematic review of the current proposed/implemented interventions to improve reproducibility and replicability of psychological research findings.
Project 2: Conduct retrospective observational studies comparing papers that were or weren’t subject to certain interventions. This can include comparisons of different research fields where different best practices are the norm.
Project 3: Implement a randomized controlled trial to directly test the effect of certain interventions at the study or journal level on reproducibility and replicability.

You are encouraged to make this research your own, by choosing your own specific focus and project implementations.

Research context
You will work under direct supervision of dr. Michèle Nuijten and prof. dr. Jelte Wicherts. You will be part of the Meta-Research Center (https://metaresearch.nl), a renowned research group working on a variety of topics within meta-research in psychology (i.e. publication bias, meta-analysis, causal inference, p-hacking, preregistration, qualitative research). You will have ample opportunity to collaborate within the research group, and you are encouraged to seek collaborations outside the Meta-Research Center as well.
Your findings on the effectiveness of interventions to improve psychological science can have direct impact on the field. You are encouraged to actively share your findings and recommendations through scientific papers and conferences, but also through channels such as blog posts, social media, and news outlets. We welcome active discussion and invite criticism on our work.
We strongly value open science: among other things, we encourage preregistration, sharing of data and materials, and we facilitate open access publication.
Beside research, you will also contribute to the teaching tasks within the department.

Background
The past 10 years have been a time of reflection for psychology. Many key findings could not be replicated, which led to the question: how trustworthy is psychological research? Research from the last decade has pointed to a combination of publication pressure and publication bias, questionable research practices, and lack of transparency (among other things) as the cause for this “replication crisis”.
We are now at the point where we can shift our focus to solutions: can we implement interventions that make research findings in psychology more reproducible and replicable? Many interventions have been suggested already in various contexts: training (of students and researchers), recognition and rewards, funding, and more. In this project we will focus on interventions in the publication system (e.g., preregistration, open science badges, TOP guidelines, statistical checks). It is encouraging to see the growing list of initiatives, but we need more empirical research to assess which interventions actually work.

Your qualifications
We have the following requirements:
A (nearly finished) (Research) Master’s degree in psychology or a related field
A strong background in methodology and statistics

The ICLON, Leiden University Graduate School of Teaching is looking for a
PhD candidate Children's digital media use and their social development(0.8FTE for 5 years)
Vacancy number: 13565
Today’s children and youth (C&Y) are immersed in digital media in the full media landscape that surrounds them across contexts. The Covid pandemic revealed inequal opportunities for C&Y to use digital media. There are differences in digital media access, motivation/skills to use digital media, and support of key persons (e.g., parents/teachers/peers) herein. Understanding mechanisms in C&Y’s digital media use related to their development helps them and key persons to act in evidence-informed ways to reduce inequality. A better understanding of these factors is especially important during transition periods (i.e., from kindergarten to primary school or the early years in secondary school). During these periods, deviations in development could strongly impact C&Y’s opportunities. Our aim is that scientists, parents, professionals and C&Y understand the mechanisms that influence the relations between C&Y's digital media use, their development and opportunities. Furthermore, we want to develop skills and tools to support a positive impact of C&Y’s digital media use on development and equality of opportunities.

The Faculty of Law, Institute for Information Law (IViR), and the University Research Priority Area on Trust in the Digital Society (TRUST RPA: https://www.ivir.nl/trust-in-the-digital-society-new-uva-research-priority-area/ ) is looking for a postdoctoral researcher to study the institutional safeguards of trustworthy centralized and decentralized techno-social infrastructures.

The TRUST RPA is a five year long interdisciplinary research initiative to study how we trust is changing due to the emergence of new trust production technologies, and the disruption of existing trust relations.

The digital society relies on an ever-expanding network of digital infrastructures. This forces us to rethink some of our basic assumptions about one of the most fundamental resources in all interpersonal, social, economic relations: trust.
Despite their widespread use, we know little about the trustworthiness of our digital infrastructures. At best it is difficult to establish their trustworthiness (such as with AI), at worst they are proven to be untrustworthy (as is the case with social media).
Some of these digital infrastructures play key roles in interpersonal and societal trust dynamics. They disrupt existing trust relations and offer new ways to trust each other.
Our scientific methods and theories face serious limits when it comes to the study of change of social structures, institutions, and processes under the conditions of rapid technological transformation. Research on trust in technology and trust by technology is siloed, and focuses on narrowly defined technologies (AI), or problems (system security), and lacks a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, long-term-view.

This postdoctoral position (embedded in the TRUST RPA, supervised by both the Institute for Information Law, at the Amsterdam Law School, and at least one other participating faculty) will use empirical research to study how various new technological infrastructures disrupt or can enhance existing societal (impersonal, institutional) trust relations and strive to establish new forms of trust relations in society.

What are you going to do?

 The successful candidate will:
Conduct empirical, qualitative research (interviews, case studies, discourse analysis) on the dynamics of institutional, impersonal trust with regards to emerging digital technologies, such as digital platforms, web3 technologies, or Machine Learning based automated systems.
Coordinate the development, fieldwork and initial analysis of a large-scale longitudinal survey
Conduct work on the emerging European technology regulation framework (Digital Services Act, AI Act, Digital Markets Act) using doctrinal research, normative research and discourse analysis
Organize events, conferences
Participate in grant proposal development, international network building
Acquiree funding

The Postdoctoral researcher will be hired by the Faculty of Law, closely collaborating with two other postdoctoral researchers in the Trust RPA. The team will be supervised by the PIs of the TRUS RPA: Balazs Bodo, Associate Professor at the Institute of Information Law (IViR) at the Faculty of Law, Jan B. Engelmann, Professor of Neuroeconomics at the Amsterdam School of Economics, Theo Araujo, Associate Professor Communication in the Digital Society at the Amsterdam School of Communication Research (ASCoR), Tom van Engers, Professor in Legal Knowledge Management at the University of Amsterdam, and Marc Tuters, Assistant Professor in the New Media and Digital Culture Division of Media Studies at the Faculty of Humanities.

What do we require of you?

 The successful candidate has:
a PhD degree in law, or social sciences (sociology, economics, political science, communication science, science and technology studies or related fields)
strong empirical research skills;
familiarity with qualitative research methods,
familiarity with doctrinal research or policy research;
good knowledge of current developments in information markets and technology;
academic excellence, as shown in the grade transcripts and curriculum vitae.
a creative mind and analytical intelligence;
an interest in working in a multidisciplinary team;
willingness to learn new knowledge, and acquire new skills required by the project;
excellent written and spoken command of English, and ideally knowledge of Dutch
interest in working on interdisciplinary topics, in interdisciplinary teams.

Candidates, who have:
quantitative skills, including survey development, statistical analysis, and/or
familiarity with R, python or any other programming language, and/or
big data collection and analysis skills, and/or
previous experience in the private or public sector

will be given extra consideration in the application process.

We strongly encourage members of broadly understood minority socio-cultural groups to apply. We believe that there are several traditionally underrepresented, but incredibly forceful perspectives, that have transformed our respective disciplines. Recent scholarship by persons of colour, feminist, intersectionalist scholars, scholars from the Global South have highlighted fundamental issues with the design, operation, and impact of techno-social systems that remained in the blind spots of mainstream scholarship. Without such contributions, serious problems, such as racial bias in AI systems, would have gone unnoticed and left unaddressed by more careful technical design and better regulation.

Our offer

We offer a temporary employment contract for 38 hours per week for a period of 36 months with a probationary period of two months. The preferred starting date is as soon possible.
The gross monthly salary, based on 30,4 -38 (0.8-1 FTE) hours per week and dependent on relevant experience, ranges between € 2,960 to € 4,670 (scale 10). UvA additionally offers an extensive package of secondary benefits, including 8% holiday allowance and a year-end bonus of 8.3%. The UFO profile Researcher 4 is applicable. A favourable tax agreement, the ‘30% ruling’, may apply to non-Dutch applicants. The Collective Labour Agreement of Universities of the Netherlands is applicable.

Are you interested in studying networks and using methodology at the cross-section of business analytics, econometrics and computer science? The Business Analytics section at the University of Amsterdam Business School invites applications for a PhD position in Network Statistics and Machine Learning. We are looking for candidates with the ambition to work and succeed at the highest international academic level.

The main topic of research is network analysis and modelling using statistical and machine learning tools. Network data are ubiquitous in finance, social media, the economy, and business. Social networks play an increasingly important role in society. For example, the Reddit community WallStreetBets hyped the stock of GameStop (GME), causing a short squeeze and extremely volatile stock prices in early 2021. Similarly, statements made on social networks such as Twitter have been shown to impact public and voter opinions. Exemplifying how social networks directly affect the economy, this project focusses on studying network data with a specific interest in modelling and understanding how networks change over time. Change detection in an online fashion is a challenging task in networks of large size, a common property of social networks.

In this research, the candidate will first investigate and develop interpretable network analysis approaches using statistical models and test them on real-life data. Then geometric deep learning approaches for the tasks like node classification, link prediction and graph classification will be developed with change detection ability. In the final phase of the project, the candidate should bring together two families of methods and design an optimized algorithm that is both interpretable and yields a high performance in network change detection.

The PhD student will work in close collaboration with the supervisory team and other faculty on the tasks.
The supervisory team will consist of dr. Inez Zwetsloot (ABS), dr. Simon Trimborn (ASE) and dr. Stevan Rudinac (ABS).

What are you going to do?

Develop novel interpretable statistical models for network analysis;
develop novel deep-learning approaches for node classification, link prediction, and community detection in network data;
create open data and software tools for the envisioned network analysis tasks;
present research findings at international conferences;
write up findings for publication in international journals;
pursue and complete a PhD thesis within the appointed duration of four years;
attend classes and seminars (including those offered at other universities) to develop thinking and research skills further;
participate in and contribute to departmental research functions (PhD Day, research seminars, and research meetings);
assist in knowledge dissemination activities;
participate in teaching-related activities (to a limited degree), including undergraduate tutorials and the supervision of MSc and/or BSc thesis projects.

What do we require?

Formal requirements:
Masters’ degree in Statistics, Econometrics, Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Mathematics, or a related field (expected to finish by September 2023)

Excellent communication skills in English, both oral and written, ideally with experience writing for a scientific audience;
willingness and motivation to independently formulate research projects and carry them through to completion;
mathematical skills, data analytics skills, and a strong willingness to develop these skills further;
excellent programming skills in one or more of the following languages: Python, R, C, C++;
preferably experience with at least one of the following: network data analysis, deep learning libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow, timeseries modeling and prediction, high-performance computing.3

Additional requirements:
Preference is given to candidates with some research experience (e.g., Master thesis and/or research assistant experience);
strong commitment to methodological rigor and scientific integrity;
energy and passion for statistics and machine learning;
intellectual curiosity, eagerness to learn, and openness to criticism;
willingness to participate in disseminating research results and valorization.

Our offer

The employment contract will be for four years with an initial period of 18 months, with an intermediate evaluation after 18 months and a possibility to extend it for 30 months (in total, four years). End-result should be a PhD thesis. An educational plan will be drafted that includes attendance of courses and (international) conferences. Preferred starting date is 1 September 2023.

PhD on Fairness of AI Software Systems,"PhD on Fairness of AI Software Systems (0,8 – 1,0 fte)

Jheronimus Academy of Data Science (JADS) Den Bosch, is proud to start with three large Robust AI labs together with:

Deloitte (Auditing for Responsible AI Software Systems) – 5 PhD’s
DPG Media (Responsible Media Lab) – 5 PhD’s together with University of Amsterdam (UvA)
ILUSTRE (Innovation Lab for Utilities on Sustainable Technology and Renewable Energy) – 5 PhD’s

JADS is seeking enthusiastic colleagues for the position of PhD students. We operationalize the huge ambition around AI by explicitly aligning our research agenda on Robust AI with the United Nation’s sustainable development goals.
The project is funded in a public-private partnership by NWO/NLAIC and the private partners. This position is part of the Deloitte project.

Short Description
The next generation of enterprise applications is quickly becoming AI-enabled, providing novel functionalities with unprecedented levels of automation and intelligence. As we recover, reopen, and rebuild, it is time to rethink the importance of trust. At no time has it been more tested or valued in leaders and each other. Trust is the basis for connection. Trust is all-encompassing: physical, emotional, digital, financial, and ethical. A nice-to-have is now a must-have; a principle is now a catalyst; a value is now invaluable.
Are you an enthusiastic and ambitious researcher with a completed master's degree in a field related to machine learning (Computer science, AI, Data Science) or in Electrical Engineering with an affinity for AI and deep learning? Does the idea of working on real-world problems and with industry partners excite you? Are you passionate about using trustworthy AI methods for the next generation of auditing processes, which are increasingly AI-enabled and data-driven? And are you interested in delivering new tools to ascertain the fairness of the next generation of AI software?
We are recruiting a Ph.D. candidate who will develop and validate novel concepts, methods, and tools for monitoring, auditing, and fostering fairness of AI software systems and trial them with industrial partners who work with Deloitte.

Job Description
This vacancy falls under the auspices of the JADE lab, which is the data/AI engineering and governance research UNIT of the Jheronimus Academy of Data Science (JADS), and DELOITTE. In particular, this position is associated with JADE’s ROBUST program on Auditing for Responsible AI Software System (SAFE-GUARD), which is financed under the NWO LTP funding scheme with Deloitte as the key industry partner.
The overall objective of SAFE-GUARD is auditing of AI software, it may be further refined in the following more elaborated goal: ""Explore, develop and validate novel auditing theories, tools, and methodologies that will be able to monitor and audit whether AI applications adhere in terms of fairness (no bias), explainability, and transparency (easy to explain), robustness and reliability (delivering same results under various execution environments), respect of privacy (respecting GDPR), and safety and security (with no vulnerabilities).""
The industrial setting of the deep involvement of Deloitte will balance the rigour with relevance and ascertain fit with societal requirements and trends, validation with industrial case studies.

Scientific Challenge
Application software developers cannot train-, test- and deploy AI models independent of socio-political, ethical, cultural, and personal context. At the same time, data is not objective: it is inherently reflective of pre-existing social and cultural biases, thus implying that AI (and AI-induced applications) may lead to (unintended) negative consequences and inequitable outcomes in practical settings. This project will develop novel methodologies, including techniques and tools, that can be exploited during audit activity when detecting AI software bias, possibly predicting those conditions and recommending ways to triage them. These aspects render important aspects when developing trustworthy AI software.

Job Requirements
Candidates should:
Have a MSc. in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, Computer Engineering, AI or a related discipline;
Have a strong interest in data engineering and governance, machine-learning and deep-learning;
Have excellent programming skills and be highly motivated, be rigorous and disciplined when developing algorithms and software according to high quality standards;
Have good technical understanding of the statistical models used in data science and machine learning;
Have knowledge of, or a willingness to familiarize themselves with, current research into machine learning for software engineering trustworthiness evaluation;
Have a commitment to develop algorithms that analyze Big Data from software-defined infrastructures as well as AI application code;
Be a fast learner, autonomous and creative, show dedication and be hard working;
Possess good communication capabilities and be an efficient team worker;
Be fluent in English, both spoken and written.

Conditions of Employment
Being appointed at JADS provides a meaningful job in a dynamic and ambitious community of 2 universities and startups. Based on the project, the candidate receives an appointment at TU/Eindhoven or Tilburg University.

As a PhD Student at JADS you will have a full-time employment for a total of four years, with an intermediate evaluation after nine months. JADS offers excellent employment conditions with attention to flexibility and (personal) development and attractive fringe benefits. The gross monthly salary is in accordance with the Collective Labor Agreement for Dutch Universities. The minimum gross salary is € 2.541 per month up to a maximum of € 3.247 in the fourth year;

PhD Artificial intelligence for tracking the politics of climate change adaptation,"A highly motivated PhD student on the interface of artificial intelligence and climate action.

Keen to further develop artificial intelligence approaches to enhance climate action? Always wondered why governments are typically reluctant to track their implementation of climate action? Curious about the political dynamics that shape how governments around the globe are (not) adapting to climate change? Then this PhD project on using artificial intelligence methods for analyzing the politics of tracking climate change adaptation could be a great fit!


This PhD position is part of the NWO-VIDI project led by Dr. Robbert Biesbroek (Public Administration and Policy group) entitled “High ambitions, (s)low implementation? The politics of tracking adaptation to climate change (2023-2027).

Background of the program: Adapting to the impacts of climate change is necessary and increasingly urgent. Governments across the globe have increasingly formulated high adaptation ambitions to become more climate resilient. In order to understand if these ambitions are implemented in practice, tracking progress on adaptation is of critical importance. This program aims to develop, theorize and empirically test the causes and consequences of the politics of adaptation tracking. Adopting a comparative approach, the program investigates the political dynamics around the Global Stocktake under the UNFCCC Paris Agreement, the EU Climate Change Adaptation Strategy, and ongoing climate change adaptation developments in several countries from across the globe. In the program mixed methods are used, combining traditional methods of expert interviews, observations and focus group discussions, with machine learning and quantitative text analysis to analyze the politics of adaptation tracking.
The program takes a solutions-oriented perspective by co-designing politically sensitive intervention pathways with practitioners. It provides concrete evidence-based insights where and how to intervene in policy processes in order to accelerate the design and execution of adequate and effective frameworks on adaptation tracking.

There are two PhD positions in this NWO-VIDI program. The position in this call will focus on using Artificial Intelligence methods to track the politics of tracking climate change adaptation. The other PhD position will focus on conceptualizing and empirically investigating the politics of adaptation tracking using a primarily a qualitative approach.

For this PhD position “Artificial intelligence for tracking the politics of climate change adaptation”, you will:
Employ state-of-the art machine learning tools to develop evidence maps on what is already known about the politics of tracking policy for climate and other sustainability challenges
Develop and apply natural language processing methods to analyze the politics of tracking adaptation to climate change from a variety of sources (media, policy documents, minutes, speeches, etc.) at national and global levels
Co-organize and participate in workshops on the politics of adaptation tracking
Lead the development of 4 scientific publications which form the basis of your PhD dissertation. You will also be involved in developing program-level publications (as co-author)
Present your work at (inter)national scientific conferences and/or symposia
In addition to the other PhD candidate in this program, you will collaborate in Dr. Biesbroek’s research lab with ~10 other postdocs, PhD candidates, and research assistants working on climate change related topics. For this project you will also collaborate with Prof. Dr. Ioannis Athanasiadis (Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, Wageningen University) who will act as the second promotor in this PhD project.

Vacaturenummer: 11387
The Amsterdam School of Historical Studies (ASH) currently has a vacant Postdoc researcher position as part of the Dutch National Research Agenda (Nationale Wetenschapsagenda, NWA)-funded project Foreign Fighters in Ukraine: Mobilisations, Combat experiences, and Return trajectories, led by main researchers Dr Samuël Kruizinga (UvA) and Dr Elanie Rodermond (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam/NSCR). ASH is one of the five Research Schools within the Amsterdam Institute for Humanities Research.
What are you going to do?

Since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, thousands of volunteer ""foreign fighters"" – including an unknown number of Dutchmen – have joined Ukraine’s International Legion. The research project Foreign Fighters in Ukraine: Mobilisations, Combat experiences, and Return trajectories’ central aim is to study both foreign fighting generally and increase our understanding of the International Legion specifically. Specifically, it aims to ascertain how the unique Ukrainian battlespace and the (social) media landscape shape mobilisations, combat experiences, and return trajectories of this iteration of the foreign fighter phenomenon.
You will, on the basis of currently available, but disparate historical data sets on foreign fighters in the 19th and 20th century, as well as contemporary information on returning Islamic State volunteers, set up hypotheses related to this project’s central aim. Then you will test these by making creative use of contemporary open sources on foreign fighter involvement in the Russo-Ukrainian war, including social media posts. Crucially, you will contact and then interview actual, potential and/or returning Dutch members of the International Legion.
Your research will be indispensable in increasing policy makers’ as well as mental health and legal experts’ ability to understand the ramifications of foreign fighting on both systemic and personal levels. Societal stakeholders in the overall project are ARQ Nationaal Psychotrauma Centrum, the Dutch national centre for specialist diagnostics and treatment of people with complex psychotraumatic complaints, ARQ Kenniscentrum Oorlog, Vervolging en Geweld, the prime Dutch knowledge centre for research on the psychosocial impact of war on individuals and society, the T.M.C. Asser Institute, which specialises in international (humanitarian) law and operates at the interface of academia, legal practice and governance, and the Nederlands Veteraneninstituut, which promotes the social recognition of combat veterans, and has expertise in and developed a working methodology for sensitive, post-mission interviews with combat veterans. Together with these stakeholders and project leaders Kruizinga and Rodermond you will contribute to a workshop to be organized by all subproject partners to bring together historical, legal, psychological, psychiatric, political and social science, experiential and government perspectives on foreign fighting in Ukraine and beyond; to a joint policy brief resulting from the workshop designed to disseminate public knowledge and influence policy; and to a podcast on foreign fighting.

Your tasks and responsibilities:
participating in meetings with the project leads and partners;
conducting research, presenting intermediate research results at workshops and conferences and publishing a single-authored, peer reviewed article;
co-organising knowledge dissemination activities (workshop, policy brief, podcast).

What do you have to offer?

We are looking for a team player with a research interest in the lived experiences of volunteers, who enjoys the challenges of new research areas and formats, relishes working within an interdisciplinary team, and is interested in communicating results to both various scientific communities and to a wider public.

Your experience and profile:
a PhD in history, criminology, anthropology, law, or related fields;
a strong cooperative attitude and willingness to engage in collaborative research;
experience with semi-structured interviews in research settings;
near-native command of Dutch (required for the interviews) and English.
research interests related to foreign fighting, either in the past or the present;
excellent qualitative research skills demonstrated by a track record of publishing in high-ranking journals and/or with leading presses or a demonstrable capacity to develop such a record;
enthusiasm for communicating academic research to non-academic audiences.

What can we offer you?

The Postdoc researcher will be appointed at the Department of History, European Studies and Religious Studies of the Faculty of Humanities at the University of Amsterdam and will conduct the research in Amsterdam School of Historical Studies (ASH). The employment contract is for one year and 26.6 hours a week (= 0.7 fte). Preferred starting date is either 01 June 2023 or 1 September 2023 depending on the availability of the selected candidate.
The gross monthly salary, based on 38 hours per week and relevant experience, ranges between € 3.703 to € 5.439. This sum does not include the 8% holiday allowance and the 8,3% year-end allowance. A favourable tax agreement, the ‘30% ruling’, may apply to non-Dutch applicants. The Collective Labour Agreement of Dutch Universities is applicable.

What else do we offer?
excellent possibilities for further professional development and education;
an enthusiastic, inspiring and professional academic team;
the opportunity to collaborate with leading researchers at research institutes that - partly as a result of their interdisciplinary approach - are world renowned.
