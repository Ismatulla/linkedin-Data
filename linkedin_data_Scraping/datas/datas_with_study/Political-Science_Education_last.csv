We are looking for 2 PhD candidates to join a new research project lead by Dr. Bert N. Bakker (PI), supported by an NWO VIDI grant. The project is embedded in the Hot Politics Lab (an interdisciplinary research group focusing on political psychology) and the Amsterdam School of Communication Research at the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences.
This project starts with the observations that with a pandemic, the war in Ukriane, climate change, terrorist attacks, and financial meltdowns, we have in the last twenty years experienced multiple threats that potentially could have (or will in the future) fundamentally alter our way of life. Threats have adverse effects when they erode democratic stability by sparking violence and fuelling support for anti-democratic politics. However, threats might benefit society when they trigger desired behaviour, such as reducing the eco-footprint or getting a vaccination. Given the complex role of threat in society, it is crucial to understand better the processes underlying people's threat perceptions and develop strategies for mitigating the adverse effects and stimulating the beneficial effects of threat perceptions on democracy and society. This project bridges theories from communication science, psychology, and neuroscience by the overarching research question: How do people perceive and regulate threats and adopt political attitudes and behaviours to counter these threats.
In this project, we will be studying the explicit (self-reported) and implicit (psychophysiological) instantiations of threats and their interplay. To do this, the project will use an innovative mixed-methods design: in-depth interviews, cross-country surveys, survey experiments, and laboratory experiments, as well as intensive experience sampling studies that track threats over multiple days. The project description can be found here.

What are you going to do

The basic plans for the PhD projects are stated below. These will be adapted to the interest and expertise of the hired candidates.
PhD 1 focuses on the causes and consequences of societal threats. Research in political communication suggests elite cues cause people to see issues and events as threatening or not. Drawing upon appraisal theory (Scherer & Moors, 2019), one might expect that controllability and distance to the threat are causing threat perceptions. Step 1 in this project is to study the causes (elite cues, framing) that elicit perceptions of societal threats among citizens. In step 2, we will be exploring the causes of these societal threat perceptions to answer the question whether citizens adopt political attitudes and behaviours to counter the threat. The empirical approach of this project consists of survey-experiments, laboratory-based experiments using physiological measures (skin conductance, facial EMG) as well as eye-tracking, and computer-assisted content analysis.
PhD 2 focuses on the question to what extent citizens regulate societal threats, and to what extent does the regulation of threat condition the effects of threats on politics? In this project, we will be analysing the common threat regulation strategies in response to societal threats and their effect on political attitudes and behaviours to tackle the threat. In response to a threat, people could, for instance, engage in: cognitive reappraisal and reframe situations to change the emotional impact (e.g., climate change is threatening, but there is hope as climate change offers opportunities to recreate a better society); down-regulation and lower the intensity of the threat (about, for instance, climate change); or distraction and direct attention away from the threat (e.g., shifting attention from climate change to other (non-)political topics that are not threatening). PhD 2 will be exploring why, when and how people regulate societal and imagined threats and the consequences this has for the effects of threats on politics. The empirical approach consists of in-depth interviews, surveys, experience sampling (or diary) studies, and experiments.

Fully-funded PhD position in History of 20th-Century Philosophy (of Science),"Tilburg University | Tilburg School of Humanities and Digital Sciences Fully-funded PhD position in History of 20th-Century Philosophy (of Science) - ERC Project “Exiled Empiricists”

Department : Department of Philosophy
Location : Tilburg
Full time equivalent : 0,8 – 1,0 fte (32-40 hours per week)
Monthly full-time salary : € 2.541
Duration of employment contract : 1 year with an extension of 3 years (based on 1,0 fte)

The Department of Philosophy at Tilburg University seeks to appoint a PhD-researcher (4 or 5 years, 0,8 - 1,0 FTE) in the ERC StG/NWO Vidi project “Exiled Empiricists: American Philosophy and the Great Intellectual Migration”. Starting date: September 2023.

Job description
The candidate’s primary responsibility will be to write a dissertation and/or a series of academic papers on the institutional reception of refugee philosophers in the United States in the 1930s (working package B3 of the ERC research project, description below). They will study the records of American philosophy departments, journals and/or funding agencies and examine the processes that contributed to the successful (or unsuccessful) integration of different groups of philosophers. The researcher should also contribute to the project in other ways, such as attending the project meetings, giving conference presentations, and (co-)organizing reading groups and workshops. Furthermore, the candidate will be involved in teaching courses in our BA program and/or non-philosophy Bachelor programs (up to 10% of total task allocation) and will be a member of the Tilburg Center for Moral Philosophy, Epistemology and Philosophy of Science (TiLPS) and contribute to its colloquia and seminars.

The project
Exiled Empiricists: American Philosophy and the Great Intellectual Migration
The Exiled Empiricists project is funded by the European Research Council (ERC) and the Dutch Research Council (NWO) and led by Sander Verhaegh within the Tilburg Center for Moral Philosophy, Epistemology and Philosophy of Science (TiLPS), Tilburg University. The project currently employs three postdocs, a research assistant, and an external Ph.D. member.

Summary: In the 1930s, hundreds of European academics fled to the United States, escaping the quickly deteriorating political situation on the continent. Among them were a few dozen philosophers from a variety of schools: logical empiricists, critical theorists, and phenomenologists. Especially the first group would have a tremendous impact on American philosophy. Whereas the local intellectual climate had been dictated by American traditions like pragmatism, U.S. philosophers soon began to advance views that were heavily indebted to the empiricists. In fact, much of academic philosophy today is still shaped by the discussions and practices first instigated in this disruptive period.

Although historians have reconstructed the fate of the exiled empiricists, little attention has been paid to the American context in which their movement came to full bloom. This is surprising, since any account of the empiricists’ success requires an explanation of why the Americans were so receptive to their views. To what extent did developments in American philosophy pave the way for logical empiricism? And why was the American community more receptive to empiricism than to critical theory or phenomenology? This project shifts the perspective from the refugees to the local philosophical climate by 1) quantitatively analyzing thousands of American journal publications and 2) qualitatively examining the archives of dozens of key American philosophers and institutions.

A more detailed description of the project, including working package B3 (to which the PhD candidate will contribute), can be found on the project website.

Requirements position

Terms of employment
This is a position for 0,8 – 1,0 fte (32 - 40 hours per week) of full working hours. You will be given a temporary employment contract for the duration of 12 months, with a possible extension of 36 months.

The Faculty of Law, Institute for Information Law (IViR), and the University Research Priority Area on Trust in the Digital Society (TRUST RPA: https://www.ivir.nl/trust-in-the-digital-society-new-uva-research-priority-area/ ) is looking for a postdoctoral researcher to study the institutional safeguards of trustworthy centralized and decentralized techno-social infrastructures.

The TRUST RPA is a five year long interdisciplinary research initiative to study how we trust is changing due to the emergence of new trust production technologies, and the disruption of existing trust relations.

The digital society relies on an ever-expanding network of digital infrastructures. This forces us to rethink some of our basic assumptions about one of the most fundamental resources in all interpersonal, social, economic relations: trust.
Despite their widespread use, we know little about the trustworthiness of our digital infrastructures. At best it is difficult to establish their trustworthiness (such as with AI), at worst they are proven to be untrustworthy (as is the case with social media).
Some of these digital infrastructures play key roles in interpersonal and societal trust dynamics. They disrupt existing trust relations and offer new ways to trust each other.
Our scientific methods and theories face serious limits when it comes to the study of change of social structures, institutions, and processes under the conditions of rapid technological transformation. Research on trust in technology and trust by technology is siloed, and focuses on narrowly defined technologies (AI), or problems (system security), and lacks a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, long-term-view.

This postdoctoral position (embedded in the TRUST RPA, supervised by both the Institute for Information Law, at the Amsterdam Law School, and at least one other participating faculty) will use empirical research to study how various new technological infrastructures disrupt or can enhance existing societal (impersonal, institutional) trust relations and strive to establish new forms of trust relations in society.

What are you going to do?

 The successful candidate will:
Conduct empirical, qualitative research (interviews, case studies, discourse analysis) on the dynamics of institutional, impersonal trust with regards to emerging digital technologies, such as digital platforms, web3 technologies, or Machine Learning based automated systems.
Coordinate the development, fieldwork and initial analysis of a large-scale longitudinal survey
Conduct work on the emerging European technology regulation framework (Digital Services Act, AI Act, Digital Markets Act) using doctrinal research, normative research and discourse analysis
Organize events, conferences
Participate in grant proposal development, international network building
Acquiree funding

The Postdoctoral researcher will be hired by the Faculty of Law, closely collaborating with two other postdoctoral researchers in the Trust RPA. The team will be supervised by the PIs of the TRUS RPA: Balazs Bodo, Associate Professor at the Institute of Information Law (IViR) at the Faculty of Law, Jan B. Engelmann, Professor of Neuroeconomics at the Amsterdam School of Economics, Theo Araujo, Associate Professor Communication in the Digital Society at the Amsterdam School of Communication Research (ASCoR), Tom van Engers, Professor in Legal Knowledge Management at the University of Amsterdam, and Marc Tuters, Assistant Professor in the New Media and Digital Culture Division of Media Studies at the Faculty of Humanities.

What do we require of you?

 The successful candidate has:
a PhD degree in law, or social sciences (sociology, economics, political science, communication science, science and technology studies or related fields)
strong empirical research skills;

PhD position: Learning from food systems transitions – enabling community resilience,"Do you want to contribute to solving societal issues in the domain of food systems? Do you have a MSc degree in sociology, anthropology, development studies or related field with an interest in food systems? If yes, then we may be looking for you!

The Social Sciences Group (SSG) at Wageningen University is looking for a motivated PhD candidate to study relations between food system transitions and community resilience. The position is based in the Rural Sociology Group (RSO) and will be supervised by Professor Han Wiskerke and Dr Jessica Duncan with active supervision and collaboration with Dr Sietze Vellema from the Knowledge, Technology and Innovation Group (KTI), and Dr Marion Herens from Wageningen Centre for Development Innovation (WCDI).

Broad scope of the project
Advancing sustainable and inclusive development requires fundamental changes in the institutional architecture of food provisioning. Food insecurity continues to be major societal challenge, catalysed by the implications of climate change, biodiversity loss, pandemics, political conflicts, and war. Thus, unpredictability and uncertainty are major challenges currently confronting food provisioning systems.

A gap in research addressing these challenges relates to the prevailing assumptions and normative frames underlying (and reproducing) current food system rationalities. Solutions for the aforementioned challenges are often sought within formal food economies and globalized and industrialized agri-food value chains. As a result, the potential of highly contextual and self-organized forms of food provisioning is neglected or misunderstood. The PhD-project endeavours to not only problematize prevailing norms but also make visible alternatives.

The proposed PhD project will analyse and compare alternative and self-organized pathways for food system transition, with a specific interest in unravelling how local communities and small and medium food enterprises creatively respond to the challenges related to crises and risks affecting food and nutrition security. The PhD research will include an interest in pathways emerging in the Global South while allowing space for comparative research. We look for empirical studies of community or territorial-level mechanisms to expose what enables or constrains food provisioning systems to increase access to healthy, nutritious, affordable, and culturally appropriate food in the context of crises or shocks.

The starting point for the research is locally embedded initiatives, ranging from self-provisioning and food sharing to the ways in which smallholder producers, processors and traders are integrated into agri-food chains. Inserting knowledge from situated modus operandi into mainstream policy and practice may form an entry point for scaling resilient and self-organized practices and catalysing transformative processes. Studies will question:
How do self-organized food provisioning networks and markets emerge from or sustain in times of food crises, including those related to lockdowns?
How do community initiatives promote food security and healthy eating?
Which values are at stake, and which governance and/or organizational principles guide such efforts?
Wageningen University & Research offers excellent terms of employment. A few highlights from our Collective Labour Agreement include:

"Postdoc position in Digital Humanities, ERC StG/NWO Vidi Project ""Exiled Empiricists""","Tilburg University | Tilburg School of Humanities and Digital Sciences Postdoc position in Digital Humanities, ERC StG/NWO Vidi Project “Exiled Empiricists”

Department : Department of Philosophy
Location : Tilburg
Full time equivalent : 0,8 – 1,0 fte (32-40 hours per week)
Monthly full-time salary : € 2.960 - € 4.670
Duration of employment contract : 2 years (based on 1,0 fte)
The Department of Philosophy at Tilburg University seeks to appoint a postdoctoral researcher (2-3 years, 0.8-1,0 fte) in the ERC StG/NWO Vidi project “Exiled Empiricists: American Philosophy and the Great Intellectual Migration”. Starting date: September or October 2023.

Job description
The postdoc’s primary responsibility will be to contribute to a quantitative study of the development of American philosophy in the decades before and after World War II (working packages A1-A3 of the ERC research project, description below) and to publish in peer reviewed journals and books. The researcher should also contribute to the project in other ways, such as by giving conference presentations, (co-)editing a special issue, and (co-)organizing reading groups and workshops. Furthermore, the researcher will be a member of the Tilburg Center for Moral Philosophy, Epistemology and Philosophy of Science (TiLPS) and contribute to its colloquia and seminars. You will be working in a stimulating and dynamic interdisciplinary research environment. You will work in close collaboration with the project’s principal investigator and have regular team meetings with the other members of the group.

The project
Exiled Empiricists: American Philosophy and the Great Intellectual Migration
The Exiled Empiricists project is funded by the European Research Council (ERC) and the Dutch Research Council (NWO) and led by Sander Verhaegh within the Tilburg Center for Moral Philosophy, Epistemology and Philosophy of Science (TiLPS), Tilburg University. The project currently employs three postdocs, a research assistant, and an external Ph.D. member.

Summary: In the 1930s, hundreds of European academics fled to the United States, escaping the quickly deteriorating political situation on the continent. Among them were a few dozen philosophers from a variety of schools: logical empiricists, critical theorists, and phenomenologists. Especially the first group would have a tremendous impact on American philosophy. Whereas the local intellectual climate had been dictated by American traditions like pragmatism, U.S. philosophers soon began to advance views that were heavily indebted to the empiricists. In fact, much of academic philosophy today is still shaped by the discussions and practices first instigated in this disruptive period.

Although historians have reconstructed the fate of the exiled empiricists, little attention has been paid to the American context in which their movement came to full bloom. This is surprising, since any account of the empiricists’ success requires an explanation of why the Americans were so receptive to their views. To what extent did developments in American philosophy pave the way for logical empiricism? And why was the American community more receptive to empiricism than to critical theory or phenomenology? This project shifts the perspective from the refugees to the local philosophical climate by 1) quantitatively analyzing thousands of American journal publications and 2) qualitatively examining the archives of dozens of key American philosophers and institutions.

A more detailed description of the project, including the working packages A1-A3 (to which the postdoctoral researcher will contribute), can be found on the project website.

Requirements position
We are looking for a postdoctoral researcher who satisfies the following requirements:
A completed PhD in philosophy, computer science, history, computational linguistics or a related field.
Demonstrable knowledge of bibliometric methods such as topic modeling, citation analysis, and named entity recognition.
Solid programming skills in Python and optionally other programming languages (R is an asset).
A strong, promising track-record of international peer-reviewed publications
Affinity with the topic of the project
C1-level speaking and writing skills in English.
Knowledge of web development and/or databases is an advantage but not a requirement
Familiarity with network analysis/visualization software (e.g., Gephi, Pajek, VOSviewer) is an advantage but not a requirement.
Demonstrable research experience in philosophy, HPS, STS, intellectual history, or a related field in humanities is an advantage but not a requirement.

Terms of employment
This is a position for 0,8 – 1,0 fte (32 - 40 hours per week) of full working hours. This is a vacancy for which the work is temporarily externally funded by ERC - Exiled Empiricists. In accordance with Article 2.3 paragraph 5(a) of the CLA for Dutch Universities, you will be given a temporary employment contract for the duration of 24 months (based on 1,0 fte).

The Amsterdam School of Historical Studies (ASH) currently has a vacant Postdoc researcher position as part of the Dutch National Research Agenda (Nationale Wetenschapsagenda, NWA)-funded project Foreign Fighters in Ukraine: Mobilisations, Combat experiences, and Return trajectories, led by main researchers Dr Samuël Kruizinga (UvA) and Dr Elanie Rodermond (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam/NSCR). ASH is one of the five Research Schools within the Amsterdam Institute for Humanities Research.
What are you going to do?

Since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022, thousands of volunteer ""foreign fighters"" – including an unknown number of Dutchmen – have joined Ukraine’s International Legion. The research project Foreign Fighters in Ukraine: Mobilisations, Combat experiences, and Return trajectories’ central aim is to study both foreign fighting generally and increase our understanding of the International Legion specifically. Specifically, it aims to ascertain how the unique Ukrainian battlespace and the (social) media landscape shape mobilisations, combat experiences, and return trajectories of this iteration of the foreign fighter phenomenon.
You will, on the basis of currently available, but disparate historical data sets on foreign fighters in the 19th and 20th century, as well as contemporary information on returning Islamic State volunteers, set up hypotheses related to this project’s central aim. Then you will test these by making creative use of contemporary open sources on foreign fighter involvement in the Russo-Ukrainian war, including social media posts. Crucially, you will contact and then interview actual, potential and/or returning Dutch members of the International Legion.
Your research will be indispensable in increasing policy makers’ as well as mental health and legal experts’ ability to understand the ramifications of foreign fighting on both systemic and personal levels. Societal stakeholders in the overall project are ARQ Nationaal Psychotrauma Centrum, the Dutch national centre for specialist diagnostics and treatment of people with complex psychotraumatic complaints, ARQ Kenniscentrum Oorlog, Vervolging en Geweld, the prime Dutch knowledge centre for research on the psychosocial impact of war on individuals and society, the T.M.C. Asser Institute, which specialises in international (humanitarian) law and operates at the interface of academia, legal practice and governance, and the Nederlands Veteraneninstituut, which promotes the social recognition of combat veterans, and has expertise in and developed a working methodology for sensitive, post-mission interviews with combat veterans. Together with these stakeholders and project leaders Kruizinga and Rodermond you will contribute to a workshop to be organized by all subproject partners to bring together historical, legal, psychological, psychiatric, political and social science, experiential and government perspectives on foreign fighting in Ukraine and beyond; to a joint policy brief resulting from the workshop designed to disseminate public knowledge and influence policy; and to a podcast on foreign fighting.

Your tasks and responsibilities:
participating in meetings with the project leads and partners;
conducting research, presenting intermediate research results at workshops and conferences and publishing a single-authored, peer reviewed article;
co-organising knowledge dissemination activities (workshop, policy brief, podcast).

What do you have to offer?

We are looking for a team player with a research interest in the lived experiences of volunteers, who enjoys the challenges of new research areas and formats, relishes working within an interdisciplinary team, and is interested in communicating results to both various scientific communities and to a wider public.

Your experience and profile:
a PhD in history, criminology, anthropology, law, or related fields;
a strong cooperative attitude and willingness to engage in collaborative research;
experience with semi-structured interviews in research settings;

PhD Law and Innovation in Quantum Technologies,"PhD Law and Innovation in Quantum Technologies

Opleidingsniveau: Master
Functie type: Promotieplaats
Sluitingsdatum: 24.04.2023
Vacaturenummer: 11246
Do you want to study one of the core legal questions in emerging quantum technology value chains? And do you want to contribute to a vision on how the law can support equitable development of quantum technologies?

This PhD position on Law and Innovation in Quantum Technologies is part of the new research group on the law and governance of quantum technologies at the Institute for Information Law, University of Amsterdam. The Institute for Information Law is one of the largest research facilities in information law world-wide. The Institute brings together more than 40 researchers from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds. The research group is a part of Action line 4 on the Ethical, Legal And Societal Aspects of Quantum Technologies of the Quantum Delta NL ecosystem.

What are you going to do

Intellectual property in the broad sense plays a vital role in advanced technology industries. Over the last years, public and private investment in quantum technologies, including quantum computing, communications and sensing, have received a significant boost. Innovation and development of quantum technologies is giving rise to specific questions of law and global value chains. Private sector quantum innovation strategies rely on strong protection through patents, trade secrets and other (quasi) intellectual property. This raises questions in relation to competition and equitable access to advanced quantum technologies across different stakeholders and internationally. National science and technology policies attempt to support thriving national and transnational quantum technology ecosystems, seeking protection for knowledge and skilled personnel. Concentrations of private power and geo-political competition around quantum technology development may lead a world of quantum haves and have-nots, increasing global inequalities. Early initiatives relating to quantum technologies at the international level include calls for responsible tech development, and recognition of human rights guarantees and Sustainable Development Goals.

Building on insights from the work on Law and Global Value Chains (GVCs), this PhD will engage with the following questions. What role do law and legal practice in the area of law and innovation (intellectual property, including trade secrets, contract law) play in emergent quantum technology ecosystems? What alternative arrangements are or can be imagined in relation to quantum technology intellectual property portfolio’s, in particular to further equitable development, open innovation and access to quantum technologies? How does law support different positions and strategies of relevant actors, and how do other governance tools, such as standardization, help relevant actors address tensions between security and other interests? How might a clash between open quantum innovation and securitization of quantum technology production be resolved, also in light of a new European imperative of strategic autonomy?

The PhD project will be part of the research group on the Law and Governance of Quantum Technologies at the Institute for Information Law (IViR) at the Faculty of Law of the University of Amsterdam. You will conduct original cutting-edge research into the law and governance of quantum technologies with a focus on emerging legal practices relating to quantum technology development. You will develop insights into the way in which law relates to the increasingly constitutive function of digital infrastructure in our societies, by conducting different case studies in the area of quantum computing, communications and sensing. Using relevant theory, information law and fundamental rights law, technology governance studies, and empirical methods, you will contribute to our understanding of law and quantum technology ecosystems in Europe and internationally.

What do we require

a completed degree in law, or equivalent degree;
affinity with questions of intellectual property and private law a knowledgeable curiosity for developments in quantum technologies;
knowledge of current legal developments with respect to technology and innovation;
excellent academic credentials, as demonstrated by grades and/or curriculum vitae;
a creative mind and strong critical and analytical skills;
an interest in working across legal disciplines, using different methods (including empirical, theoretical and interdisciplinary), and collaborations with other relevant non-legal disciplines. Some knowledge or experience with conducting empirical research is a plus;
strong communication skills and a commitment to contributing to diverse and inclusive team dynamics;
excellent language skills in English and one or more other languages;

If the vacancy appeals to you, but you are doubting whether you might be THE person we are looking for, please do apply. We particularly welcome applications from candidates from underrepresented backgrounds.

Our offer

We offer a temporary full-time contract for the period of 4 years (with a go no go review assessment after the first year). The preferred starting date is 1 September 2023.

The salary, depending on relevant experience before the beginning of the employment contract, will be € 2,541 to € 3,247 (scale P) gross per month, based on a fulltime contract (38 hours a week).

Policy and Partnerships Director - New Opportunities (Bilingual English and French),"Who We Are

NewGlobe supports visionary governments to transform public education systems, the cornerstone of a prosperous, equitable, and peaceful society.

With a comprehensive system transformation platform and data-driven educational services, NewGlobe delivers rapid and dramatic improvements in learning outcomes at state and nationwide scale. Through building impactful partnerships and programmes, NewGlobe ensures that all children have access to an education that will develop their full potential and create a foundation for growth and prosperity.

NewGlobe leverages more than a decade of educational experience and proven impact in integrated school management, teacher professional development, instructional design innovation, technological system support, child-centered classroom practice, and parent engagement - all grounded in learning science - to ensure each teacher is empowered to engage children in transformational learning, and all children have the opportunity to develop to their full potential. Every day, NewGlobe supports governments to solve what were once seen as intractable problems, and by doing so, ensures this generation will be able to grow up to lead more fulfilled lives, while simultaneously building economic prosperity for themselves, their communities, and the globe.

NewGlobe's high-touch, intensive professional development programs, along with integrated school management, teacher support, and assessment software, enable schools to succeed. NewGlobe works within state and national curriculum and syllabi, ensuring all children are empowered to learn their own history, and master local content, while being globally competitive in mathematics and languages. The science of behaviour change and the science of learning is at the foundation of all programming.

NewGlobe works with urgency because youth quickly becomes adulthood and relentlessly because improvement requires continuous problem-solving. NewGlobe is honoured to serve and to help rebuild trust in public systems.

NewGlobe's work is all encompassing and will challenge you to use your full mind, and heart, each day. We need bright minds who want to be part of building a new globe - a more equitable globe - to join us.

Policy & Partnerships (Program Management)

The Policy & Partnerships team engages with visionary political and Government leadership to help shape policy, strengthen delivery and impact complex education systems through comprehensive technical support. We work to ensure policies support children's access, opportunity and advancement, and that there is an enabling environment for governments to work with technical assistance partners to enact large-scale system transformation. We ensure close collaboration, communication, and engagement with our government partners whom we serve in existing programs and the rest of the delivery teams to ensure we deliver on the promise of our program, and that the government sees solutions coming to the fore, and is participating in the work and recognizes the impact taking place. In support of the government program, may also engage with other dynamic influencers (NGOs, think-tanks, academicians, and bi- and multilateral agencies) to unlock additional support for our government programming and children in underserved communities. It is our responsibility to ensure that the program we deliver is understood by our government partner, and to negotiate any changes or updates or new needs in the program as it evolves, and to seek its expansion and renewal, based on successful track-record and measured improved learning and positive impact.

The New Opportunities Group

New Opportunities brings the majority of our extensive breadth of technical expertise to ensure large scale transformation of education systems into one team. This team kick-starts new programs in new countries (i.e. 'launch'). Each member of the team is responsible for a core area of expertise, and then setting up all work and functions related to that expertise in the new program/new country. This includes putting all relevant policies, practices, systems and technology in place, and leading the hiring of the leader who will take charge of this work as the permanent lead for this body of work.

This is our SWAT team, with specialists brought together to solve the critical and urgent problem of launching a state or nation-wide new program. This team must work collaboratively, thrive in creating order out of chaos, and understand that proactive problem solving is a daily task. All members of this team should expect extensive travel to remote and underserved areas, and to be resident in up to 5 other locations per year, setting up new programs. When not deployed on starting a specific program, each team member will do work with the core technical team which he or she represents, to support special projects, deepen technical knowledge, and otherwise advance in the field. This team is critical to delivering on our shared vision of transforming the lives of 10,000,000+ children, and in so doing seeing peace and prosperity where we work.

About the Role

As the Director, Policy and Partnerships, you'll oversee an entire program's large-scale, government-led, system-wide education transformation within all new locations. You are responsible for building and managing diverse stakeholder relationships, and focussed on account management and sustaining our work and operations in the territory. You own the government engagement with the diverse stakeholders and the many moving parts involved in our work in the territory. You are the first point of call for any communication between the program, the Government and other key stakeholders in the territory.

You'll be taking over existing relationships from the Policy and Partnerships Programme Development team and other Executives, and make these your own to ensure close collaboration and on-time execution of the program. This entails significant relationship management, as well as project management in ensuring data and approvals needed to pass between the government and program do so in a timely way for program deadlines. You will ensure that the government partners understand the program, and support its implementation. This will require coordination of stakeholder sessions, government workshops, and government public events and celebrations. During government workshops, there will be a need for careful engagement and collaboration on programme details - to be successful in this role, you must learn about all aspects of our programming, and what can be negotiated and what cannot to ensure we deliver on what the government requires of us - improved learning outcomes. You will need to be diplomatic and have discretion; know when to speak and when to listen.

You're also
A detailed doer – You have a track record of getting things done. You're organized and responsive. You take ownership of every idea you touch and execute it to a fine level of detail, setting targets, engaging others, and doing whatever it takes to get the job done. You can multi-task dozens of such projects at once and never lose sight of the details. Likely, you have some experience in a start-up or other rapid-growth company.
A networking mastermind – You excel at meeting new people and turning them into advocates. You communicate in a clear, conscientious, and effective way in both written and oral speech. You can influence strangers in the course of a single conversation. Allies and colleagues will go to bat for your ideas. You have an existing network from prior experience in the country, preferably in the regulatory, education, or business sectors.
A creative problem-solver – Growing any business from scratch comes with massive and constant challenges. On top of that, NewGlobe works in often fragile, sometimes volatile low-resource communities and with complex government systems. You need to be flexible and ready to get everything done effectively, quickly, and affordably with the materials at hand.
A relentless advocate –The children we serve and teachers we empower never leave your mind. You know them, get them, have shared a meal with them (or would be happy to in the future). You would never shrink back from shaking a parent's hand or picking up a crying child, no matter what the person was wearing or looked like. Every decision you make considers their benefit, experience,

and value.
A malleable learner –You believe you can always do better. You welcome constructive criticism and provide it freely to others. You know you only get better tomorrow when others point out where you've missed things or failed today.
A data-driven decision-maker – When making decisions, you don't rely on your intuition alone. You collect data, you analyze it and make decisions with clear justifications.
A curious investigator – You ask why a lot. You don't just take what you see and accept it. You wonder why it is that way, and are aware that the world we see is created by human choices and actions – and it could be different. You wonder, and see the world as wonderful even when you want to change a part of it that is unjust.
