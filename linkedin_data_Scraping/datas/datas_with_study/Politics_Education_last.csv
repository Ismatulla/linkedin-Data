PhDs for project about the causes and consequences of societal threat perceptions,"2 PhDs for project about the causes and consequences of societal threat perceptions
Faculteit/Dienst: Faculteit der Maatschappij- & Gedragswetenschappen
Opleidingsniveau: Master
Functie type: Promotieplaats
Sluitingsdatum: 17 April 2023
Vacaturenummer: 11360
We are looking for 2 PhD candidates to join a new research project lead by Dr. Bert N. Bakker (PI), supported by an NWO VIDI grant. The project is embedded in the Hot Politics Lab (an interdisciplinary research group focusing on political psychology) and the Amsterdam School of Communication Research at the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences.
This project starts with the observations that with a pandemic, the war in Ukriane, climate change, terrorist attacks, and financial meltdowns, we have in the last twenty years experienced multiple threats that potentially could have (or will in the future) fundamentally alter our way of life. Threats have adverse effects when they erode democratic stability by sparking violence and fuelling support for anti-democratic politics. However, threats might benefit society when they trigger desired behaviour, such as reducing the eco-footprint or getting a vaccination. Given the complex role of threat in society, it is crucial to understand better the processes underlying people's threat perceptions and develop strategies for mitigating the adverse effects and stimulating the beneficial effects of threat perceptions on democracy and society. This project bridges theories from communication science, psychology, and neuroscience by the overarching research question: How do people perceive and regulate threats and adopt political attitudes and behaviours to counter these threats.
In this project, we will be studying the explicit (self-reported) and implicit (psychophysiological) instantiations of threats and their interplay. To do this, the project will use an innovative mixed-methods design: in-depth interviews, cross-country surveys, survey experiments, and laboratory experiments, as well as intensive experience sampling studies that track threats over multiple days. The project description can be found here.

What are you going to do

The basic plans for the PhD projects are stated below. These will be adapted to the interest and expertise of the hired candidates.
PhD 1 focuses on the causes and consequences of societal threats. Research in political communication suggests elite cues cause people to see issues and events as threatening or not. Drawing upon appraisal theory (Scherer & Moors, 2019), one might expect that controllability and distance to the threat are causing threat perceptions. Step 1 in this project is to study the causes (elite cues, framing) that elicit perceptions of societal threats among citizens. In step 2, we will be exploring the causes of these societal threat perceptions to answer the question whether citizens adopt political attitudes and behaviours to counter the threat. The empirical approach of this project consists of survey-experiments, laboratory-based experiments using physiological measures (skin conductance, facial EMG) as well as eye-tracking, and computer-assisted content analysis.
PhD 2 focuses on the question to what extent citizens regulate societal threats, and to what extent does the regulation of threat condition the effects of threats on politics? In this project, we will be analysing the common threat regulation strategies in response to societal threats and their effect on political attitudes and behaviours to tackle the threat. In response to a threat, people could, for instance, engage in: cognitive reappraisal and reframe situations to change the emotional impact (e.g., climate change is threatening, but there is hope as climate change offers opportunities to recreate a better society); down-regulation and lower the intensity of the threat (about, for instance, climate change); or distraction and direct attention away from the threat (e.g., shifting attention from climate change to other (non-)political topics that are not threatening). PhD 2 will be exploring why, when and how people regulate societal and imagined threats and the consequences this has for the effects of threats on politics. The empirical approach consists of in-depth interviews, surveys, experience sampling (or diary) studies, and experiments.
What do you have to offer

You are:
eager to contribute to the scientific field;
curious to combine insights from communication science, political science and psychology, both theoretically and methodologically;
motivated to share your knowledge with academic and non-academic audiences;
strongly committed to methodological rigor and scientific integrity;
curious and eager to learn new skills, theoretical perspectives and practical issues;
motivated to contribute to the Hot Politics Lab and Amsterdam School of Communication Research.

Your experience and profile:

You have:
a (Research) Master’s degree in Communication Science, Political Science, Psychology or a related field;
experience with physiological or eye-tracking data acquisition and data analysis is highly desired (especially in case of PhD 1);
a firm basis in and ideally experience with research methods and data analysis, in particular: experimentation (survey & laboratory), computer-assisted content analysis ( in case of PhD 1), and experience sampling studies (in case of PhD 2);
experience in and commitment to engage work following open science principles such as replication and preregistration (including power analyses);
basic programming skills (in R or Python) or high motivation to learn scientific computing;
an excellent written and spoken command of English,
being able to speak and write in Dutch is desirable but not necessary;
excellent social and organizational skills.

What can we offer you

The planned start date is September 1st, 2023 but there is some flexibility about the starting date. The position concerns temporary employment of 1.0 fte (38 hours per week) for a maximum term of 4 years. The initial employment is for one year. Following a positive assessment and barring altered circumstances, this term will be extended by a maximum of 36 months, which should result in the conferral of a doctorate. In consultation with the supervision team, the successful candidate will design a custom curriculum which will also include the opportunity to attend training courses and both national and international events. Teaching can be part of the tasks.

Your salary will be €2541 gross per month in the first year and will increase to €3247 in the final year, based on full-time employment and in keeping with the Collective Labour Agreement of Dutch Universities. We additionally offer an extensive package of secondary benefits, including 8% holiday allowance and a year-end bonus of 8.3%.

Assistant Professor (Universitair Docent) in Social and Cultural Anthropology,"Are you an anthropologist dedicated to research, teaching and making an impact both within and outside academia? Do you operate well in teams and feel committed to your colleagues, students and the people you do research with? Then please apply for this vacancy at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam!


Location: AMSTERDAM

Job description
The Department of Social and Cultural Anthropology of Vrije University Amsterdam is searching for a new assistant professor. The department stands out in the Netherlands and worldwide as a research group focused on making a scientific impact within and outside academia. We practice anthropology and ethnography with direct participation of and relevance to research participants and in the interest of non-academic and broader audiences. We also teach our students ways to apply anthropology in their future careers.


The impact we aim to have is transformative and emancipatory for research participants, stakeholders, and society. The research engagement starts with societal demands, challenges, and questions about inequality and injustice. We do not claim instant solutions but try to ask better questions. We are committed to long-term engagement.


As an assistant professor, you will be active in teaching, do research and play a significant role in our Ethnographic Impact Lab. The standard allocation of time is 65% for teaching, 30% for research, and 5% for administrative tasks; external funding may increase research time. However, all staff is always required to teach, and we value good teaching as much as good research.


The department is responsible for a bachelor and master programme in anthropology and contributes to courses given to all disciplines of the Faculty of Social Sciences, the Research Master in social sciences, and the graduate school for PhD students. The bachelor programme is offered in English and Dutch, and the master's is in English; the coming academic year we will begin a new professional track in our master’s. Your teaching tasks will be aligned with the teaching done by other team members.


Our research is organised into a thematic programme called Mobilities, Beliefs, and Belonging: Confronting Global Inequalities and Insecurities, which is currently under review. The departments’ ethnographic research covers various subdisciplines in anthropology and development studies and is conducted in many different countries. You will have considerable autonomy to develop your line of research and this position is open to a wide range of subject specialisms. For example, we welcome expertise in multimodal methodologies and digital anthropology, and anthropologists working on borders and identities, to name just a few possibilities. However, you are expected to broadly engage one of two research themes from the national Sectorplan for Social Sciences: “Inequality & diversity”, or “Human impact and new technology”.


Alongside our teaching and research, we are developing an Ethnographic Impact Lab to frame and reinforce our research group's engagement and societal advancements.

Requirements
You hold a PhD in anthropology or a related discipline with substantial anthropological work experience. Given the period since your PhD, you have a good publication record and a demonstrable skill to write competitive external research grant applications. You have experience with high-quality teaching, and you have a well-informed opinion about appropriate and innovative teaching styles and techniques.

Professor of Architectural and Urban History,"Professor of Architectural and Urban History
Faculteit/Dienst: Faculteit der Geesteswetenschappen
Opleidingsniveau: Gepromoveerd
Functie type: Wetenschappelijk Personeel
Sluitingsdatum: 26 April 2023
Vacaturenummer: 11325
The Faculty of Humanities employs just under 1,000 employees, and approximately 8,000 students study there. The faculty consists of eight departments: Philosophy, Dutch Studies, Media Studies, Art and Cultural Studies, History, European Studies and Religious Studies, Amsterdam Centre for Ancient Studies and Archaeology, Modern Foreign Languages and Cultures, and Literature and Linguistics. Each department is composed of capacity groups, which consist of one or more professors and a number of employees who work in the relevant field.

The Department of Art and Cultural Studies has a vacancy for a full professorship in:

Architectural and Urban History 1,0 FTE (permanent position)

What will you do?

Context of the chair
The Professor of Architectural and Urban History is affiliated with the Amsterdam School of Historical Studies (ASH) and the Arts and Culture department (more specifically the Art History chair group). The basis for the chair is the historical approach of architecture from an art history perspective: this is of fundamental importance in order to ensure the necessary broad Humanities outlook for interdisciplinary research and teaching within and outside the UvA. In addition, the perspective will be broadened to include urban history, with special attention in the research dedicated to the experience of the urban environment; a more international interpretation that does not yet exist in the Netherlands. The new colleague to be appointed will therefore have architectural history experience with an added focus on contemporary urban history and urban design history, as well as the interplay between the built and natural environment, in which environmental history experience (the role of the historical city in its natural environment) is extremely desirable. The focus in this regard will be on a historical perspective that can be linked to modern-day problems of the urban and architectural living environment. This means that expertise in various approaches to the built environment, for example based on experience of the living environment (perception of the environment) will be expected.
The professor will be responsible, in particular, for teaching in the Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Art History, as well as in the Bachelor in Global Arts, Culture and Politics. The professor will play a significant role in both the teaching for the Master’s track Stadsgeschiedenis (Urban History) within the department of History, European Studies and Religious Studies and for various other degree programmes. In addition, the new professor is expected to undertake administrative tasks.

The chair will provide a strong starting point for the aforementioned collaborations within the University, but also with researchers and external institutions, such as Arcam, Het Nieuwe Instituut, the Cultural Heritage Agency, urban authorities and NGOs. The professor is expected to play a leading role in these types of collaborations.

Teaching
The professor will first be responsible for the Architectural History components within the Art History capacity group (capaciteitsgroep Kunstgeschiedenis). Architectural History is one of the four chair groups within the Art History capacity group, in addition to Medieval Art History (Middeleeuwse kunstgeschiedenis), Art History of the Early Modern Period (Kunstgeschiedenis van de nieuwere tijd), and Modern and Contemporary Art History (Moderne en hedendaagse kunstgeschiedenis). Approximately a quarter of the compulsory curriculum of the BA is therefore provided by the Architectural History chair group. In addition to these components, Architectural History also provides three successful BA specialisations, which can also be taken as electives (see also Minor): Ontwerpen voor de moderne stad (Designing for the Modern City); Dit is Amsterdam: identiteit en beeldvorming in kunst en architectuur (This is Amsterdam: identity and perception in art and architecture) and Reparatie en imitatie. Over het gebouwde erfgoed in het ‘eigentijdse’ Amsterdam. Over het gebouwde erfgoed in het 'eigentijdse' Amsterdam. (Repair and imitation. About the built heritage in ‘contemporary Amsterdam).

Secondly, the professor will make an important contribution to the minor Architectuur en Stedenbouw (minor in Architecture and Urban Planning). This is taken annually by approx. 20 students (mostly Human Geography, Urban and Regional Planning, and Geography students, in addition to students from other studies, including English, Economics, Communication Science, Philosophy, Sociology and Anthropology). The minor also provides a basis for the interdisciplinary Master’s track Stadsgeschiedenis (Urban History, department of History, European Studies and Religious Studies: approx. 5 minor students move on to this track annually. Finally, the professor will play an important role in the BA programme Global Arts, Culture and Politics, particularly the major in Sustainability).

Research
The professor will conduct research within the research school Amsterdam School of Historical Studies (ASH). It is important for the research school that the professor’s research ties in with the new methodological and theoretical developments within architectural history that also considers, in addition to the built environment, the urban perception of the environment from a social perspective and sensory experience. An additional expertise in the interplay between the built and natural environment is desirable. The new professor will take a central position within the Centre for Urban History within ASH. This centre has developed into an important pillar within ASH for interdisciplinary research into the history of the city from antiquity to the present day, with approximately 35 staff members from various disciplines. The professor is expected to assume a connecting and guiding role within this centre. In addition, the professor will be responsible for setting up broad interdisciplinary collaborations with researchers within the Faculty of Humanities (FGw) and the University of Amsterdam (UvA), for example with Urban Studies within the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences (FMG), leading to individual or group applications for research financing (ERC, NWO, NWA, etc.). In addition, an international orientation (with corresponding network) is desirable in order to guarantee the leading role of the chair in Amsterdam within a field that is increasingly globally oriented.
The newly appointed professor is further expected to have knowledge of contemporary, innovative and digital research methods, which provide insight into issues about the digital built environment, the digital city (also an important theme within the MA track Urban History) and the living environment, and to collaborate with researchers in Creative Amsterdam: An E-Humanities perspective, and the 4D-Research Lab.

It is expected that the professor to be appointed will be able to enthuse and mentor young researchers; that the professor will have experience in PhD supervision and be able to contribute to creating a safe and stimulating environment for PhD candidates. The professor will also bear responsibility for actively recruiting PhD candidates by means of submitting grant applications in the Netherlands and abroad.

Leadership
The professor to be appointed will preside over the Architectural History chair group with five staff members, which will include two lecturers, a professor by special appointment and two assistant professors, and will have to perform administrative duties at the level of the educational administration (programme director BA of MA), research organisation (e.g. research director of ASH or the national research school for art history) and/or at departmental level (capacity group chair Art History, departmental chair Arts and Culture). Expansion of the administrative capacity is needed within these various levels. Given the desire to create an environment for employees and students that is safe and inclusive, it is of vital importance that the professor to be appointed possesses organisational sensitivity and exercises leadership that is appropriate in this regard.

Your tasks and responsibilities:
teaching Architectural and Urban History, including supervising Bachelor’s and Master’s theses;
contributing to innovation and improvement of the curriculum in the field of Architectural and Urban History;
addressing research themes and projects within the chair group and research groups;
actively pursuing external funding for research, notably funding from research councils, on national as well as European level;
carrying out HR responsibilities within the Architectural History chair group;
carrying out administrative and management tasks within the Department and Faculty.

What expertise do we require of you?

Successful candidates for the position are expected to meet the following requirements.
You:
hold a PhD in Architectural History or a related academic field;
have an excellent international academic reputation and publication profile, which match the research themes of ASH;
have an affinity with inclusive, polyphonous historical scholarship and digital methods;
are an experienced and engaged teacher at all levels of academic training;
have expertise in developing and renewing teaching programmes at Bachelor’s and Master’s levels;
can show a track record of applying for/acquiring external research funding;
have experience with attracting and supervising PhD projects and junior researchers;
have proven management and leadership qualities and are a dedicated administrator;
have a broad national and international network with academic and cultural institutions;
have an affinity with outreach and knowledge exchange beyond academic settings;
have a Dutch Basic Teaching Qualification, or a willingness to acquire one within the first two years of your appointment;
have a good command of Dutch and English. If you are not fluent in Dutch, you have a willingness to pass the State Exam Dutch as a Second Language (NT2), programme II within two years of the employment contract. The Faculty will assist in this process.

Please also check the document ‘Information about chairs at the Faculty of Humanities’ for more information.
We are committed to a culturally and intellectually diverse academic community and are especially interested in candidates who can contribute, through their research, teaching and/or service, to this mission. We particularly encourage people from underrepresented groups to apply.

Our offer

The appointment will be permanent. The gross salary will normally conform to professorial scale 2, between € 6,099 and € 8,881 gross per month (€ 85,117 - € 123,943 per annum, including 8% holiday pay and an 8.3% end-of-year payment) on a full-time basis (38 hours per week) in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities (CAO NU). In certain cases, however, different terms of employment may be offered.

PhD in more-than-human landscapes of design,"Job description
Human-centered thinking has contributed to problems of our time, including climate change and social inequality. More-than-human theories, philosophies and approaches offer alternatives to this central mode of understanding the world, and our design practices.
While the importance of these approaches is increasingly recognized as important in the fields of design and HCI, there are relatively few design examples, and rarely do they account for the materials, tools and processes of design itself.

There is a need to engage with more-than-human thinking and its open challenges more deeply, both in and through design. What are the interrelations of more-than-human thinking and decolonialism? How might we design tools to help us listen to the land?
What might be considerations of nonhuman justice and material ethics? Such challenges require a humble approach, in which we as designers are finding ways to be comfortable with, and act within the unknown.

The concept of the landscape allows for a broader understanding of the larger ecology and multitude of relations at play in design. This PhD will engage with these topics and engage with indirect land-relations that are at the infrastructure of human-computer interaction, such as underwater cables enabling internet networks, and negotiations of 4G architecture.
There is an opportunity - and a responsibility - to better understand these relations through design. This is an intentionally broad framing that can include, for example, enabling creative collaborations with the weather, telling soil stories about cloud technologies, finding ways to speak for the needs of trees and investigations into the politics of land in more-than-human thinking.

Job requirements
A master’s degree (or an equivalent university degree) in a design related field.
A research-oriented attitude and an open, curious mind.
A willingness to stay with the trouble and to simultaneously learn and unlearn.
Fluent in spoken and written English (C1 level).
Conditions of employment
A meaningful job in a dynamic and ambitious university, in an interdisciplinary setting and within an international network. You will work on a beautiful, green campus within walking distance of the central train station. In addition, we offer you:
Full-time employment for four years, with an intermediate evaluation (go/no-go) after nine months. You will spend 10% of your employment on teaching tasks.
Salary and benefits (such as a pension scheme, paid pregnancy and maternity leave, partially paid parental leave) in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities, scale 27 (min. €2,541 max. €3,247).
A year-end bonus of 8.3% and annual vacation pay of 8%.
High-quality training programs and other support to grow into a self-aware, autonomous scientific researcher. At TU/e we challenge you to take charge of your own learning process.
An excellent technical infrastructure, on-campus children's day care and sports facilities.
An allowance for commuting, working from home and internet costs.
A Staff Immigration Team and a tax compensation scheme (the 30% facility) for international candidates.

Project 1. Geographies of Discontent: Understanding Protest and Regional Resentment in the Northern Netherlands

Supervisors:
Dr Léonie de Jonge (YAG, Faculty of Arts, Assistant Professor in European Politics & Society)
Dr Koen Salemink (Faculty of Spatial Sciences, Assistant Professor in Cultural Geography)
Dr Sander van Lanen (YAG, Faculty of Spatial Sciences, Assistant Professor in Cultural
Geography)

Project description:
This project combines cultural geography and political science to examine spatial patterns and drivers of feelings of discontent, and how these feelings translate (or not) in protest events with a specific focus on the Northern Netherlands (i.e. the provinces of Drenthe, Friesland and Groningen). This region is characterized by both diverse and specific problems linked to peripherality, earthquakes and large-scale renewable energy projects. As such, it forms an ideal environment to examine the geographies of regional discontent. The broader aim of the project is to better understand geographical differences in discontent, protest, and their underlying mechanisms.

Western democracies are currently witnessing a growing sense of social discontent, characterized by declining levels of trust in governments and institutions, and rising support for populist and extremist movements. These trends have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the so-called ‘refugee crisis’, and the ongoing nitrogen and energy crises in the Netherlands. These developments contributed to rising anti-government sentiments and (at times violent) protests.

Such feelings of discontent and protest incidents are traditionally concentrated in places that allegedly ‘don’t matter’. In the Netherlands, this territorially-rooted discontent, also known as ‘place resentment’, manifests itself in feelings of resentment of the periphery towards the center (i.e. the Randstad). Yet, we know little about the exact nature of this regional resentment. For instance, national media tend to represent rural resentment rather homogeneously, while rural scholars maintain that rural places and communities are very diverse, and urban scholars call for attention to ‘peripheries within the center’. This begs the question whether one can speak of an urban-rural divide, especially since cultural geographers redirect our attention to studying urban-rural, intra-rural, and intra-urban divides.

Regardless of the exact nature of the divide, there is growing evidence that spatial patterns of regional and rural resentment can be discerned. This raises the following questions, which form the backbone of this project: what are the main drivers for regional discontent? How, when and where does it manifest itself? How do these drivers of discontent differ through space, and when and how do they turn into protest activities? And why do some issues result in (violent) protest, while others do not?

Interdisciplinary Focus
This project studies regional resentment and discontent at the intersection of political science and cultural geography. Political science provides us with theories to understand processes behind regional resentment and radicalisation. Cultural geography offers frameworks to understand why and how this resentment concentrates in particular places. This project combines both disciplines to shed new light on pressing societal questions that have been raised by both disciplines, but for which the disciplines individually can only offer partial explanations. This interdisciplinary approach can help explain how place and geographical context affect protest and political preferences and offer new insights on “place resentment”.

Project 2. A PhD Project that crosses the disciplines of two Young Academy Groningen members

If you have your own project idea that you would like to submit, please contact YAG members to discuss your ideas and the possibilities of submitting a joint proposal. (Note: This cross-disciplinary project must list at least two supervisors, of whom two are Young Academy Groningen members).

Qualifications

Project 1
The ideal candidate would need to have several if not all of the following qualities:

an Master’s degree (MA/MSc) in one of the disciplines that form the backbone of the project (i.e. either in political science, cultural/ human geography, or other relevant social science), with a keen interest in the key disciplines
a clear research interest in the topic of the project (i.e. is intrinsically motivated)
is willing to develop skills in either political science or geography (e.g. willingness to be trained in geographical information systems or acquire knowledge and expertise on relevant political science methods and literatures)
is committed to work autonomously in an interdisciplinary team setting
a demonstrably excellent written and spoken command of English (written and spoken command of Dutch is a definite asset).

Postdoctoral researcher studying the institutional forms of societal trust in the digital society,"Postdoctoral researcher studying the institutional forms of societal trust in the digital society
Faculteit/Dienst: Faculteit der Rechtsgeleerdheid
Opleidingsniveau: Gepromoveerd
Functie type: Wetenschappelijk Personeel
Sluitingsdatum: 15.04.2023
Vacaturenummer: 11262
The Faculty of Law, Institute for Information Law (IViR), and the University Research Priority Area on Trust in the Digital Society (TRUST RPA: https://www.ivir.nl/trust-in-the-digital-society-new-uva-research-priority-area/ ) is looking for a postdoctoral researcher to study the institutional safeguards of trustworthy centralized and decentralized techno-social infrastructures.

The TRUST RPA is a five year long interdisciplinary research initiative to study how we trust is changing due to the emergence of new trust production technologies, and the disruption of existing trust relations.

The digital society relies on an ever-expanding network of digital infrastructures. This forces us to rethink some of our basic assumptions about one of the most fundamental resources in all interpersonal, social, economic relations: trust.
Despite their widespread use, we know little about the trustworthiness of our digital infrastructures. At best it is difficult to establish their trustworthiness (such as with AI), at worst they are proven to be untrustworthy (as is the case with social media).
Some of these digital infrastructures play key roles in interpersonal and societal trust dynamics. They disrupt existing trust relations and offer new ways to trust each other.
Our scientific methods and theories face serious limits when it comes to the study of change of social structures, institutions, and processes under the conditions of rapid technological transformation. Research on trust in technology and trust by technology is siloed, and focuses on narrowly defined technologies (AI), or problems (system security), and lacks a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, long-term-view.

This postdoctoral position (embedded in the TRUST RPA, supervised by both the Institute for Information Law, at the Amsterdam Law School, and at least one other participating faculty) will use empirical research to study how various new technological infrastructures disrupt or can enhance existing societal (impersonal, institutional) trust relations and strive to establish new forms of trust relations in society.

What are you going to do?

 The successful candidate will:
Conduct empirical, qualitative research (interviews, case studies, discourse analysis) on the dynamics of institutional, impersonal trust with regards to emerging digital technologies, such as digital platforms, web3 technologies, or Machine Learning based automated systems.
Coordinate the development, fieldwork and initial analysis of a large-scale longitudinal survey
Conduct work on the emerging European technology regulation framework (Digital Services Act, AI Act, Digital Markets Act) using doctrinal research, normative research and discourse analysis
Organize events, conferences
Participate in grant proposal development, international network building
Acquiree funding

The Postdoctoral researcher will be hired by the Faculty of Law, closely collaborating with two other postdoctoral researchers in the Trust RPA. The team will be supervised by the PIs of the TRUS RPA: Balazs Bodo, Associate Professor at the Institute of Information Law (IViR) at the Faculty of Law, Jan B. Engelmann, Professor of Neuroeconomics at the Amsterdam School of Economics, Theo Araujo, Associate Professor Communication in the Digital Society at the Amsterdam School of Communication Research (ASCoR), Tom van Engers, Professor in Legal Knowledge Management at the University of Amsterdam, and Marc Tuters, Assistant Professor in the New Media and Digital Culture Division of Media Studies at the Faculty of Humanities.

What do we require of you?

 The successful candidate has:
a PhD degree in law, or social sciences (sociology, economics, political science, communication science, science and technology studies or related fields)
strong empirical research skills;
familiarity with qualitative research methods,
familiarity with doctrinal research or policy research;
good knowledge of current developments in information markets and technology;
academic excellence, as shown in the grade transcripts and curriculum vitae.
a creative mind and analytical intelligence;
an interest in working in a multidisciplinary team;
willingness to learn new knowledge, and acquire new skills required by the project;
excellent written and spoken command of English, and ideally knowledge of Dutch
interest in working on interdisciplinary topics, in interdisciplinary teams.

Candidates, who have:
quantitative skills, including survey development, statistical analysis, and/or
familiarity with R, python or any other programming language, and/or
big data collection and analysis skills, and/or
previous experience in the private or public sector

will be given extra consideration in the application process.

We strongly encourage members of broadly understood minority socio-cultural groups to apply. We believe that there are several traditionally underrepresented, but incredibly forceful perspectives, that have transformed our respective disciplines. Recent scholarship by persons of colour, feminist, intersectionalist scholars, scholars from the Global South have highlighted fundamental issues with the design, operation, and impact of techno-social systems that remained in the blind spots of mainstream scholarship. Without such contributions, serious problems, such as racial bias in AI systems, would have gone unnoticed and left unaddressed by more careful technical design and better regulation.

Our offer

We offer a temporary employment contract for 38 hours per week for a period of 36 months with a probationary period of two months. The preferred starting date is as soon possible.
The gross monthly salary, based on 30,4 -38 (0.8-1 FTE) hours per week and dependent on relevant experience, ranges between € 2,960 to € 4,670 (scale 10). UvA additionally offers an extensive package of secondary benefits, including 8% holiday allowance and a year-end bonus of 8.3%. The UFO profile Researcher 4 is applicable. A favourable tax agreement, the ‘30% ruling’, may apply to non-Dutch applicants. The Collective Labour Agreement of Universities of the Netherlands is applicable.

Besides the salary and a vibrant and challenging environment we offer you multiple fringe benefits:
232 holiday hours per year (based on fulltime) and extra holidays between Christmas and 1 January;
Multiple courses to follow from our Teaching and Learning Centre;
Multiple courses on topics such as leadership for academic staff;
Multiple courses on topics such as time management, handling stress and an online learning platform with 100+ different courses;
7 weeks birth leave (partner leave) with 100% salary;
Partly paid parental leave;
The possibility to set up a workplace at home;
A pension at ABP for which UvA pays two third part of the contribution;
The possibility to follow courses to learn Dutch;

What else do we offer
the possibility to start up and grow a New Research priority Area at the UvA,
close working relations with five faculties of the UvA; and with TU Delft, and Erasmus University, Rotterdam
freedom to develop your own research agenda;
welcoming, international, dynamic teams;
an inspiring academic and professional environment in the heart of Amsterdam;
excellent possibilities for further professional development and education.

Do you want to study one of the core legal questions in emerging quantum technology value chains? And do you want to contribute to a vision on how the law can support equitable development of quantum technologies?

This PhD position on Law and Innovation in Quantum Technologies is part of the new research group on the law and governance of quantum technologies at the Institute for Information Law, University of Amsterdam. The Institute for Information Law is one of the largest research facilities in information law world-wide. The Institute brings together more than 40 researchers from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds. The research group is a part of Action line 4 on the Ethical, Legal And Societal Aspects of Quantum Technologies of the Quantum Delta NL ecosystem.

What are you going to do

Intellectual property in the broad sense plays a vital role in advanced technology industries. Over the last years, public and private investment in quantum technologies, including quantum computing, communications and sensing, have received a significant boost. Innovation and development of quantum technologies is giving rise to specific questions of law and global value chains. Private sector quantum innovation strategies rely on strong protection through patents, trade secrets and other (quasi) intellectual property. This raises questions in relation to competition and equitable access to advanced quantum technologies across different stakeholders and internationally. National science and technology policies attempt to support thriving national and transnational quantum technology ecosystems, seeking protection for knowledge and skilled personnel. Concentrations of private power and geo-political competition around quantum technology development may lead a world of quantum haves and have-nots, increasing global inequalities. Early initiatives relating to quantum technologies at the international level include calls for responsible tech development, and recognition of human rights guarantees and Sustainable Development Goals.

Building on insights from the work on Law and Global Value Chains (GVCs), this PhD will engage with the following questions. What role do law and legal practice in the area of law and innovation (intellectual property, including trade secrets, contract law) play in emergent quantum technology ecosystems? What alternative arrangements are or can be imagined in relation to quantum technology intellectual property portfolio’s, in particular to further equitable development, open innovation and access to quantum technologies? How does law support different positions and strategies of relevant actors, and how do other governance tools, such as standardization, help relevant actors address tensions between security and other interests? How might a clash between open quantum innovation and securitization of quantum technology production be resolved, also in light of a new European imperative of strategic autonomy?

The PhD project will be part of the research group on the Law and Governance of Quantum Technologies at the Institute for Information Law (IViR) at the Faculty of Law of the University of Amsterdam. You will conduct original cutting-edge research into the law and governance of quantum technologies with a focus on emerging legal practices relating to quantum technology development. You will develop insights into the way in which law relates to the increasingly constitutive function of digital infrastructure in our societies, by conducting different case studies in the area of quantum computing, communications and sensing. Using relevant theory, information law and fundamental rights law, technology governance studies, and empirical methods, you will contribute to our understanding of law and quantum technology ecosystems in Europe and internationally.

What do we require

a completed degree in law, or equivalent degree;
affinity with questions of intellectual property and private law a knowledgeable curiosity for developments in quantum technologies;
knowledge of current legal developments with respect to technology and innovation;
excellent academic credentials, as demonstrated by grades and/or curriculum vitae;
a creative mind and strong critical and analytical skills;

Developing organizational arrangements for artificial intelligence in public surveillance
Job description
We are looking for an enthusiastic PhD candidate with a background in the field of policy analysis, public administration, policy sciences or a related field to study and develop organizational implementation arrangements for Artificial Intelligence (AI) for regulatory surveillance. The position is a for 4-year PhD track, financed by the Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management, department of Multi-Actor Systems in close collaboration with regulatory agencies.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly used in regulatory processes. No wonder, AI promises a more effective regulatory supervision process, in which inspectors on the floor are advised on the basis of AI-generated risk analysis. Technically there are still many development possibilities. However, whether AI can be applied effectively and responsibly also raises organizational issues, such as:
Professionalism of the inspectors. Risk analyses were conducted before the AI era. These often took place in the minds of professional inspectors and/or during work meetings. In other words: not only data, but also inspectors are an important source of knowledge about risks. Their knowledge is often implicit and based on years of experience. Application of AI can count on resistance from professionals. Not only that: too aggressive application of AI can come at the expense of their valuable knowledge.
Data pollution. Too much risk-based supervision can lead to data pollution: data mainly comes in from those under supervision who have previously been identified as being high-risk. Other people under supervision can thus remain out of sight. They can change their behaviour. There will therefore always be a demand for risk-based random supervision, in which random samples are also used for supervision. Within an organization there are different ideas about the right ratio.
Ethical issues. There is a lot of discussion about bias, protection of vulnerable individuals, transparency and privacy. Of course, these discussions also exist internally. This means that those involved – data scientists, inspectors, managers – make trade-offs between values. Many decisions about data and algorithms can be leading for the outcomes. These decisions increasingly seem to be made 'at the front', the data experts. This presents challenges with regard to the management of the data experts.

Based on these signals, we conclude that further development of AI has both technical and organizational dimensions. Successful development and implementation of AI will therefore have to be linked to the organization of supervisory practices.

How are technical development of AI and the supervisory organization connected and how can this connection be improved? Much literature on AI focuses on technical possibilities, while other literature deals with ethical concerns. Far less literature discusses the actual implementation and use of AI in organizational practice. A study into this subject should have two characteristics:
The research is interdisciplinary. It has both innovative-technical aspects and social-scientific aspects. The question is about the interplay between the two.
Connected to practice. We are looking for the application of AI in the context of practice. That is why we want to conduct empirical research, using one or more cases. The research will be carried out in close collaboration with the Dutch Food and Product Safety Authority (NVWA).
Requirements
In this project you will study and develop arrangements that bring together the world of AI and managements of surveillance.

This requires understanding of AI (data science, machine learning, programming) and more intangible processes of organization, including organization structures, informal coordination and organizational politics. It includes both analysis and design efforts. It will involve conducting case studies at NVWA

We are looking for someone who:
has a Master's degree and a background in policy analysis, public administration or a related field
has affinity (and preferably also demonstratable experience) with AI
has affinity (and preferably also experience) with organizational science
has the ability and interest to cross disciplinary boundaries
is fluent in English, both written and orally
has pro-active communication skills and is able to work well in a team

Doing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and a final thesis. For more details please check the Graduate Schools Admission Requirements.

Since the project is developed in close cooperation with a Dutch inspection agency (NVWA) that mostly communicates in Dutch, a candidate that speaks Dutch or is willing to learn the Dutch language is preferred.
Conditions of employment
Doctoral candidates will be offered a 4-year period of employment in principle, but in the form of 2 employment contracts. An initial 1,5 year contract with an official go/no go progress assessment within 15 months. Followed by an additional contract for the remaining 2,5 years assuming everything goes well and performance requirements are met.

Do you want to contribute to a vision on how to address new sensing capabilities of 21st century digital infrastructures in data governance law? And do you want to study one of the core legal and governance questions with respect to quantum technologies?

This PhD position on (Quantum) Data Governance and the Law of Sensing and Measurement is part of the new research group on the law and governance of quantum technologies at the Institute for Information Law, University of Amsterdam. The Institute for Information Law is one of the largest research facilities in information law world-wide.

What are you going to do

Over the last years, public and private investment in quantum technologies, including quantum computing, communications and sensing, have received a significant boost. Quantum computing has been the most eye catching in the quantum tech innovation landscape. It promises, when fully realized, to add additional special-purpose computational capacity to our current-day digital infrastructure. The advancement of quantum sensing technologies has proceeded with less fanfare, despite more advanced technology-readiness and wide possible application areas. Quantum sensing technologies promise to enhance digital infrastructures in ways that may have significant societal implications.

Measurement and sensing, including the establishment of standards and the collection of digital data in socio-technical settings, is a core function of current-day digital infrastructures. Through sensing, digital infrastructure facilitates processes of capture. This can be capture of operations, of behavior, and of environments, each creating new possibilities for control and governance in the process. Innovations in quantum sensing technologies may reconfigure such possibilities of capture in new ways.

Taking the increasing entanglement of law and digital infrastructure as a starting point, this PhD project will engage with the following questions. What are some of the unique legal challenges that quantum sensing applications may create in light of current information law, fundamental rights (including the right to private life and data protection)? Do some of the unique properties of quantum information (such as the possibility of entanglement and no cloning) and particular quantum sensing and metrology applications call into question the relation of law to information and data, as it has developed over the last decades? How can law support the beneficial and responsible use of quantum sensing applications while addressing such legal challenges? What challenges do disruptive sensing technologies pose for the law-infrastructure relationship? And finally, how should law respond to the dual-use nature of certain quantum sensing applications and contribute to the proper balance between the different societal interests implicated by quantum sensing technologies?

The PhD project will be part of the research group on the Law and Governance of Quantum Technologies at the Institute for Information Law (IViR) at the Faculty of Law of the University of Amsterdam. You will conduct original cutting-edge research into the law and governance of quantum technologies, quantum sensing technologies in particular. You will develop new insights into the specific legal implications of particular quantum sensing applications. And using legal theory, information law and other relevant disciplines, and while engaging with relevant stakeholders, you will contribute to our understanding of the relation between law and digital infrastructures today and in the quantum age.

What do we require

a completed degree in law, or equivalent degree;
affinity with questions of data governance and a knowledgeable curiosity for developments in quantum technologies;
good knowledge of current regulatory developments with respect to digital infrastructure and cloud computing;
excellent academic credentials, as demonstrated by grades and/or curriculum vitae;

Quantum computing has been the most eye catching in the broader quantum tech innovation landscape. It promises, when fully realized, to add additional special-purpose computational capacity to our current-day digital infrastructure.

Pathways to realizing scaled-up quantum computing remain uncertain, but one thing that different scenarios have in common is the problem of how to govern access to such new powerful computing resources. When quantum computers become a reality, how can and should access to these new types of computational resources be structured, governed and regulated? How can the governance of access address the possible harmful use of quantum computing, while offering the widest possible access for beneficial uses?

Seen in a historical perspective, what governance frameworks for access to computing can be discerned, and how have such frameworks been informed by the potentialities, organization, and ownership of computational resources? How can the governance of access to computing account for the specific interests in access to computing by public actors, industry, civil society and scientific researchers? And what are the distributive consequences of different access mechanisms and regimes, and how equitable will they be?

In this PhD, which is part of the research group on the Law and Governance of Quantum Technologies at the Institute for Information Law (IViR) at the Faculty of Law of the University of Amsterdam, you will study these and related questions. You will conduct original, cutting-edge empirical, theoretical and interdisciplinary research relating to the law and governance of advanced computing, including quantum computing, high performance computing and so-called hyperscale cloud offerings. You will develop insights into the way in which law relates to the increasingly constitutive function of computing in our societies, through the perspective of access to computing. Using information law, fundamental rights law, law and political economy, technology governance studies, and other relevant approaches and disciplines, and while engaging with relevant stakeholders in the public and private sector, you will contribute to our understanding of the relation between law and computing today and in the quantum age.
