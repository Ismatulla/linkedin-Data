Reservoir Engineer,"The Role
Where you fit in
Gas flooding is a recovery process that is applied in many assets where Shell Upstream has significant interests. The purpose of the Global Gas Flood team is to support these assets in generating value for Shell by sharing best practices between different assets, providing expert advice, and developing and deploying technologies that increase the value of these assets. The Global Gas Flood team plays in role in Shells Energy Transition journey as it is involved in CO2 sequestration and subsurface Hydrogen storage projects.
As a Reservoir Engineer you will have an essential role with many different interfaces including operations in the assets, development teams, partner staff, and laboratory staff that executes experimental work to support technology development or collects essential data to support decisions.
The successful candidate will become part of team of highly motivated reservoir and process engineers, working a wide range of projects to create value for Shell. The Gas Flood portfolio in Shell has been steadily growing and will only become more important with the increased focus on CC(U)S and gas utilization.
What’s the role?
As a Reservoir Engineer, you are responsible to support overall performance of gas flooding projects in Shell Upstream portfolio. This could be either by providing guidance on best practice in field development strategies or deployment of specific technologies. Maturation and de-risking of technologies that potentially increase the value of the gas floods in the Shell portfolio involves identifying and assessing the risks and uncertainties associated with the implementation of such technologies, developing, and implementing modelling techniques and guidelines, and integrating with other disciplines like production engineering, process engineering and production chemistry. The maturation of these technologies will likely require lab tests, field trials and/or pilots.
This role will actively support the design and execution of such trials together with partners and may involve attachment to natural teams for sustained support. Furthermore, there is a significant laboratory programme associated with the development of the technologies. It is also expected to keep abreast of competitor, industry, and academic developments in gas flooding. As new methods/innovations appear, you will assess the opportunity for application in Shell’s portfolio and communicate it to teams.
Key accountabilities:
Support maturation of technology that improves the value of gas floods with Shell interests
Maintain high safety standards and working with a Goal Zero mindset
Support gas flooding development planning studies and projects
What we need from you
MSc or preferably PhD in Physics, Chemistry, Natural Sciences (including petroleum engineering, geophysics, geology or a related discipline) or equivalent
Reservoir engineering experience in research and operating assets or development
Experience with gas flooding, or at least other Improved Oil Recovery/ Enhanced Oil Recovery (IOR/EOR) projects is an advantage
Fundamental understanding of hydrocarbon recovery processes
Knowledge and experience in reservoir simulation, recovery mechanisms and demonstrated abilities in physics/modelling/experimentation
Understanding of PVT/phase behavior, the interaction of phase behavior and flow and associated rock/fluid interactions
Good understanding of the role of reservoir engineering technology and its integration with all other subsurface and surface disciplines
Commitment to Goal Zero and ability to drive improvements in safety culture
Organizational skills to support optimal technology deployment, often in difficult circumstances with multiple interests and stakeholders to be managed
Inter-personal and team skills. Experience working in a multi-discipline and/or multi-cultural team would be advantageous
The role requires some flexibility to travel, depending on business needs
