Do you want to study one of the core legal questions in emerging quantum technology value chains? And do you want to contribute to a vision on how the law can support equitable development of quantum technologies?

This PhD position on Law and Innovation in Quantum Technologies is part of the new research group on the law and governance of quantum technologies at the Institute for Information Law, University of Amsterdam. The Institute for Information Law is one of the largest research facilities in information law world-wide. The Institute brings together more than 40 researchers from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds. The research group is a part of Action line 4 on the Ethical, Legal And Societal Aspects of Quantum Technologies of the Quantum Delta NL ecosystem.

What are you going to do

Intellectual property in the broad sense plays a vital role in advanced technology industries. Over the last years, public and private investment in quantum technologies, including quantum computing, communications and sensing, have received a significant boost. Innovation and development of quantum technologies is giving rise to specific questions of law and global value chains. Private sector quantum innovation strategies rely on strong protection through patents, trade secrets and other (quasi) intellectual property. This raises questions in relation to competition and equitable access to advanced quantum technologies across different stakeholders and internationally. National science and technology policies attempt to support thriving national and transnational quantum technology ecosystems, seeking protection for knowledge and skilled personnel. Concentrations of private power and geo-political competition around quantum technology development may lead a world of quantum haves and have-nots, increasing global inequalities. Early initiatives relating to quantum technologies at the international level include calls for responsible tech development, and recognition of human rights guarantees and Sustainable Development Goals.

Building on insights from the work on Law and Global Value Chains (GVCs), this PhD will engage with the following questions. What role do law and legal practice in the area of law and innovation (intellectual property, including trade secrets, contract law) play in emergent quantum technology ecosystems? What alternative arrangements are or can be imagined in relation to quantum technology intellectual property portfolio’s, in particular to further equitable development, open innovation and access to quantum technologies? How does law support different positions and strategies of relevant actors, and how do other governance tools, such as standardization, help relevant actors address tensions between security and other interests? How might a clash between open quantum innovation and securitization of quantum technology production be resolved, also in light of a new European imperative of strategic autonomy?

The PhD project will be part of the research group on the Law and Governance of Quantum Technologies at the Institute for Information Law (IViR) at the Faculty of Law of the University of Amsterdam. You will conduct original cutting-edge research into the law and governance of quantum technologies with a focus on emerging legal practices relating to quantum technology development. You will develop insights into the way in which law relates to the increasingly constitutive function of digital infrastructure in our societies, by conducting different case studies in the area of quantum computing, communications and sensing. Using relevant theory, information law and fundamental rights law, technology governance studies, and empirical methods, you will contribute to our understanding of law and quantum technology ecosystems in Europe and internationally.

What do we require

a completed degree in law, or equivalent degree;
affinity with questions of intellectual property and private law a knowledgeable curiosity for developments in quantum technologies;
knowledge of current legal developments with respect to technology and innovation;
excellent academic credentials, as demonstrated by grades and/or curriculum vitae;

Do you want to contribute to a vision on how to address new sensing capabilities of 21st century digital infrastructures in data governance law? And do you want to study one of the core legal and governance questions with respect to quantum technologies?

This PhD position on (Quantum) Data Governance and the Law of Sensing and Measurement is part of the new research group on the law and governance of quantum technologies at the Institute for Information Law, University of Amsterdam.

What are you going to do

Over the last years, public and private investment in quantum technologies, including quantum computing, communications and sensing, have received a significant boost. Quantum computing has been the most eye catching in the quantum tech innovation landscape. It promises, when fully realized, to add additional special-purpose computational capacity to our current-day digital infrastructure. The advancement of quantum sensing technologies has proceeded with less fanfare, despite more advanced technology-readiness and wide possible application areas. Quantum sensing technologies promise to enhance digital infrastructures in ways that may have significant societal implications.

Measurement and sensing, including the establishment of standards and the collection of digital data in socio-technical settings, is a core function of current-day digital infrastructures. Through sensing, digital infrastructure facilitates processes of capture. This can be capture of operations, of behavior, and of environments, each creating new possibilities for control and governance in the process. Innovations in quantum sensing technologies may reconfigure such possibilities of capture in new ways.

Taking the increasing entanglement of law and digital infrastructure as a starting point, this PhD project will engage with the following questions. What are some of the unique legal challenges that quantum sensing applications may create in light of current information law, fundamental rights (including the right to private life and data protection)? Do some of the unique properties of quantum information (such as the possibility of entanglement and no cloning) and particular quantum sensing and metrology applications call into question the relation of law to information and data, as it has developed over the last decades? How can law support the beneficial and responsible use of quantum sensing applications while addressing such legal challenges? What challenges do disruptive sensing technologies pose for the law-infrastructure relationship? And finally, how should law respond to the dual-use nature of certain quantum sensing applications and contribute to the proper balance between the different societal interests implicated by quantum sensing technologies?

The PhD project will be part of the research group on the Law and Governance of Quantum Technologies at the Institute for Information Law (IViR) at the Faculty of Law of the University of Amsterdam. You will conduct original cutting-edge research into the law and governance of quantum technologies, quantum sensing technologies in particular. You will develop new insights into the specific legal implications of particular quantum sensing applications. And using legal theory, information law and other relevant disciplines, and while engaging with relevant stakeholders, you will contribute to our understanding of the relation between law and digital infrastructures today and in the quantum age.

What do we require

a completed degree in law, or equivalent degree;
affinity with questions of data governance and a knowledgeable curiosity for developments in quantum technologies;
good knowledge of current regulatory developments with respect to digital infrastructure and cloud computing;
excellent academic credentials, as demonstrated by grades and/or curriculum vitae;
a creative mind and strong critical and analytical skills;
an interest in working across legal disciplines, using different methods (including empirical, theoretical and interdisciplinary), and collaborations with other relevant non-legal disciplines;

The Faculty of Law, Institute for Information Law (IViR), and the University Research Priority Area on Trust in the Digital Society (TRUST RPA: https://www.ivir.nl/trust-in-the-digital-society-new-uva-research-priority-area/ ) is looking for a postdoctoral researcher to study the institutional safeguards of trustworthy centralized and decentralized techno-social infrastructures.

The TRUST RPA is a five year long interdisciplinary research initiative to study how we trust is changing due to the emergence of new trust production technologies, and the disruption of existing trust relations.

The digital society relies on an ever-expanding network of digital infrastructures. This forces us to rethink some of our basic assumptions about one of the most fundamental resources in all interpersonal, social, economic relations: trust.
Despite their widespread use, we know little about the trustworthiness of our digital infrastructures. At best it is difficult to establish their trustworthiness (such as with AI), at worst they are proven to be untrustworthy (as is the case with social media).
Some of these digital infrastructures play key roles in interpersonal and societal trust dynamics. They disrupt existing trust relations and offer new ways to trust each other.
Our scientific methods and theories face serious limits when it comes to the study of change of social structures, institutions, and processes under the conditions of rapid technological transformation. Research on trust in technology and trust by technology is siloed, and focuses on narrowly defined technologies (AI), or problems (system security), and lacks a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, long-term-view.

This postdoctoral position (embedded in the TRUST RPA, supervised by both the Institute for Information Law, at the Amsterdam Law School, and at least one other participating faculty) will use empirical research to study how various new technological infrastructures disrupt or can enhance existing societal (impersonal, institutional) trust relations and strive to establish new forms of trust relations in society.

What are you going to do?

 The successful candidate will:
Conduct empirical, qualitative research (interviews, case studies, discourse analysis) on the dynamics of institutional, impersonal trust with regards to emerging digital technologies, such as digital platforms, web3 technologies, or Machine Learning based automated systems.
Coordinate the development, fieldwork and initial analysis of a large-scale longitudinal survey
Conduct work on the emerging European technology regulation framework (Digital Services Act, AI Act, Digital Markets Act) using doctrinal research, normative research and discourse analysis
Organize events, conferences
Participate in grant proposal development, international network building
Acquiree funding

The Postdoctoral researcher will be hired by the Faculty of Law, closely collaborating with two other postdoctoral researchers in the Trust RPA. The team will be supervised by the PIs of the TRUS RPA: Balazs Bodo, Associate Professor at the Institute of Information Law (IViR) at the Faculty of Law, Jan B. Engelmann, Professor of Neuroeconomics at the Amsterdam School of Economics, Theo Araujo, Associate Professor Communication in the Digital Society at the Amsterdam School of Communication Research (ASCoR), Tom van Engers, Professor in Legal Knowledge Management at the University of Amsterdam, and Marc Tuters, Assistant Professor in the New Media and Digital Culture Division of Media Studies at the Faculty of Humanities.

What do we require of you?

 The successful candidate has:
a PhD degree in law, or social sciences (sociology, economics, political science, communication science, science and technology studies or related fields)
strong empirical research skills;
familiarity with qualitative research methods,
familiarity with doctrinal research or policy research;
good knowledge of current developments in information markets and technology;
academic excellence, as shown in the grade transcripts and curriculum vitae.
a creative mind and analytical intelligence;
an interest in working in a multidisciplinary team;
willingness to learn new knowledge, and acquire new skills required by the project;
excellent written and spoken command of English, and ideally knowledge of Dutch
interest in working on interdisciplinary topics, in interdisciplinary teams.

Candidates, who have:
quantitative skills, including survey development, statistical analysis, and/or
familiarity with R, python or any other programming language, and/or
big data collection and analysis skills, and/or
previous experience in the private or public sector

will be given extra consideration in the application process.

We strongly encourage members of broadly understood minority socio-cultural groups to apply. We believe that there are several traditionally underrepresented, but incredibly forceful perspectives, that have transformed our respective disciplines. Recent scholarship by persons of colour, feminist, intersectionalist scholars, scholars from the Global South have highlighted fundamental issues with the design, operation, and impact of techno-social systems that remained in the blind spots of mainstream scholarship. Without such contributions, serious problems, such as racial bias in AI systems, would have gone unnoticed and left unaddressed by more careful technical design and better regulation.

Our offer

We offer a temporary employment contract for 38 hours per week for a period of 36 months with a probationary period of two months. The preferred starting date is as soon possible.
The gross monthly salary, based on 30,4 -38 (0.8-1 FTE) hours per week and dependent on relevant experience, ranges between € 2,960 to € 4,670 (scale 10). UvA additionally offers an extensive package of secondary benefits, including 8% holiday allowance and a year-end bonus of 8.3%. The UFO profile Researcher 4 is applicable. A favourable tax agreement, the ‘30% ruling’, may apply to non-Dutch applicants. The Collective Labour Agreement of Universities of the Netherlands is applicable.

Besides the salary and a vibrant and challenging environment we offer you multiple fringe benefits:
232 holiday hours per year (based on fulltime) and extra holidays between Christmas and 1 January;
Multiple courses to follow from our Teaching and Learning Centre;
Multiple courses on topics such as leadership for academic staff;
Multiple courses on topics such as time management, handling stress and an online learning platform with 100+ different courses;
7 weeks birth leave (partner leave) with 100% salary;
Partly paid parental leave;
The possibility to set up a workplace at home;
A pension at ABP for which UvA pays two third part of the contribution;
The possibility to follow courses to learn Dutch;

What else do we offer
the possibility to start up and grow a New Research priority Area at the UvA,
close working relations with five faculties of the UvA; and with TU Delft, and Erasmus University, Rotterdam
freedom to develop your own research agenda;
welcoming, international, dynamic teams;
an inspiring academic and professional environment in the heart of Amsterdam;
excellent possibilities for further professional development and education.

The GGSL organizes the education of Research Master students and PhD students in the Faculty of Law. The inspiring and stimulating research environment is evidenced by the last external research audit in 2017 that judged research of the faculty of outstanding quality and praised the GGSL for the way in which PhD students are supported and supervised from the start till the very end of the PhD.

THERESA project - HORIZON TMA MSCA DOCTORAL NETWORKS
THERESA is a project that integrates a consortium of universities made up of the Universitat Rovira i Virgili in Spain (coordinator), the University of Groningen in the Netherlands and the Eastern University of Finland. The three universities stand out for having Research Centres in the field of energy, environmental and sustainability law with a proven track record in these areas. Thanks to the long-standing collaboration between the three universities, THERESA DN proposes the first European doctoral programme for legal specialists in the field of the hydrogen economy. In the context of climate emergency and the socio-ecological transition of the Anthropocene, Green hydrogen is a promising energy carrier to facilitate the transition to an energy system based on renewable energies. Hydrogen can replace natural gas as a feedstock and help fossil-based economic sectors for which electrification is not possible, or excessively burdensome, to lower their greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, the development of a hydrogen market is characterized by uncertainties and associated economic, societal and environmental risks. The few existing scholarly legal studies on this subject matter highlight the fragmentation of the regulatory framework applying to hydrogen. THERESA combines the focus on three specific themes of regulatory intervention in the hydrogen economy – 1) reducing sectoral fragmentation to spur socio-environmental sustainability; 2) enabling sustainable circular use of hydrogen; and 3) societal engagement in the hydrogen economy – with three methodological approaches – doctrinal constructivism, empirical legal research and legal comparativism – to advance legal knowledge and form the doctoral experts needed to contribute to the development of a hydrogen economy. THERESA encompasses a fully-fledged training programme offering substantive, theoretical, methodological, and transferable skills to Doctoral Candidates.

The findings of the other (PhD) researchers involved in this project are relevant for the legal research and, vice versa, the PhD candidate will need to explain intermediate results to the other researchers on a continuous basis.

The two PhD candidates hired under the leadership of the University of Groningen concerns the following aspects:

Project description:

1. Individual research project: “Citizen Empowerment in the Hydrogen Economy”

As part of the energy transition towards a low-carbon society, the shift to the production and use of hydrogen as an alternative to natural gas is simultaneously a technological, economic and social challenge. While the societal dimension of the energy transition recently gained attention in political and scientific debates, societal implications remain understudied for the specific case of hydrogen as discussion mainly focuses on the market. One of the core topics of the societal dimension of the energy transition in general, and thus also of the production and use of hydrogen, is the involvement of citizens. In order to explore governance structures which facilitate the participation of citizens in the development, production and use of hydrogen, this project focuses on two main dimensions of citizen empowerment. First, citizen empowerment can take place by means of procedural participation, i.e. public participation in decision-making. In this context, the project aims at unveiling what participatory frameworks best fit public preferences about partaking in decision-making in the hydrogen transition. While legal frameworks in the European Union have a common denominator formed by the Aarhus Convention 1998, national practices might differ. In this context, this project will combine the legal comparison of frameworks and practices in selected EU Member States with longitudinal studies on public preferences. The combination of these methods proves well suited to reveal synergies and mismatches between what the law prescribes and what people prefer. This will allow proposing strategies to enhance synergies and bypass mismatches to facilitate the societal dimension of the hydrogen transition. Second, citizen empowerment can take place by means of (joint) ownership and/or financial participation, for example via energy communities. Energy communities are conceptualised as a promising way to facilitate procedural and distributive justice in the energy sector. Fulfilling this potential, the legal framework needs to specify the governance, the activities, and the purpose of energy communities. So far, the focus of this exercise has been on the case of energy communities in the electricity sector. While this provides a basis for understanding the potential of energy communities for the empowerment of citizens in the energy sector from a legal perspective, it is further necessary to explore whether and how the concept of energy communities can be applied to the case of hydrogen projects. Existing research on legal frameworks for energy communities and real-life cases of energy communities can provide an overview of legal options and obstacles of citizen empowerment via energy communities. This overview can inform the design of a legal framework for energy communities in the context of the hydrogen transition. Together, the insights generated from this project will help foster scientific knowledge on citizen engagement and guide practitioners, civil servants and market players, working on the hydrogen transition.

2. Individual research project: “Hydrogen for a Sustainable Mobility”

The transport sector represents a quarter of Europe's total Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and the international maritime sector is not even included in that count. `Greening` the transport sector is, hence, the next immediate frontier of EU policy– and `green´ hydrogen can play an essential role in this process, according to the EU Hydrogen Strategy and the `Fit for 55´-package, which are both part of the ‘European Green Deal’. The EU Hydrogen Strategy foresees the usage of ‘green’ hydrogen as a fuel primarily in the context of powertrains in heavy-duty vehicles, such as trucks, buses, ships and aircrafts. These vehicles are difficult to run on electricity and hydrogen is seen as a short- to mid-term solution. This, in turn, also affects the need for the development of hydrogen fuelling infrastructure. Hydrogen refuelling stations will be needed for the uptake of hydrogen in road-traffic (which accounts for about 70% of GHG-emissions from the transport sector) to refuel hydrogen buses, trucks and (at smaller scale) cars. Besides the need for infrastructure, the fuels as such must change and `green´ hydrogen as a sustainable transport fuel is being promoted by (inter alia) the Fuel Quality Directive and the Directive on Alternative Fuels Infrastructure (DAFI), as well as recent initiatives of 2021 under the `Fit for 55`-package, which aim particularly at aircrafts and ships. These are the revision to the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Directive to ensure aircraft and ships have access to clean energy supply in major ports and airports and other initiatives like ReFuelAviation and FuelEUMaritime, which outline more broadly how `green´ hydrogen can play a key role in future aviation and shipping. The project, hence, focusses on the identification of legal barriers in three areas of the transport sector: aviation, fuelling stations and shipping, as most immediate possibilities for hydrogen application in the transport sector. It will evaluate current and future legal initiatives and make suggestions for how these splintered approaches and initiatives could be streamlined and made more efficient. Moreover, it will present recommendations on how these transport sector activities in hydrogen can be better coupled to the legislative frameworks of other sectors, mainly energy and buildings, to achieve deep legal system integration. Given that EU transport legislation only provides a framework for Member States, the project will then also assess the transposition of the EU`s legal framework with a view to hydrogen in transport in the three Member States with the highest total GHG-emissions from the transport sector (Germany, France and Italy), by replying to functional legal comparative methodology. The project appraises the individual national legal frameworks for their ability to support hydrogen use in aviation, fuelling stations and shipping. By means of qualitative empirical methodology, based on semi-structured interviews, stakeholders from different transport sectors in different countries will provide deeper insights about the experienced legal barriers and possible solutions. The result shall be a distillate of legal best practices for hydrogen use in the transport sector. Overall, the project will help overcome legal barriers to a better integration of `green´ hydrogen in the transport sector in three ways: first it will make suggestions for streamlining legal initiatives in the EU, second it will make suggestions for an improved deep legal system integration of legislation affecting hydrogen in the transport sector with legislation of other sectors of hydrogen-application and third, it will uncover national best practices for hydrogen use in the transport sector and make them more easily accessible.

Postdoc on legal aspects of an interoperable offshore electricity grid,"Societal Challenge
This project is Part of Horizon Europe-funded project InterOPERA. Europe wants to build around 450 GW of offshore wind by 2050. In the future, the cables to connect offshore wind farms will not only transmit electricity directly to shore. They will also serve as interconnectors between countries and transmit electricity between different wind farms. Large, cross-border high voltage direct current (HVDC) electricity systems are needed for this. These systems must be interoperable and mutually compatible. The €69 million project “InterOPERA” will define the future interoperability standards of the multi-terminal high voltage direct current (HVDC) grids in offshore electricity. The project unites more than 20 European partners to cover both the technical and economic challenges as well as the legal and regulatory challenges. The University of Groningen’s main contribution in the project lies with the legal and regulatory framework.

Within the project, a major task is the development of a multi-vendor cooperation framework. This cooperation framework should have a legal basis, which is to be developed in the project, supported by us. The cooperation framework has links to energy law, competition law (cooperation between competitors) as well as intellectual property law (to protect the technology and software developed by the different actors).

The Position
Your role in the project is to contribute to the development of the cooperation framework with your specific legal expertise and independent analysis. You are expected to take an active and independent role in the work of the project and contribute to the relevant project meetings. Moreover, you are expected to contribute to the dissemination and valorisation of this research, by (co)authoring publications on the outcomes, active contribution in conferences and stakeholder dissemination events, as well as by activities that increase the societal impact of the research done in this project.

This is a 0,8 FTE position with a duration of 3,5 years.

Organisation
The University of Groningen is a research university with a global outlook, deeply rooted in Groningen, City of Talent. Quality has had top priority for four hundred years, and with success: the University is currently in or around the top 100 on several influential ranking lists.

The Faculty of Law (https://www.rug.nl/rechten/) is building on a longstanding tradition of four centuries of quality legal research.

Do you want to contribute to a vision on how to govern access to computing? And do you want to study one of the core legal and governance questions with respect to quantum technologies?

This PhD position on the Governance of Access to (Quantum) Computing is part of the new research group on the law and governance of quantum technologies at the Institute for Information Law, University of Amsterdam. The Institute for Information Law is one of the largest research facilities in information law world-wide. The Institute brings together more than 40 researchers from a variety of disciplinary backgrounds. The research group is a part of Action line 4 on the Ethical, Legal And Societal Aspects of Quantum Technologies of the Quantum Delta NL ecosystem.

What are you going to do

Over the last years, public and private investment in quantum technologies, including quantum computing, communications and sensing, have received a significant boost. Quantum computing has been the most eye catching in the broader quantum tech innovation landscape. It promises, when fully realized, to add additional special-purpose computational capacity to our current-day digital infrastructure.

Pathways to realizing scaled-up quantum computing remain uncertain, but one thing that different scenarios have in common is the problem of how to govern access to such new powerful computing resources. When quantum computers become a reality, how can and should access to these new types of computational resources be structured, governed and regulated? How can the governance of access address the possible harmful use of quantum computing, while offering the widest possible access for beneficial uses?

Seen in a historical perspective, what governance frameworks for access to computing can be discerned, and how have such frameworks been informed by the potentialities, organization, and ownership of computational resources? How can the governance of access to computing account for the specific interests in access to computing by public actors, industry, civil society and scientific researchers? And what are the distributive consequences of different access mechanisms and regimes, and how equitable will they be?

In this PhD, which is part of the research group on the Law and Governance of Quantum Technologies at the Institute for Information Law (IViR) at the Faculty of Law of the University of Amsterdam, you will study these and related questions. You will conduct original, cutting-edge empirical, theoretical and interdisciplinary research relating to the law and governance of advanced computing, including quantum computing, high performance computing and so-called hyperscale cloud offerings. You will develop insights into the way in which law relates to the increasingly constitutive function of computing in our societies, through the perspective of access to computing. Using information law, fundamental rights law, law and political economy, technology governance studies, and other relevant approaches and disciplines, and while engaging with relevant stakeholders in the public and private sector, you will contribute to our understanding of the relation between law and computing today and in the quantum age.

What do we require

a completed degree in law, technology governance, or equivalent degree;
affinity with the law and governance of computing and knowledgeable curiosity for developments in quantum technologies;
good knowledge of current regulatory developments with respect to the digital infrastructure and cloud computing;
excellent academic credentials, as demonstrated by grades and/or curriculum vitae;
a creative mind and strong critical and analytical skills;
an interest in working across legal disciplines, using different methods, and collaborations with other relevant non-legal disciplines;
strong communication skills and a dedication to contributing to diverse and inclusive team dynamics;
excellent language skills in English and one or more other languages;
