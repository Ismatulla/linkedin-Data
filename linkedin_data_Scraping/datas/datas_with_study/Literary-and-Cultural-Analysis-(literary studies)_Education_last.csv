The Faculty of Humanities, Leiden Institute for Area Studies (LIAS) is looking for a postdoctoral researcher to focus on the influence of the Purāṇas on the literary and material cultures of Southeast Asia for the ERC Advanced Grant project “PURANA – Mythical Discourse and Religious Agency in the Puranic Ecumene” (grant number 101054849).
Project Description
The Purāṇas constitute the most voluminous and enduring genre of Sanskrit literature. While many important Purāṇas were first recorded and circulated in the first millennium CE, the genre has remained a living tradition through the colonial period until the present day. Despite the tradition’s centrality for cultural production in South Asia, we know very little about their historical embeddedness. PURANA makes a critical intervention in the field by tracing the composition, transmission, translation, and agency of the Purāṇas as a transregional and transhistorical process involving multiple actors, audiences, and geographic contexts. Adopting a longue durée perspective, we argue that the Purāṇas’ mythical discourse underlies and unites the religio-political culture of the Sanskrit Cosmopolis—establishing what we call a ‘Puranic Ecumene’: a vast part of the inhabited premodern world united by a distinctive mythical discourse, a hegemonic vision of the integration of society and cosmos, and a remarkable way of anchoring the present in the continuing ancient past.
Key Responsibilities
The postdoctoral researcher will carry out research on the reception and re-creation of Indic Puranic narratives in Southeast Asian literary and material culture. While the Old Javanese Brahmāṇḍapurāṇa appears to be a unique case of direct translation of a known Sanskrit Purāṇa into Old Javanese, court poetry (Kakawin) in general attests to the massive impact of the Purāṇas on Javanese religion and society. Reception of Puranic narratives is also attested in epigraphic sources, temple arts, and iconographic programmes. The ideal candidate would make use of the large collection of Old Javanese manuscripts and Southeast Asian archival materials in the Leiden University Library special collections and the museums of the Netherlands. In addition to doing research, the candidate will have the opportunity to teach within the LIAS.
Selection Criteria
PhD in a relevant field (South and Southeast Asian Studies, Religious Studies, Art History).
Prior experience in conducting historical research with primary literary and/or material sources.
Excellent command of English as well as command of a relevant Southeast Asian language. Reading knowledge of Sanskrit is preferred as well.
Interested in working collaboratively with a multidisciplinary team exploring primary sources and their broader socio-historical contexts.

The Faculty of Humanities at Leiden University invites applications for a fulltime PhD position in Buddhist Studies. The PhD candidate will carry out research in the framework of the European Research Council (ERC) funded project ""Locating Literature, Lived Religion, and Lives in the Himalayas: The Van Manen Collection"" led by dr. Berthe Jansen. This project offers a study of an important collection of Himalayan texts and artifacts collected between 1920 and 1940 in Kalimpong and Tibet. It aims to provide a view of the Van Manen collection through a study of its rare manuscripts, the material objects, undocumented marginal writings, and the unique Tibetan language autobiographies by ordinary Himalayan people commissioned by Van Manen.

The project's goal is the examination of the van Manen Collection as a whole using historical, ethnographic and philological methods, and by employing Digital Humanities methods through which the origins of the texts and artifacts can be traced, mapped, and be made available, linking them to other editions in online databases as well as to local Tibetan archives. The main aim is to get an understanding of the proliferation, usage, and presence of religious and ritual literature and artifacts in the greater Darjeeling area in the first half of the 20th century and, by extension, their religious milieus.
The PhD candidate will work mainly with the rare and unusual Tibetan language manuscripts in the collection. S/he will make an inventory of the manuscripts that are either rare or unique and try to trace the geographical and textual origins of these manuscripts with the help of the PI. This will be done through 1) an examination of the ephemera that discuss the methods Van Manen’s assistants used to collect manuscripts 2) fieldwork: interviewing households that still own similar manuscripts in the greater Kalimpong area to retrieve information on the context of these ritual texts, and 3) locating similar manuscripts in existing databases such as that of the BDRC. Under the guidance of the PI, the PhD candidate will select particularly important Tibetan language texts, analyze, contextualize, and (as appropriate) translate them.

The PhD candidate will be based in Leiden where s/he will join a research team that will consist of four members: one PhD candidate, two post-doctoral researchers, and the project leader. S/he will participate in regular teammeetings and present his/her research findings at scholarly venues, as well as in field trips to India.
Requirements
An MA degree in Buddhist Studies, Tibetan Studies, Religious Studies or comparable. Candidates near completion of the degree will be considered
Excellent command of written Tibetan, both classical and modern
Fluency in spoken and written English
Broad knowledge of Tibetan religious and cultural history
Knowledge of (or willingness to learn) spoken Tibetan, Nepalese or Lepcha will be considered an asset
Some experience in working with Tibetan religious texts
Demonstrable interest in manuscript culture and literary production in culturally Tibetan regions
Willingness to work in an international research environment
Willingness to spend a limited amount of time teaching in the 2nd and 3rd year of the 4-year PhD trajectory
Willingness to help organize the yearly workshops
Ability to work independently and as part of and in support of a larger team

Professor of Contemporary Performing Arts,"University of Groningen
Since its foundation in 1614, the University of Groningen has established an international reputation as a dynamic and innovative university offering high quality teaching and research. Its 37,000 students are encouraged to develop their individual talents through challenging study and career paths. The University of Groningen is an international centre of knowledge: it belongs to the best research universities in Europe, and is allied with prestigious partner universities and networks worldwide. For additional information, see this link: https://www.rug.nl/about-ug/work-with-us/new-staff/. The University of Groningen has a strong commitment to the principles and practices of diversity and inclusion throughout the University community and welcomes candidates who enhance that diversity.

Faculty of Arts
The Faculty of Arts is building on a longstanding tradition of four centuries. Its mission is to be an ambitious top-ranking faculty in terms of both education and high-quality research, with a strong international orientation, firmly rooted in the North of the Netherlands. The faculty creates and shares knowledge through outstanding education and high-quality research, benefitting society.

Arts, Culture and Media
The ACM program is unique in the Netherlands with its doubly interdisciplinary structure: it combines a variety of theoretical and methodological perspectives with a broad range of art disciplines where students choose two art forms in their BA studies from music, theatre, film, literature or the visual arts. This rich interdisciplinary and inter-art setting calls for a scholar with openness to interdisciplinarity. Some of the overarching questions studied by the ACM staff are: How do we define the arts and what are their functions? Which roles do the arts play in the lives of individuals, for specific social groups and within society as a whole? How do related media impact the experiences and evaluation of the arts, and how do contemporary and newly emerging art forms relate to each other and the evolution and history of the arts? How have developments such as intermedial art, participatory art, digital art, performance art, sound art, or new media art transformed the arts in recent years? How do these new and emerging forms of arts deal with questions of climate disaster, post-colonialism, gender inequality? Related to this broad range of questions the new chair should also show commitment to thinking about historical changes in discussions about the arts and share a strong commitment to studying how the arts contribute to societal values and individual worldviews.

The Faculty of Arts in the University of Groningen invites applications for the position of Full Professor of Contemporary Performing Arts (Theatre/Music/Dance). This is a full-time and permanent post.

The successful candidate has an excellent, proven track record in the field of Contemporary Performing Arts, both in research and teaching, and has excellent leadership and mentorship qualities. The new professor comes with a rich and varied experience of working in multidisciplinary teams and is able to work in different fields. The chair holder is expected to lead a dynamic team of researchers with varied research interests and disciplinary backgrounds, and to promote and serve the long-term interests of the team and its members within the Faculty of Arts and beyond.

Research
The research task of the professor covers 40% of the appointment. Research in the field of Arts, Culture and Media (ACM) is housed in the Groningen Research Institute for the Study of Culture (ICOG) and, within this, in the Research Center for Arts in Society with theme groups such as ‘Music, Sound and Culture,’ ‘Film and Contemporary Audiovisual Media,’ and ‘Arts, Culture and Cognition.’ Furthermore, members of the Department of Arts, Culture and Media participate in various national research schools, such as the Research School for Media Studies (RMeS) or the Netherlands Institute of Cultural Analysis (NICA). The new chair will actively contribute to at least one of them. The new professor is expected to secure funding for research projects through research proposals in cooperation with academic or non-academic institutions within and outside the Netherlands. The candidate should therefore have experience in setting up national and international research programmes and obtaining funding. An extensive national and international network is essential.
The new chair will also actively seek PhDs students and explore new ways for joint or double degrees.

Teaching
Teaching covers 60% of the appointment (minus compensated management tasks), and the candidate is expected to teach and lead development of courses at all levels in the department. The ACM department provides education at the Bachelor level in the form of the international BA Arts, Culture and Media, the four minors and pre-master programmes, four MA tracks and two Research Master tracks. The new chair will be teaching in the BA program and in one or more of the four MA tracks in ‘Arts & Culture’: ‘Music, Theatre and Performance Studies’, ‘Arts, Cognition and Criticism’, ‘Arts, Policy and Cultural Entrepreneurship’, and ‘Film and Contemporary Audiovisual Media’, as well as the Research MA ‘Arts & Culture’ with its two tracks ‘Arts, Media and Literary Studies’ and ‘Cultural Leadership.’ Which courses the candidate will be teaching will depend on the profile of the candidate and needs of the program.

Management
The new professor leads the chair group Contemporary Performing Arts (Theatre/Music/Dance) and performs service and administrative tasks within and outside the Faculty of Arts. The new chair holder will play an active role in promoting the regional, national and international prestige of the chair group by initiating and contributing to existing societal and networking activities and will represent the chair group through their contacts with academic institutions and societal partners in the Netherlands and abroad.
