Interdisciplinary Assistant Professor (Tenure Track) “Happy and Healthy cities through sustainable food choices”,"Are you passionate about interdisciplinary research and exploring innovative ways to increase wellbeing and health in cities through sustainable food choices? Do you have a background in behavioural economics, urban/regional economics, environmental psychology, health economics, or economic geography? If yes, we have an exciting opportunity for you to join the Urban Economics Chair Group at Wageningen University.
In the Netherlands and most of the EU, more than 75% of people live in cities. Although cities are seen as powerhouses of our current economy in terms of creativity, innovation and economic productivity, they are also hotspots of unemployed, unhealthy and unhappy people. Inequalities in terms of opportunities to life and work, income and wellbeing are much larger than in the more rural regions across most of the western European territory. This is due to not only the composition of the population, but also the physical and social context they live in.
The leading question for this position is “What can we do to increase wellbeing and health in particular in cities, through healthy and sustainable food choices, in order to contribute to a fairer, more inclusive and sustainable society?”.
We intend to answer this question by connecting insights from multiple social disciplines, in particular economics and sociology, to go beyond standard indicators and quantitative methods.
Therefore, we are looking for someone who is a ‘boundary spanner’ and ‘methodologically flexible’ to connect economic, psychological, and sociological points of view. Both disciplines in Wageningen are interested in interdisciplinary collaboration through new experimental environments (for example living labs and digital visualization labs) and the use of the possibilities of data science and new data infrastructure. The integration of economic and sociological points of view will therefore start from new methodical approaches to understanding and influencing consumer choices. The value of different approaches will also be examined in different spatial environments, such as city and countryside.
Next to doing research, this position also involves teaching activities. These will be mainly in the field of wellbeing and health economics, as well as in interdisciplinary courses where you will give guest lectures. Furthermore, there might be opportunities to join methodological courses, i.e. on survey methods, choice experiments or field experiments, based on your experience.
Finally, with this position we intend to build partnerships within WUR, but also with social science chair groups outside WUR. Since it is financed by the Dutch ‘Sectorgelden’ you will be invited and encouraged to initiate and join activities with other chair groups (in particular economics, sociology and environmental psychology) at Dutch universities. Also, there will be opportunities to collaborate with the Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions (AMS) and the Dutch platform of food education (Voedselplatform)
The research is embedded within the Urban Economics Group which is led by Prof. Eveline van Leeuwen. You will also collaborate with other chair groups, such as Health and Society (HSO), Consumption and healthy lifestyles (CSO), Sociology of Development and Change (SDC), Agricultural economics and rural development (AEP) and Environmental and natural resources group (ENR).
Tenure Track is a career path for scientists who pursue to excel in education and research. We seek to attract scientific talent and to stimulate and support their development. Wageningen University & Research offers excellent terms of employment. A few highlights from our Collective Labour Agreement include:
sabbatical leave, study leave, and partially paid parental leave;
working hours that can be discussed and arranged so that they allow for the best possible work-life balance;
the option to accrue additional compensation / holiday hours by working more, up to 40 hours per week;
there is a strong focus on vitality and you can make use of the sports facilities available on campus for a small fee;
a fixed December bonus of 8.3%;
excellent pension scheme.
In addition to these first-rate employee benefits, you will be offered a fixed-term, 7 year contract which, upon positive evaluation based on criteria elaborated in the University's Tenure Track policy, can lead to a permanent employment contract as professor. Depending on your experience, we offer a competitive gross salary of between € 3974 and €6181 for a full-time working week of 38 hours in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreements for Dutch Universities (CAO-NU) (scale 11 or 12). Additionally, a contract for 0,8 FTE can be discussed.

"PhD position 'The Economics, Sustainability and Resilience of Novel and High-tech food-supply chains'","Within the Business Economics group of Wageningen University (www.bec.wur.nl) a PhD position has become available, linking the economics, sustainability and resilience of crop production and food-supply chains with insights on novel food production systems. The broader framework of the position is within the 4TU project Redesign, which aims to develop a high-tech and data-driven agri-food system of the future. The PhD position will be jointly supervised together with the Operations Research and Logistic Group of Wageningen University.

The main focus of the research will be on the empirical analysis of (1) the sustainability and resilience of novel food-supply chains, and (2) the decision-making of food-value chain actors, i.e., how the design of the novel supply chain organization and the interactions of actors within, affect the implementation, sustainability and resilience of these food -supply chains.
The PhD project has a quantitative-analytical nature. Various techniques will be applied, such as qualitative and quantitative analysis of data, the analysis of decision-making and behavior using surveys and workshops, as well as the design of a sustainable supply-chain game. The aim is to supply relevant information for the design of novel, sustainable and resilient food-supply chains. Hence, translation of research findings to other disciplines and working together with food-supply chain stakeholders also is an important aspect of the work.
Activities include:
Providing an overview on the economics, resilience and sustainability of novel food-supply chains;
Empirically assessing and comparing the sustainability and resilience of novel food-supply chains;
Eliciting and analyzing decisions of supply-chain actors;
Design and testing of a sustainable supply-chain game with different food supply-chain actors.
An openness for other disciplines is important and collaborations with researchers and research groups within the 4TU Redesign project will be facilitated. Relevant courses to overcome possible knowledge/skill gaps will be provided.

PhD in Network Statistics and Machine Learning,"PhD in Network Statistics and Machine Learning
Faculteit/Dienst: Faculteit Economie & Bedrijfskunde
Opleidingsniveau: Master
Functie type: Wetenschappelijk Personeel
Sluitingsdatum: 1 May 2023
Vacaturenummer: 11265
Are you interested in studying networks and using methodology at the cross-section of business analytics, econometrics and computer science? The Business Analytics section at the University of Amsterdam Business School invites applications for a PhD position in Network Statistics and Machine Learning. We are looking for candidates with the ambition to work and succeed at the highest international academic level.

The main topic of research is network analysis and modelling using statistical and machine learning tools. Network data are ubiquitous in finance, social media, the economy, and business. Social networks play an increasingly important role in society. For example, the Reddit community WallStreetBets hyped the stock of GameStop (GME), causing a short squeeze and extremely volatile stock prices in early 2021. Similarly, statements made on social networks such as Twitter have been shown to impact public and voter opinions. Exemplifying how social networks directly affect the economy, this project focusses on studying network data with a specific interest in modelling and understanding how networks change over time. Change detection in an online fashion is a challenging task in networks of large size, a common property of social networks.

In this research, the candidate will first investigate and develop interpretable network analysis approaches using statistical models and test them on real-life data. Then geometric deep learning approaches for the tasks like node classification, link prediction and graph classification will be developed with change detection ability. In the final phase of the project, the candidate should bring together two families of methods and design an optimized algorithm that is both interpretable and yields a high performance in network change detection.

The PhD student will work in close collaboration with the supervisory team and other faculty on the tasks.
The supervisory team will consist of dr. Inez Zwetsloot (ABS), dr. Simon Trimborn (ASE) and dr. Stevan Rudinac (ABS).

What are you going to do?

Develop novel interpretable statistical models for network analysis;
develop novel deep-learning approaches for node classification, link prediction, and community detection in network data;
create open data and software tools for the envisioned network analysis tasks;
present research findings at international conferences;
write up findings for publication in international journals;
pursue and complete a PhD thesis within the appointed duration of four years;
attend classes and seminars (including those offered at other universities) to develop thinking and research skills further;
participate in and contribute to departmental research functions (PhD Day, research seminars, and research meetings);
assist in knowledge dissemination activities;
participate in teaching-related activities (to a limited degree), including undergraduate tutorials and the supervision of MSc and/or BSc thesis projects.

What do we require?

Formal requirements:
Masters’ degree in Statistics, Econometrics, Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, Data Science, Mathematics, or a related field (expected to finish by September 2023)

Task-related requirements:
Excellent communication skills in English, both oral and written, ideally with experience writing for a scientific audience;
willingness and motivation to independently formulate research projects and carry them through to completion;
mathematical skills, data analytics skills, and a strong willingness to develop these skills further;
excellent programming skills in one or more of the following languages: Python, R, C, C++;
preferably experience with at least one of the following: network data analysis, deep learning libraries such as PyTorch or TensorFlow, timeseries modeling and prediction, high-performance computing.3

Additional requirements:
Preference is given to candidates with some research experience (e.g., Master thesis and/or research assistant experience);
strong commitment to methodological rigor and scientific integrity;
energy and passion for statistics and machine learning;
intellectual curiosity, eagerness to learn, and openness to criticism;
willingness to participate in disseminating research results and valorization.

Our offer

The employment contract will be for four years with an initial period of 18 months, with an intermediate evaluation after 18 months and a possibility to extend it for 30 months (in total, four years).
