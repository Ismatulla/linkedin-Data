Description
From afar, all planets are pale dots of various colors. Determining whether any one of these single pixels of light represents a living planet is a serious technical and theoretical challenge. We are doing research that will help address the theoretical challenges, by modeling the history of atmospheres of the terrestrial-sized planets in our solar system. This will give us a variety of planets against which to compare our future exoplanet observations, and versatile tools we can use to interpret those observations.

This opportunity presents multiple options to prospective postdocs to explore the potential for life on other planets, and to develop our capabilities to detect such life. We work with multiple atmospheric, oceanic, ecological, and instrument models to study the atmospheres, surface environments, and spectral features of terrestrial-sized planets. In the past, this has included research on ancient Earth, Mars, and extrasolar planets. In the future we will also apply these tools to Titan and Venus. We simulate each of these planets with 1-D and 3-D (GCM) models. 1-D modeling will self-consistently treat the photochemistry, climate, and spectroscopy of planets with a wide variety of parameters. 3-D modeling will utilize the ModelE GCM to focus on specific planets at specific points in their evolution. These studies are designed to better describe the habitability of these planets, and to utilize our knowledge of solar system history to improve future searches for life on extrasolar planets.

We are interested in self-sufficient applicants with the capacity for interdisciplinary research, a background in modeling, and a desire to apply these talents to questions that lie at the intersection of planetary atmospheres and astrobiology. Experience modeling the atmosphere of Earth or atmospheres of other planets is preferred. This opportunity draws on a broad range of atmospheric modeling techniques, parameters, and conditions. Thus, we will work with the prospective applicants to coordinate the proposed activities. Thus, if you are interested in applying to this opportunity, please contact the primary advisor (Shawn Domagal-Goldman) in advance to coordinate your proposed activities.

Description
Proposals are invited that focus on developing novel techniques and applications for measuring trace (ppm-levels or below) element abundances, partioning behaviors and isotopic compositions in planetary materials, analog samples and standard reference materials via solution preparation (e.g., column chromatography, isotope dilution and high-precision standard addition) and particularly in situ laser ablation (LA-) inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), as well as other complementary methods including laser ablation/desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS). The development of innovative analytical protocols and the quantitative determination of the chemical compositions of precious sample specimens, such as chondritic and achondritic meteorites and Mars analog samples, will be encouraged to explore (contemporary and ancient) surface and deep mantle processes associated with the differentiation of planetary bodies. Examples of potential research topics include: Development and testing of cutting-edge LA-ICP-MS and/or complementary laser desorption/ionization TOF-MS methods to measure ultratrace elements at ppb-levels or lower and/or isotopic compositions with high precision and accuracy; Cosmochemical analysis of planetary materials, including (but not limited to) stony and iron meteorites, Mars/Titan analog samples, and synthetically-derived interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) to support current flight projects and enhance our understanding of planetary processes associated with accretion and internal differentiation (e.g., magma ocean formation, core-mantle separation, and early silicate melting); Investigation into the geochemical behavior, sequestration and chemical systematics of ultratrace elements in ancient terrestrial rocks (e.g., Tonalite-Trondhjemite-Granodiorite, or TTGs, basaltic komatiites, and Archean zircons) to better understand the planet's thermal evolution, initiation of plate tectonics and role of oxygen fugacity during the formation of distinct mantle reservoirs; and, Expansion of analytical capabilities associated with radiogenic isotope geology and geochronology, particularly the development, demonstration and usage of in situ methods to analyze and date ancient geological materials.

Studies should take advantage of existing mass spectrometry and related laboratory facilities, including: 193 nm wavelength, 4 ns pulse-width excimer laser ablation system; high-resolution double-focusing ICP-MS; UV- and IR-laser TOF-MS prototypes; and, chemical fume hoods. Backgrounds in geology/chemistry/physics are preferred, and experience with ICP-MS operations, laser ablation/desorption processing, acid digestions and wet chemical procedures, development of new analytical methods, high vacuum systems, and general mass spectrometry knowledge is required.

Description
Research is centered on understanding and interpreting the geologic conditions of past aqueous environments on Earth, Mars, and meteorite parent bodies. We seek to answer questions regarding the temperatures, time scales, nature of water-rock interaction, and chemical characteristics of these ancient aqueous systems with the final goal of assessing their suitability for sustaining life. The approach to the problem encompasses analysis of data returned from planetary missions (such as MSL, Phoenix, and the MER rovers), geochemical analysis of samples, laboratory experiments, and field work. Sample analysis includes mineralogy and bulk chemistry with an emphasis on light stable isotope measurements. Laboratory experiments are used in conjunction with theoretical calculations to better understand complex systems where kinetic processes may be dominant. Field work has primarily focused on terrestrial analogs to planetary environments.
Our recent focus has been centered on Mars including analysis of data returned from the SAM instrument on the Curiosity rover, analysis of martian meteorites (e.g. ALH84001), laboratory experiments exploring the weathering of minerals in cryogenic environments, laboratory experiments on abiotic methane synthesis and oxidation, and field work at continental hot springs in Nevada and California.
Besides the other available analytical laboratories at JSC, our research primarily utilizes a gas source isotope ratio mass spectrometer (MAT 253) equipped with a gas bench and GC-C/TC-Pyroprobe allowing for stable isotope analysis of water, carbonates, gases, and any combustible material.

Description
Surface mineralogy and geochemistry of Mars are key to characterizing geological processes on ancient and modern Mars. Mineralogical and geochemical measurements from Mars show that the ancient surface was altered by liquid water. The types of minerals and geochemical trends observed on the surface can help determine the characteristics of these ancient aqueous environments and whether or not they would have been habitable to microbial life. The goal of this research is to reconstruct the history of liquid water on Mars through mineralogical and geochemical measurements of the martian surface and analog materials. These analog materials can be synthesized in the laboratory or collected from Mars analog sites on Earth. Studies of phyllosilicate, iron oxide, sulfate, and carbonate minerals and amorphous or poorly crystalline phases are encouraged. Studies of mineral sorting and segregation in fluviolacustrine and aeolian environments on Earth as a means to interpret the mineralogy of martian surface deposits are also of great interest.
Analytical instruments available at JSC include X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, thermal and evolved gas analysis, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy, ion chromatography, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and electron microprobe. JSC also has test bed instruments for the CheMin X-ray diffractometer on the Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover, the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument on Curiosity, the Thermal and Evolved Gas Analyzer (TEGA) on Phoenix, ChemCam on Curiosity, and the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and data collected on these instruments are directly comparable to those collected on Mars. Scientists with experience analyzing weathering products or amorphous materials using Synchrotron techniques are also encouraged to apply.

Description
Description:
The story of a planet’s evolution is written in the geochemical signatures of its crust. Earth’s primary crust and ancient history has been erased by active plate tectonics and eroded by wind and water. Differentiated planetary bodies without plate tectonics or atmospheres best preserve the geochemical evidence of ancient crust formation and evolution in addition to providing insight regarding the early Earth.
This research theme focuses on understanding the evolution of planetary crusts with perspective rooted in sample science (e.g., Apollo samples and lunar meteorites, martian meteorites, achondrites). My work then integrates experimental petrology, orbital mission data, and geophysical modeling to reconstruct the earliest history of planetary surfaces and their transition to secondary and tertiary crust building. Investigations are conducted within the Astromaterials Research & Exploration Science (ARES) Division at NASA Johnson Space Center, which is home to many microanalytical instruments in both the Coordinated Analysis Laboratory (including the JEOL 7900F SEM and JEOL 8530F electron microprobe) and the mass spectrometry laboratories in the Center for Isotope Cosmochemistry and Geochronology (including in situ trace element and isotopic analysis via LA-MC-ICPMS). The Experimental Petrology suite in ARES houses multiple Deltech 1-atm gas-mixing furnaces for conducting both isothermal and controlled cooling experiments at relevant planetary redox conditions.
Some example topics include planetary geothermometry, synthesis of planetary materials for reflectance spectroscopy studies with application to orbital remote sensing data, and constraining the processes involved during the initiation of secondary crust building on the Moon.
Prospective candidates with mutual interests in this research theme are encouraged to reach out and identify potential projects. Due to the integrative approach to this research, collaboration with other NPP principal investigators residing in ARES is also encouraged.
