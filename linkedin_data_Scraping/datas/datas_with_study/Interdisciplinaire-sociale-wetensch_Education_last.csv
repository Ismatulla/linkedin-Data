PhD researcher in Criminal Procedure Law and AI for intelligence analysis,"Location: AMSTERDAM

FTE: 1 - 1
Job description
Do you want to study one of the core legal and regulatory issues relating to the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for intelligence analysis in criminal investigations?

And do you want to contribute to a vision on how to regulate such AI through criminal procedure law and technology?


This PhD position on Criminal Procedure Law and AI for intelligence analysis at the Criminal Law group of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam is part of an interdisciplinary research project ‘AI4Intelligence’. You will join an exciting and vibrant community where legal scholars, computer scientists and public administration experts meet and form interdisciplinary teams that work at the intersection of Criminal Procedure Law and Technology.


Your duties

What are you going to do?
The main goal of using AI for intelligence analysis is to produce evidence that can be used in criminal cases in court. However, in order to translate AI-generated information into admissible court evidence it must comply with the general evidentiary requirements of reliability and lawfulness. There are two interrelated reasons that make satisfying these requirements difficult. First, there is a lack of (clear) rules as to how the evidentiary requirements – developed for analogue situations with different types of evidence in mind – are to be operationalised in the context of AI in the criminal process. And, second, AI diminishes the transparency and explainability of the evidence-creation process. The resulting effect reduces the possibility of the judge and the defence to question and contest AI-generated evidence (i.e., ‘contestability’). The end result is that neither the judge nor the defence can properly assess whether the content of the information is truthful and has been obtained through legal methods. The lack of contestability of AI-generated evidence therefore has a significant effect on one of the core rights and principles of the criminal process: the right to a fair trial and the accompanying principle of equality of arms.


Building on existing work on AI-regulation, due process and digital evidence, this PhD will engage with the following questions. What enables the contestability of AI-produced evidence in court? How could and should requirements of transparency and explainability (as stemming from the right to a fair criminal trial) be understood in the context of AI-generated evidence and its ‘black box’ nature? To what extent can the requirements of transparency and explainability be ‘hardcoded’ in AI-tools themselves? And can a ‘dialogue-based’ approach to explainability via symbolic-AI and interactive visualisation techniques, which allow for the inclusion of contextual knowledge, mitigate issues relating to the trouble with hardcoding complex legal rules?


The PhD is a part of an NWO-funded interdisciplinary research project (‘AI4Intelligence’), which enables close collaboration with the Department of Information and Computing Sciences and the School of Governance at Utrecht University, and the Visual Analytics group (Department of Mathematics and Computer Science) at Technical University Eindhoven. Through close collaboration with researchers in law, computer science, visual analytics and public administration, you will conduct cutting-edge interdisciplinary research into the regulation of AI for intelligence analysis. With your interdisciplinary collaborative work you will be able to translate research results into innovation and influence policymaking in the Netherlands.
Requirements
a completed master’s degree in law; knowledge of Dutch criminal law is a plus;
affinity with questions of criminal law and technology and a knowledgeable curiosity for AI;
excellent academic credentials, as demonstrated by grades and/or curriculum vitae;

PhDs for project about the causes and consequences of societal threat perceptions,"2 PhDs for project about the causes and consequences of societal threat perceptions
Faculteit/Dienst: Faculteit der Maatschappij- & Gedragswetenschappen
Opleidingsniveau: Master
Functie type: Promotieplaats
Sluitingsdatum: 17 April 2023
Vacaturenummer: 11360
We are looking for 2 PhD candidates to join a new research project lead by Dr. Bert N. Bakker (PI), supported by an NWO VIDI grant. The project is embedded in the Hot Politics Lab (an interdisciplinary research group focusing on political psychology) and the Amsterdam School of Communication Research at the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences.
This project starts with the observations that with a pandemic, the war in Ukriane, climate change, terrorist attacks, and financial meltdowns, we have in the last twenty years experienced multiple threats that potentially could have (or will in the future) fundamentally alter our way of life. Threats have adverse effects when they erode democratic stability by sparking violence and fuelling support for anti-democratic politics. However, threats might benefit society when they trigger desired behaviour, such as reducing the eco-footprint or getting a vaccination. Given the complex role of threat in society, it is crucial to understand better the processes underlying people's threat perceptions and develop strategies for mitigating the adverse effects and stimulating the beneficial effects of threat perceptions on democracy and society. This project bridges theories from communication science, psychology, and neuroscience by the overarching research question: How do people perceive and regulate threats and adopt political attitudes and behaviours to counter these threats.
In this project, we will be studying the explicit (self-reported) and implicit (psychophysiological) instantiations of threats and their interplay. To do this, the project will use an innovative mixed-methods design: in-depth interviews, cross-country surveys, survey experiments, and laboratory experiments, as well as intensive experience sampling studies that track threats over multiple days. The project description can be found here.

What are you going to do

The basic plans for the PhD projects are stated below. These will be adapted to the interest and expertise of the hired candidates.
PhD 1 focuses on the causes and consequences of societal threats. Research in political communication suggests elite cues cause people to see issues and events as threatening or not. Drawing upon appraisal theory (Scherer & Moors, 2019), one might expect that controllability and distance to the threat are causing threat perceptions. Step 1 in this project is to study the causes (elite cues, framing) that elicit perceptions of societal threats among citizens. In step 2, we will be exploring the causes of these societal threat perceptions to answer the question whether citizens adopt political attitudes and behaviours to counter the threat. The empirical approach of this project consists of survey-experiments, laboratory-based experiments using physiological measures (skin conductance, facial EMG) as well as eye-tracking, and computer-assisted content analysis.
PhD 2 focuses on the question to what extent citizens regulate societal threats, and to what extent does the regulation of threat condition the effects of threats on politics? In this project, we will be analysing the common threat regulation strategies in response to societal threats and their effect on political attitudes and behaviours to tackle the threat. In response to a threat, people could, for instance, engage in: cognitive reappraisal and reframe situations to change the emotional impact (e.g., climate change is threatening, but there is hope as climate change offers opportunities to recreate a better society); down-regulation and lower the intensity of the threat (about, for instance, climate change); or distraction and direct attention away from the threat (e.g., shifting attention from climate change to other (non-)political topics that are not threatening). PhD 2 will be exploring why, when and how people regulate societal and imagined threats and the consequences this has for the effects of threats on politics. The empirical approach consists of in-depth interviews, surveys, experience sampling (or diary) studies, and experiments.

Job description
The Department of Philosophy at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam has a vacancy for a PhD researcher on a project related to “Cooperation and Rationality”.


Possible projects: in many situations, agents often have reasons both for and against cooperating. What makes cooperation nevertheless successful? This question can be approached both descriptively and normatively. In the descriptive realm, empirical research has looked at investigating the factors that foster cooperation. In the normative domain, philosophical work has been dedicated to discussing various conceptions of rationality. We invite projects situated at the interface of these two fields, which raises questions such as: Which conception(s) of rationality are actually at work in empirical studies of cooperation? And which ones would be best suited for understanding cooperation?


The PhD project will be carried out in close collaboration with and will be supervised by dr. Jelle de Boer, dr. Lisa Bastian and prof. dr. Lieven Decock.


Your duties
conduct research on the topics of “Cooperation and Rationality”, resulting in a PhD dissertation and journal publications

participate in the VU PhD training program
Requirements
the candidate has a (preferably Research) Master degree in Philosophy or Economics/Behavioral Science, attained before September 1, 2023
the candidate has a Master degree or a Bachelor degree in Philosophy or in PPE
the candidate has affinity with analytic philosophy, decision/game theory, and empirical studies of cooperation (as shown in grade transcripts, final thesis, and curriculum vitae)
excellent spoken and written English as well as strong academic writing skills are essential
What are we offering?
A challenging position in a socially involved organization. The salary will be in accordance with university regulations for academic personnel and amounts € 2,541 (PhD) per month during the first year and increases to € 3,247 (PhD) per month during the fourth year, based on a full-time employment. The job profile is based on the university job ranking system and is vacant for at least 0.8 FTE.


The appointment will initially be for 1 year. After a satisfactory evaluation of the initial appointment, the contract will be extended for a total duration of 4 years (or 5 years in case of a 0.8 FTE contract).


Additionally, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam offers excellent fringe benefits and various schemes and regulations to promote a good work/life balance, such as:
a maximum of 41 days of annual leave based on full-time employment
8% holiday allowance and 8.3% end-of-year bonus

Junior researcher position Embodied teamwork of police officers,"Are you interested to find out how police officers can successfully collaborate under unpredictable, complex, and at times stressfull circumstances? And are you particularly interested in the role of embodiment in teamwork in action? Then this junior researcher position might be for you. Please apply at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.


Location: AMSTERDAM

FTE: 0.8
Job description
In the research project that the successful candidate will be working on we will analyse (already available) video recordings of collaboration between police officers in realistic training situations. The analysis will aim to integrate the cognitive and embodied views on teamwork and to test different methods for analysing teamwork of police officers. On the basis of the “big five” teamwork model (Salas et al., 2005) and the framework of joint action (e.g. Sebanz et al., 2006) we will develop a codebook and code the behaviors of police officers in the recorded training scenario’s. For each scenario we have data available on gender and experience of the police officers in the scenario, and measures for quality of collaboration, amount of trust in their colleague, and level of realism of the scenario (as perceived by the officers). After coding we will test different analysis methods to identify behavioral temporal patterns (i.e. patterns that represent teamwork) and identify strengths and weaknesses of these methods.
Requirements
 A master degree (or about to obtain one) in human movement sciences, psychology or a related field;
Keen interest in how humans collaborate under complex circumstances and the role embodiment plays;
Affinity with observational data;
Curiosity to experiment with different analysis methods to identify behavioral temporal patterns such as REM or T-pattern detection.
Interest to co-author scientific publications on the outcomes of these studies.
As verbal behavior will also be coded in this project, the candidate will need sufficient understanding of the Dutch language to be able to do so.
What are we offering?
A challenging position embedded in two institutes, the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (employer) and the Netherlands Institute for the Study of Crime and Law Enforcement (NSCR, where the data is obtained and stored).

How does a waiter at a restaurant know what we mean when we point to an empty glass, and how did we learn to select that particular gesture? As a research assistant, you will help organise a longitudinal study in pre-school children to help understand human communication and how it develops.

This project builds on the notion that social experiences early in life are crucial for the development of human communication skills. The project uses natural variability in early life social experiences as a tool to understand how different sociocultural environments guide the development of human communicative capacities. We plan to test long-lasting effects of those experiences on the human ability to communicate. The specific goal of the project is to identify which features of children's sociocultural environment influence their ability to coordinate with other people later in development. We are looking for a MSc interested in organising an ambitious real-life longitudinal study involving pre-school children. The study will use wearable audio-recording devices to measure the interactions of 3- to 4-year-old children during their time in day care (e.g. over the course of a week).

PhD Artificial intelligence for tracking the politics of climate change adaptation,"A highly motivated PhD student on the interface of artificial intelligence and climate action.

Keen to further develop artificial intelligence approaches to enhance climate action? Always wondered why governments are typically reluctant to track their implementation of climate action? Curious about the political dynamics that shape how governments around the globe are (not) adapting to climate change? Then this PhD project on using artificial intelligence methods for analyzing the politics of tracking climate change adaptation could be a great fit!


This PhD position is part of the NWO-VIDI project led by Dr. Robbert Biesbroek (Public Administration and Policy group) entitled “High ambitions, (s)low implementation? The politics of tracking adaptation to climate change (2023-2027).

Background of the program: Adapting to the impacts of climate change is necessary and increasingly urgent. Governments across the globe have increasingly formulated high adaptation ambitions to become more climate resilient. In order to understand if these ambitions are implemented in practice, tracking progress on adaptation is of critical importance. This program aims to develop, theorize and empirically test the causes and consequences of the politics of adaptation tracking. Adopting a comparative approach, the program investigates the political dynamics around the Global Stocktake under the UNFCCC Paris Agreement, the EU Climate Change Adaptation Strategy, and ongoing climate change adaptation developments in several countries from across the globe. In the program mixed methods are used, combining traditional methods of expert interviews, observations and focus group discussions, with machine learning and quantitative text analysis to analyze the politics of adaptation tracking.
The program takes a solutions-oriented perspective by co-designing politically sensitive intervention pathways with practitioners. It provides concrete evidence-based insights where and how to intervene in policy processes in order to accelerate the design and execution of adequate and effective frameworks on adaptation tracking.

There are two PhD positions in this NWO-VIDI program. The position in this call will focus on using Artificial Intelligence methods to track the politics of tracking climate change adaptation. The other PhD position will focus on conceptualizing and empirically investigating the politics of adaptation tracking using a primarily a qualitative approach.

For this PhD position “Artificial intelligence for tracking the politics of climate change adaptation”, you will:
Employ state-of-the art machine learning tools to develop evidence maps on what is already known about the politics of tracking policy for climate and other sustainability challenges
Develop and apply natural language processing methods to analyze the politics of tracking adaptation to climate change from a variety of sources (media, policy documents, minutes, speeches, etc.) at national and global levels
Co-organize and participate in workshops on the politics of adaptation tracking
Lead the development of 4 scientific publications which form the basis of your PhD dissertation. You will also be involved in developing program-level publications (as co-author)
Present your work at (inter)national scientific conferences and/or symposia
In addition to the other PhD candidate in this program, you will collaborate in Dr. Biesbroek’s research lab with ~10 other postdocs, PhD candidates, and research assistants working on climate change related topics. For this project you will also collaborate with Prof. Dr. Ioannis Athanasiadis (Professor of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, Wageningen University) who will act as the second promotor in this PhD project.
The selected candidate preferably starts June-August 2023. Wageningen University & Research offers excellent terms of employment. A few highlights from our Collective Labour Agreement include:
sabbatical leave, study leave, and partially paid parental leave;
working hours that can be discussed and arranged so that they allow for the best possible work-life balance;

there is a strong focus on vitality and you can make use of the sports facilities available on campus for a small fee;
a fixed December bonus of 8.3%;
excellent pension scheme.
In addition to these first-rate employee benefits, you will receive a fully funded PhD position and you will be offered a course program tailored to your needs and the research team.
The gross salary for the first year is € 2.541,- per month rising to € 3.247,- in the fourth year in according to the Collective Labour Agreements for Dutch Universities (CAO-NU) (scale P).

Developing organizational arrangements for artificial intelligence in public surveillance
Job description
We are looking for an enthusiastic PhD candidate with a background in the field of policy analysis, public administration, policy sciences or a related field to study and develop organizational implementation arrangements for Artificial Intelligence (AI) for regulatory surveillance. The position is a for 4-year PhD track, financed by the Faculty of Technology, Policy and Management, department of Multi-Actor Systems in close collaboration with regulatory agencies.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly used in regulatory processes. No wonder, AI promises a more effective regulatory supervision process, in which inspectors on the floor are advised on the basis of AI-generated risk analysis. Technically there are still many development possibilities. However, whether AI can be applied effectively and responsibly also raises organizational issues, such as:
Professionalism of the inspectors. Risk analyses were conducted before the AI era. These often took place in the minds of professional inspectors and/or during work meetings. In other words: not only data, but also inspectors are an important source of knowledge about risks. Their knowledge is often implicit and based on years of experience. Application of AI can count on resistance from professionals. Not only that: too aggressive application of AI can come at the expense of their valuable knowledge.
Data pollution. Too much risk-based supervision can lead to data pollution: data mainly comes in from those under supervision who have previously been identified as being high-risk. Other people under supervision can thus remain out of sight. They can change their behaviour. There will therefore always be a demand for risk-based random supervision, in which random samples are also used for supervision. Within an organization there are different ideas about the right ratio.
Ethical issues. There is a lot of discussion about bias, protection of vulnerable individuals, transparency and privacy. Of course, these discussions also exist internally. This means that those involved – data scientists, inspectors, managers – make trade-offs between values. Many decisions about data and algorithms can be leading for the outcomes. These decisions increasingly seem to be made 'at the front', the data experts. This presents challenges with regard to the management of the data experts.

Based on these signals, we conclude that further development of AI has both technical and organizational dimensions. Successful development and implementation of AI will therefore have to be linked to the organization of supervisory practices.

How are technical development of AI and the supervisory organization connected and how can this connection be improved? Much literature on AI focuses on technical possibilities, while other literature deals with ethical concerns. Far less literature discusses the actual implementation and use of AI in organizational practice. A study into this subject should have two characteristics:
The research is interdisciplinary. It has both innovative-technical aspects and social-scientific aspects. The question is about the interplay between the two.
Connected to practice. We are looking for the application of AI in the context of practice. That is why we want to conduct empirical research, using one or more cases. The research will be carried out in close collaboration with the Dutch Food and Product Safety Authority (NVWA).
Requirements
In this project you will study and develop arrangements that bring together the world of AI and managements of surveillance.

This requires understanding of AI (data science, machine learning, programming) and more intangible processes of organization, including organization structures, informal coordination and organizational politics. It includes both analysis and design efforts. It will involve conducting case studies at NVWA

We are looking for someone who:
has a Master's degree and a background in policy analysis, public administration or a related field
has affinity (and preferably also demonstratable experience) with AI
has affinity (and preferably also experience) with organizational science
has the ability and interest to cross disciplinary boundaries
is fluent in English, both written and orally
has pro-active communication skills and is able to work well in a team

Doing a PhD at TU Delft requires English proficiency at a certain level to ensure that the candidate is able to communicate and interact well, participate in English-taught Doctoral Education courses, and write scientific articles and a final thesis. For more details please check the Graduate Schools Admission Requirements.

Since the project is developed in close cooperation with a Dutch inspection agency (NVWA) that mostly communicates in Dutch, a candidate that speaks Dutch or is willing to learn the Dutch language is preferred.
Conditions of employment
Doctoral candidates will be offered a 4-year period of employment in principle, but in the form of 2 employment contracts. An initial 1,5 year contract with an official go/no go progress assessment within 15 months. Followed by an additional contract for the remaining 2,5 years assuming everything goes well and performance requirements are met.

Salary and benefits are in accordance with the Collective Labour Agreement for Dutch Universities, increasing from € 2541 per month in the first year to € 3247 in the fourth year. As a PhD candidate you will be enrolled in the TU Delft Graduate School. The TU Delft Graduate School provides an inspiring research environment with an excellent team of supervisors, academic staff and a mentor. The Doctoral Education Programme is aimed at developing your transferable, discipline-related and research skills.

The TU Delft offers a customisable compensation package, discounts on health insurance and sport memberships, and a monthly work costs contribution. Flexible work schedules can be arranged. For international applicants we offer the Coming to Delft Service and Partner Career Advice to assist you with your relocation.
