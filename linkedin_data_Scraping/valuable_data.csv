Als schrijfster & storyteller kun je mij zien als een gids in het vinden van de juiste woorden. Ik wijs je op het verhaal dat je wilt delen. Zo kun jij vanuit een sterk basisvertrouwen een krachtige boodschap uitdragen.

Daar kom je wanneer je bewust van bent dat je: 

op dit moment niet de juiste woorden kan vinden voor jouw aanbod. Je weet dat de juiste informatie echt verschil kan maken. Ook is voor jou duidelijk waar je over een jaar wilt staan en hoe je je onderneming wilt  laten groeien. Je bent net als ik ondernemend en graag in ontwikkeling.

Je hebt een product of idee voor jouw onderneming, maar de vertaling ervan naar een kloppend verhaal is niet jouw expertise. Je richt je aandacht op datgene wat je motiveert om je bedrijf te runnen. Het vinden van de juiste woorden besteed je liever uit, zodat je ook hierin kwaliteit kan waarborgen.

In de communicatie die je voor ogen hebt wil je in fijne en kloppende bewoordingen vermelden waar je product of aanbod over gaat. Hierdoor weten ook jouw klanten wat ze kunnen verwachten en waar ze aan toe zijn. Jouw aanbod krijgt de aandacht die het verdiend.

Jouw visie zorgt soms voor enige ruis in je plannen, want in de toekomst is er nu eenmaal veel mogelijk. Ordenen en helderheid geven dan een rustpunt. Samen kom ik met jou tot de kern van je product of aanbod, zodat de prioriteit duidelijk is. Putten uit de bron van wat je drijft is dan een uitkomst. Of zoals een klant mij teruggaf:

“Jij helpt mij buiten het vinden van de juiste woorden, steeds weer met het oppakken van de draad. Dit door mij te wijzen op het verhaal dat ik wil delen.” 

Hoe dit tot stand komt? Dat leg ik je graag uit in vier stappen:

1) Eerst gaan we het idee voor je product of aanbod onderzoeken.
→ Uit je hoofd in je ondernemershart!

2) Na dit onderzoek zorg ik voor een woordenplan: 
→ Dit geeft overzicht en helderheid.

3) Ik bouw jouw verhaal op. Verwerk eventuele feedback. Check, check, dubbelcheck.
→ Is dit de boodschap die je voor ogen had? Wat is nog nodig?

4) Het verhaal is nu klaar om online te presenteren.
→ Jij kunt nu jouw aanbod zichtbaar maken voor jouw potentiële klanten.

I believe in the 'you give and you shall receive' principle.

Enjoy life including your work and do not work because it have to or for the big money, but from your heart!
You do not have to be very rich to achieve your dream!
Do not look back, not forward, but enjoy every day.

I’m one of the descendants of my ancestor Cornelis Cornelisz Gielis (in the line of my mother's family) born in Den Helder, Netherlands 1675 - died 2 July 1722 on board of the ship King Solomon. He was a Dutch whaler and sea shipper, navigator, cartographer, commander for whaling and polar explorer. Gielis traveled north of Nordaustlandet in Svalbard, and managed to reach a degree farther north of Sjuøyane without encountering ice. A published abstract in the Royal Geographical Society's proceedings remarked in 1873 that such voyages ""have never been equalled up to the present day"". Gielis was commander Greenland in the period 1700-1722. He mapped the ice seas around the Norwegian archipelago Spitsbergen together with commander Outger Rep. This data was used for the Spitsbergen map of Gerard van Keulen 1678-1726 from 1710. As commander on his third voyage, in 1707 Gielis discovered an unknown high land at 80 degrees north the island of (nowadays called) Kvitøya which would not be seen again until 1876. The location appeared on charts as ""Giles Land, Gielis island"" for a number of years. The Gilessundet inlet in Svalbard was named in his honor."

🌱 After graduating in Business Psychology, I delved into some fascinating subjects — like the links between our decision-making tendencies and our overall happiness. It amazes me what our minds can reveal!

🌱 Jump to the present: Here I am in the lovely Netherlands, excited to embark on my MSc journey. And why consumer psychology? To put it simply, I'm drawn to understanding the daily choices we all make and the motivations behind them.

🌱 My latest aspiration? Merging my understanding of CX with product management. With so much to learn, I can't wait to connect dots, innovate, and shape products that truly resonate with people.

Zelf ben ik nooit gestimuleerd in het ontdekken van mijn talenten. ""Vroeger was ik zo’n kwetsbare jongere. Klein zelfbeeld, ik geloofde niet in mezelf en wist niet eens dat ik talenten had."" Na een bijzondere gebeurtenis en radicale keuze ben ik een andere weg ingegaan. Een weg die gepaard ging met veel vallen en opstaan maar mijn stoutste dromen zijn uitgekomen en het was nooit saai.

 ""Daarom vind ik het belangrijk om in anderen te investeren met het vinden van hun talent.""

Je bent bijzonder en uniek:

Er is er maar een van u op de wereld en als het goed is: een authentiek en compleet mens in balans, Helaas ziet men zichzelf niet altijd als een prachtig juweel, maar waar anderen in u een ruwe steen zien, en waar die steen bewerkt wordt met liefde, geduld en vakmanschap, dan ontstaat er een schitterende diamant.

Mijn inspiratie:

De film The Butterfly Circus met Nick Vujicic. 

Een negentien minuten durende film 
Daarom is mijn missie:

In de blauwdruk van ieders DNA staan al onze talenten beschreven en zijn bij iedereen aanwezig. We mogen elkaar helpen om die talenten te vinden en ze te activeren. Samen gaan we opzoek naar uw talent en die te voeden met enthousiasme en doorzettingsvermogen en waardoor u uw stoutste dromen kunt laten uitkomen."

I have a solid knowledge in law enforcement investigative techniques, most important in money laundering techniques and methods, also in financial investigation techniques and methods as well as knowledge and experience of the techniques relating to the identification, freezing, management and confiscation of assets.
Many times, I proved that I can work in stressful conditions, and I participated in many cases of criminal investigation and countering organized crime.
Also, I have excellent written and verbal communication skills, I get along extremely well with my colleagues and I earned everyone’s trust due to my commitment to work. "

"" — Since the beginning of my entrepreneurial journey, I have always been fascinated with how meaningful and transcendent results are achieved when working in synergy as a team and as a community. I have learned to value co-creation and I have shaped my behavior to promote collaboration, empathy and the importance of sharing ideas. This facilitates new coincidences and solves issues from a solutions-oriented perspective, by integrating new ideas, minds, and people together.

As it happens in open source software, working ethically, transparently and openly with people, always brings a solution to complex challenges. A responsible leader promotes and embodies these concepts.

I'm a strong believer that technology can make a positive influence on individuals, their environment, the ecosystem, and help us build a better future, where opportunities and access to information could be used for having a favorable impact on people's life."""

Trained as an anthropologist, I'm specialized in ethnographic research on violence, (dis)order, (prison) governance and state-(un)making, particularly in Nicaragua. Currently I also work on these topics in the city of Amsterdam, as PI on the research project ""Het Ongelijkheidsbeginsel"" (the principle of inequality), which takes a holistic approach to understand the ways in which urban inequalities (spatial, socio-economic and racial/ethnic) are mitigated and/or reproduced through criminal justice interventions.

At the same time, I continue to research practices of (para-)policing, imprisonment, state crime and organized crime in Nicaragua. In relation to the 2018 protests and their aftermath, I work with (former) political prisoners and their family members, Nicaraguan exiles and refugees, and human rights activists. I am currently working on two book projects. The first is a volume co-edited with Hanneke Stuit and Jennifer Turner, which is titled ""Carceral Worlds"" (Bloomsbury). The book critically explores the expansion of carcerality in our globalized present and how this may be unsettled. The second is a manuscript based on my doctoral thesis, which was awarded a cum laude distinction. The thesis, ""Performing Prison: Power, Agency and Co-Governance in Nicaraguan Prisons"", was based on 31 months of multi-sited ethnographic research conducted between 2009 and 2016 with long and short-sentenced (former) prisoners of three Nicaraguan prison facilities. This book is about the ways in which prisoners negotiate power both inside and outside their cells, documenting and theorizing the emergence of Nicaragua's hybrid carceral state.

In general, I am interested in the day-to-day workings of prison life and the (development) of carceral/penal states, policing and other forms of non-state/extralegal surveillance and governance. In doing so, I focus on questions of (il)legitimacy, violence and the body. I participate actively in a number of interdisciplinary networks on confinement and prisons research, including the Global Prisons Research Network (as a co-organizer), the EASA Anthropology of Confinement Network (co-convener 2018-2022), and the Americas Prisons Research Network/Red Penitenciaria de las Americas (founding member), with whom I organize various events.

Born in the US and currently living in the Netherlands, I'm a digital storyteller that's passionate about beautiful places and spaces. I love to create aesthetic content that captures the essence of my travels, and share stories and recommendations with my dedicated global audience of over 95,000.
I enjoy a wide variety of travel experiences, and use my content to encourage others to explore the world for themselves.

I've explored a number of places and professions in the years following my graduation from the University of Connecticut, where I graduated with a 3.53 GPA and two degrees in English and Psychology. I always knew I loved to write and that I was fascinated with the human mind, but I discovered another passion during my college years- traveling. In 2008 I made my first international trip count, and spent four months studying in Sydney, Australia. I developed an insatiable appetite for world travel that year, which might explain how I came to be where I am today- living abroad and discovering new places whenever I can!
 
In Bangkok, I was the Franchise Development Manager for Coldwell Banker Thailand, the first franchise office of the American real estate brand to come to Asia. In addition to finding potential franchisees in Thailand, I was the company’s social media manager. I wrote blog articles, photographed properties, and focused on creating an online presence in a country that is heavily centered around Facebook and Instagram. The role helped to refine my creative skills and ultimately led to a decision to pursue my interests independently. I currently manage a travel blog, girlgoneabroad.com and use my online influence and content creation skills to work with amazing brands in the travel niche.

After completing high school, I worked in the hospitality branch with Mise en Place. Here, I had the opportunity to attend international conferences and diplomatic events as a garcon. This further inspired me to join this community. 

Therefore, I opted for the program of European Studies at the The Hague University of Applied Sciences. This program is a wide-ranging course that provides students with the know-how to become European professionals. During this program, I gained skills ranging from political science to marketing. 
As an extracurricular activity, I joined the international organization of Enactus where I have developed a social enterprise that had the aim to empower women with a migrant background to improve the integration process as project leader. 

The program of European Studies has allowed me to conduct an with the University of Malta. This was the place where both my interest in the Mediterranean region and the values for the EU came together. Consequently, I decided to write my bachelor's thesis on the adherence to the EU’s Common Fundamental Values to protect the freedom of the press comparing Malta and Slovakia. 
After returning to The Hague, I decided to conduct my internship in Cyprus. The internship for DOREA Educational Institute allowed me to thoroughly analyze European policy together with the dynamics and needs of the European population. Based on this analysis I participated in developing training courses for DOREA. I am especially proud of the launch of the training course: “education for sustainable development” that I have developed from the early stages.

After graduating from The Hague University of Applied Sciences, I have decided to further develop my knowledge on the Mediterranean region starting the Master’s program of European Union and Human Rights Studies at the Catholic University of Murcia. The program connected me with peers from all continents discussing contemporary issues with highly skilled lecturers such as ambassador Javier Vallaure, Bichara Khader and director of Social Economy Europe, Víctor Meseguer. I have conducted an internship with Social Economy Europe where I have gained insight into the social economy and advocacy, as well as social media content creation and monitoring. Finally, I have utilized my passion for Europe by writing my final master’s thesis on the importance of European identity building by virtue of my participation in the Erasmus program."

In 2015 I completed the bachelor's degree programme Mathematics at the Vrije
Universiteit Amsterdam. This study comprised of math topics like algebra,
analysis, probability theory, statistics and topology, and other useful skills
like computer programming (Java and C++), giving presentations and scientific
writing.

At the end of my bachelor's I learned how one can use Vim digraphs and the
XeLaTeX package unicode-math to add math symbols to documents in a more
convenient way. For instance, to add the symbol β, one normally has to type
""\beta"", but with this method one only has to enter ""b<backspace>*"" which
results in the typing of β directly in the .tex document. Then, the package

Working at Li La Land, creating innovative products to support, inspire and challenge young children to explore the world around them. Co-authored the book 'Speel je mee in Li La Land'​ together with the amazing Irma Smegen, describing 50 detailed activities combining Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math (STEAM) with language and socio-emotional development. In addition the book provides a strong theoretical basis for a comprehensive and most importantly practical approach to primary education that is truly in tune with the development of a child's young brain and mind. 

WHAT I BRING:
Thinking on how to describe my natural role within a group I came up with the word ‘Vonkeling’. Although it doesn’t exist in Dutch, I derived the word from ‘vonk’, meaning spark, making a Vonkeling ‘someone who sparks’. These sparks can be anything from new ideas and concepts, perspectives or insights, depending on what the situation asks for. Being an artist I’m able to compose stories with words or visuals that spark connections between the people involved. After all, data points and abstractly formulated values have never motivated people, but well-presented stories can push us to move mountains. This makes me a strong brainstormer and concept developer who can also bring different people together to make ideas become reality. My enthusiasm has been characterised as being 'contagious'​ and I love igniting other people's passions to strive for our shared goals.

About math, I work writing Math content in English and Portuguese language. I also teach international and Brazilian students how come from Dutch or International schools, giving them online and in person private math classes. 

I am very attentive and responsive to my pupils, using educational methods that really could help my student to achieve their goals. 

As I am a pet lover, I decided  to open my own pet care company in Amsterdam. It is called Petzz Life and this business have been growing. 

I am open for new experiences in Math teaching and content producing. I hope my introduction clarifies about how I am. 

Thanks for reading."

My mission is to find AI applications that benefit society and can help tackle some of the worldwide problems facing humanity. My preferred method is to address these problems at their source, the human mind. I'm interested in topics related to the brain, neuro and mental health and psychedelics, which will likely play a crucial role in the future. I believe there is great therapeutic potential in experiential therapies, incorporating tailored music and art with a facilitating, monitoring and aiding role for technology.

Language is another powerful medium for communication which contains 
meaningful information about what goes on in the human mind and the collective. This makes Natural Language Processing an invaluable tool for bridging the gap between first and third-person perspectives.
I'm fascinated by new technological advancements in the field of VR/AR and brain-computer interfaces, which will radically shift the ways in which humans and machines interact.

Since I started my study in chemistry in 1981, I am particularly intrigued by its fundamental aspects. In that perspective, a specialization in physical chemistry was a logical choice. Chemical accounting, aquatic chemistry and particularly chemical thermodynamics and phase theory have my special interest.
The most inspiring and challenging part of what I do as a lecturer, is to show the students the beauty of these (logical but sometimes difficult) domains and to encourage them to look on to it. The biggest reward being the moment when the penny drops. 

In addition to teaching, I like to work on improving the environment in which students can work on their future. This I mainly do as member of the board of examiners. For me the personal approach is always the starting point.

I acquired knowledge about all different fields of Chemistry and I showed an exceptional interest in Inorganic and Analytical. The title of my BSc thesis was “Carbonates and crystalline compounds they form with Na+ and NH4+, and Vanadium (IV/V) as a catalyst”. 

My studies in MSc Analytical Science for Industry at King's College London encouraged my interest in the field. I was instructed about the most modern analytical techniques applied in the industry and laboratories worldwide. Among advanced analytical techniques such as GC-MS and HPLC-MS, including all different types of mass analyzer and modes of ionization in mass spectrometry, I was also taught about emerging technologies, such as point of care testing, supercritical fluid chromatography, ICP-MS, orbitrap, lab-on-a-chip and micro-fluidics, evaporative light scattering detection, as well as immunoassay, ion pairing chromatography and electrophoresis. My MSc thesis was focused on hand dishwashing liquids and I studied their effects on glass surfaces by coupling Liquid Chromatography to Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) at Procter & Gamble and their Brussels Innovation Centre. 

I then completed my PGCE in Science (with a focus on Chemistry) and I was rated as 'Outstanding'. I was lucky enough to complete both of my school placements in 'Outstanding' Inner London schools, which helped me with developing the following skills up to a very high standard: lesson planning, behaviour management, use of literacy in science, assessment for learning and differentiation. I am passionate about Chemistry and thoroughly enjoy teaching it. My students, both in school and in one-to-one sessions, are of various abilities and as such I have developed methods that aim to stretch the more able, as well as support less able students through scaffolding to achieve their full potential. 

I know that every student has a different way of learning and therefore adapt my lessons accordingly and have a wealth of resources for all levels. I am well versed in teaching Science at Key Stage 3, as well as 11+ (‘Common Entrance’), GCSE, and A-level. My strongest assets are deep subject knowledge as well as the ability to build positive relationships with my students, teaching focused lessons whilst ensuring my students are enjoying their learning. Outside of the classroom, I am a very keen skier and I love to travel. Thank you for taking the time to read my bio."

The results of my research activity have been published in journals of high impact factor (IF) as Nano Letters, ACSnano, Phys Rev Lett... 
The investigated systems range from Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs), monatomic C chains, BN nanoribbons, III-V semiconductor nanowires, multiferroic materials. 
These investigations have lead to a deep understanding of the fundamental physical properties of one-dimensional systems that, in turn, is essential to design new nanoelectronic and spintronic devices and/or improve their performances. For this reason, these works are often conducted in direct collaboration with experimentalists.
For instance, I have investigated a number of functionalization schemes of CNTs in order to achieve selective detection of various gas molecules. I have employed NEGF and DFT to predict spin-polarized electron transport in monatomic C chains connected to graphene nanoribbons, hence simulating the behavior of all-C nanoelectronic devices. 
I have experience also in using beyond-DFT techniques as the GW approximation. I have used GW to compute the band-gap of the wurtzite polymorph of InAs and GaAs in order to explain photoluminescence measurements (performed by myself) on III-V NWs. Recently, I've performed further modelling of III-V NWs to identify the optimal conditions to grow straight InAs–on–GaAs NW heterostructures. Presently, I'm modelling magnetic multiferroic superlattices, aiming at applications as spintronic devices and, in particular, magnetically readable and electrically writable random access memories (M-RAM).

Open hands, good eye contact, smiling, good posture, respect for others’ personal space: these are all part of good communication. Having good body language establishes trust and means students will not only have more confidence in you, but will want to listen to and work with you. 
By using three languages confidently, I become better at observing my surroundings and adept at focusing on relevant information and editing out the irrelevant. I tend to make more rational decisions. Because any language contains nuance and subtle implications in its vocabulary, and these biases can subconsciously influence my judgment. Good language means that my diction is clear and audible, my sentences are concise, my thought processes are logical and my delivery is flowing.

A natural sceintist loves to explain things. The ability to explain things clearly and effectively can help the scientist to become a good teacher.

For my PhD research I am investigating how active treatment (i.e. flushing and aerating) of waste within landfills could reduce the contaminant release of the waste. If reduced in a sufficient amount, this could mean other more costly measures for prevent environmental contamination are no longer needed.

Before starting as a PhD student, I followed the master programme ""Earth & Environment"", during which I specialised in the biology and chemistry of soil and water with a specific focus on soil chemistry. For this programme, I wrote a master thesis about the calcium chloride extraction, and how varying factors within this extraction affected measured concentration of zinc, copper, and dissolved organic matter. Furthermore, I interned at NMI agro, during which I created a simple model capable of predicting nutrient leaching towards surface waters on a field scale.

In 2010, I was appointed as assistant professor (tenure tracker) at Leiden University, and moved to Naturalis Biodiversity Center (Leiden, The Netherlands) as permanent researcher in 2014, where I was promoted as senior researcher in 2018 and group leader in 2020. I was a visiting postdoc at Leiden University in 2006, at the University of Utah (USA) in 2009, and visiting professor at the University of Bordeaux (France) in 2013 and 2014.

During my PhD period as teaching assistant (2000-2005), I studied evolutionary and ecological signals in the wood anatomy of flowering plants. My postdoc internship in the Sperry lab (Univ. of Utah, USA) taught me how to perform water flow measurements in stems, which enabled me to functionally interpret wood anatomical observations with respect to different levels of drought stress resistance between species, with particular emphasis on the ultrastructure of intervessel pits. The outcome of this anatomical-hydraulic work has resulted in an award-winning paper on maples in New Phytologist (Tansley Medal for Excellence in Plant Science in 2010). Another line of research that has always fascinated me as an evolutionary biologist is to understand the frequent life form transitions in flowering plants, especially the growth form transition from herbaceousness towards (derived) woodiness. I just finished a unique global dataset on derived woodiness in flowering plants, showing that derived woodiness has evolved at least 600 times independently, which raises the intriguing question which (a)biotic factors triggered wood formation in all these lineages. Most of these derived woody species are native to dry continental vegetation types, which may point to palaeoclimatic drought periods as potential drivers behind wood formation in various herbaceous groups. 

In addition to the question why plants became woody during evolutionary history, I am interested to know what are the genes that have turned on the wood pathway in all these hundreds of derived woody groups using gene expression and QTL experiments in Arabidopsis and relatives. I hope my research could contribute to complementary directions, such as inducing woody and thus more drought resistant and taller phenotypes in otherwise herbaceous crops that may help us to produce more food in a world where plant growth will become more demanding due to climate change.

You stumbled upon that crazy student, who felt bored at the lectures and afterward always run to do some ""board meeting"", ""project"" or ""event"" instead of a beer.

During my bachelors I felt dissatisfied with largely theoretical nature of the studies, therefore I decided to run multiple of initiatives. Firstly, I led project Tea-at-5, where hundreds of students had a chance to practice conversations in English directly with foreigners. Lately,  I co-founded the first club of psychologist at our university, where we delivered workshops and brought alumni and external speakers to give practical advices. 

However, most of my activity of my bachelor studies belonged to youth leadership organization AIESEC which feed my need for experiences the most. From very first year I become a board member at AIESEC university office and later became a trainer at country level in Slovakia. All this knowledge & experience I utilized to get to a full-time position of country head of HR at AIESEC in Nepal. There I supported intensive growth and re-shaping of the organization, that was still recovering after massive earthquakes that happened a year before.

Lastly, I had also great opportunity to work at HR department in Dell in Slovakia. I am very grateful for a chance to meet a lot of HR professionals from whom I learned a lot about how human resources operates in the international company. 

Though above experiences shaped who I am, I'm would more likely define myself by my 3 core values of: Constant Improvement, Education & Honesty and my personal mission to contribute to improvement & innovation in education sector.

Hello, I am Jakub Patrik. My deep interests are programming and business, a perfect balance of both. I've dived into computer science only a couple of years ago, yet I consider myself an independent and curiosity-driven student with a rapid learning curve.

🧠Coding Skills
I've been proudly creating websites, both raw HTML, CSS, JS, and WordPress. Further, I discovered Java and Python, where I landed my logical programming foundations. However, to take it one more step ahead I shifted my focus towards programming apps in Flutter-cross platform programming toolkit developed by Google.

💪Business Skills
I've started my marketing journey with an internship as an Online Marketing Intern, where I've successfully helped promote standup events all over Slovakia. Next, I've been expanding my knowledge with numerous Google Analytics or Ads Search courses. 

Motto😎
""When one wants to build something, he must be able to sell it.""

So why does it always end up
destroying the local environment? From an early age, this self-destructive paradox has both frustrated
and fascinated me. So much so, that people even started calling me Island Girl. After years of research on this topic, I am confident that if done correctly, tourism can fuel the growth of environmental resources instead of degrading them. This is not an easy task and requires many different stakeholders cooperating across industries.

My passion for island sustainability made me very aware of how vulnerable coastal areas are to climate
change. In September 2017 the true urgency hit me. While working on a project on the island
of Dominica, I experienced Maria: a category 5 hurricane that turned the entire country to rubble in only a few hours. This was a wakeup call for me that despite the importance of research, the window for action that actually makes a difference is closing.

To help island nations become more resilient against catastrophes like the one I experienced, I look at the big picture, break it down, and identify steps that can be taken to achieve the long-term desired results. For this reason, I enjoy working on creative projects with businesses (e.g. hotels) and also at the destination-level on strategic direction. I am interested in many aspects of sustainability, but if I would have to name one main area where I want to make a difference, it would be protecting animals and their habitats – but I believe that this goes hand in hand with creating long-term economic and social prosperity. 

My mission is support islands in protecting their environment in a way that makes both common and financial sense."

My journey in the space community started a bit by good fortune back in 2000 from my home country, Spain. At the time, I was most interested in bio-engineering and had just returned from an Erasmus programme in Greece. An opportunity for a one-year secondment within a French space company aroused and my employer thought of me as a candidate.  After this position, I returned to Madrid, then left again for France which was followed by an experience in the UK. Now I am settled in the Netherlands.

Some of the most exciting moments of my career so far took place during the launch campaigns and LEOP. Finally, the rocket lifts off. On board are the satellites you and many others have been working on for years, but all I can think about are technical questions related to my field of expertise: are batteries sufficiently charged to support the initial activities, will solar arrays deploy as planned? Perfectionism is my weak point…

I enjoy working in the multicultural work environment at the European Space Agency. I am native Spanish speaker fluent in two foreign languages both spoken with a Spanish accent.

De studio, gesitueerd in Amsterdam, stelt film- en televisiemakers in staat om op een groot LED-scherm iedere gewenste achtergrond of omgeving weer te geven. Met deze innovatieve manier van filmen kunnen traditionele filmsets virtueel worden uitgebreid, waarbij o.a. gebruik wordt gemaakt van de laatste technieken uit de game industrie.

In het kader van duurzaamheid is virtual production een welkome technologie die overal ter wereld in opkomst is, vaak met Disney’s recente productie The Mandalorian als lichtend voorbeeld. Met een hele film crew afreizen naar verre locaties kent nu een aantrekkelijk alternatief. Ook efficiëntie is een belangrijk pluspunt bij de toch al dure filmopnames, bijvoorbeeld doordat ongunstige weersomstandigheden met deze techniek vermeden worden. De coronapandemie heeft de ontwikkeling van virtual production in een stroomversnelling gebracht.

Het hoofdscherm van ReadySet Studios is 14 meter breed en 5,5 meter hoog met een groot LED-plafond en apart verrijdbaar scherm. De opstelling maakt gebruik van hoogwaardige display-technologie en is geïnstalleerd door het toonaangevende Nederlandse bedrijf Faber Audiovisuals.

In 2020, I obtained an MSc in Cultural Anthropology and Development Studies at the Radboud University in Nijmegen, for which I conducted ethnographic research on post-conflict social change through artistic storytelling promoted by community-based projects in Northern Ireland. Resulting in the following thesis: Narrating futures: an ethnographic take on artistic storytelling in the Theatre of Witness as a means to an end in Northern Ireland's quest for peace. 

After several research experiences in the Philippines and Northern Ireland, I now work as a junior researcher at the Radboud University, studying gender-based violence in post-conflict Northern Ireland. 

I also work as a volunteer at Jales, a non-profit developmental organization that is focused on offering financial support to provide educational opportunities for poor children in the Philippines. 

I aspire to bring about societal change where that is needed through research, education, and, or, work within a developmental organization. Through this work, I aim to contribute to knowledge about how we ‘together’ - as human beings - can envision and work towards a better future

Being involved in development work for more than 25 years, I’ve been mainly focused on capacity building, organizational development and facilitating strategic processes.

I do not consider enrolling the university when I was 16, which makes me the youngest student in my country, or delivering training workshops for over 10,000 people from around 20 countries, as my biggest professional achievements. I am especially proud of little things that don't usually make it onto a resume:
1.	Investing all the money I earned from my own business at the age of 23 in post-graduation studies;
2.	Never losing faith, in spite of countless failures and mistakes (e.g. I passed the driver’s license exam after the eleventh attempt);
3.	After finding myself in a fight between two thugs and feeling a cold fork on my neck, managing to reconcile them and make them continue their quarrel at the bar, each of them insisting to pay the bill😊;
4.	Being disciplined and sticking to my diet for two weeks in a five-star hotel with the most delicious, exotic food😊
According to Gallup's study on the State of the Global Workplace in 142 countries, only 13% of employees worldwide are engaged at work. In other words, only about one in eight workers are psychologically committed to their jobs and unhappy employees create unhappy organizations uncapable of using their potential fully.
Other studies demonstrate that stakeholder engagement and effective communication are key factors in the success or failure of a project.
This is my “why”, my reasons why I have committed myself in both, organizational development through personal growth and improving development processes through effective with stakeholders’ participation.

Her responsibilities included advising mission leadership, Government and Non-state actors on issues relating to children in armed conflict, monitoring and reporting on grave child rights violations, and building the capacity of local actors to stop and prevent child recruitment and sexual abuse. She has worked to mitigate the impact of armed conflicts on children for more 25 years. 

Among her achievements in the DRC is the release of more than 3,000 children through direct face to face negotiation with armed group leaders in North and South Kivu, between 2018 and 2020, meeting the warlords on their own territory.  These meetings led to irreversible change, as 29 of the 31 rebel leaders that Dee met reportedly did not recruit any girls or boys after the negotiations.

Before joining the United Nations Dee worked for a number of international NGO’s in other war-affected countries, including Kosovo, Albania, Sri Lanka, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Guinea and East Timor. Her main areas of interest are prevention, rehabilitation and reintegration of child soldiers, child rights promotion through media (TV, radio and print) and advocacy. 

In 1999 Dee wrote a 10-part drama series for Young Asia television (YA TV) which included topics such as child soldiers, slavery, HIV/AIDS, sex tourism, the caste system, arranged marriages and child suicide. YA TV is an English speaking channel, reaching 200 million young viewers in Sri Lanka, Nepal, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. 

Before embarking on a career in war zones, Dee was a soap writer in the Netherlands."

This background I believe, has allowed me to view conservation situations in a broader and more open-minded way, and continues to motivate me to explore the various ontologies that exist in how conservation is viewed and carried out, in order to find ways and solutions that would benefit both people and nature.

I feel driven by purpose, curiosity, passion, commitment, dedication, and the drive to create change by spearheading conservation action through science and public engagement. I believe sharing stories in tandem with scientific research, experiences, and photography and film, has the power to enhance our collective awareness of the beauty of nature but it also exposes the harsh realities and the catastrophic problems at hand in the field of conservation. I believe, however, that at the fork of the dichotomy, lies a void that is to be filled by inspiring and creative ideas and solutions. A void, that not only encourages a new way of thinking, but a void that also encourages us to reflect and to rekindle our connection with ourselves and with nature, thereby bringing about concrete change. I hope to inspire and engage other young conservationists, whilst giving a voice to nature and wildlife and in so doing, propelling conservation research and solutions for the betterment of humanity, and nature."

About making it possible, through research, start-ups/scale-ups and (impact) investments. 

My current work focus is on scaling enterprises active in the WASH sector and increasing their impact. I do this within my position at Aqua for All as Technical Assistance (TA) Manager for the Impact-Linked Fund for Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (ILF for WASH), a follow-up the ‘Social Impact Incentives (SIINC) for WASH’ programme. In this role, I'm responsible for designing and managing all TA activities that are part of ILF for WASH. The full focus of the TA is on Impact Measurement & Management (IMM) and Investment Readiness (IR). 

ILF for WASH is co-designed and implemented by Aqua for All and our partner Roots of Impact. The purpose is to provide (financial) rewards to enterprises that create (more/better/faster) positive social and environmental impact (additionality). The payments are based on the achievement of pre-defined outcomes and incentivise enterprises to further deepen their impact whilst, at the same time, enabling them to raise private investment and scale. In other words, the enterprise receives “better terms for better impact”.

My added value lies in my broad view and empathy, my analytic attitude, writing and presentation skills, and in my approach to relation & stakeholder management. 

I have the ability to quickly put information in the right context, smoothly coordinate projects, I work thoroughly with a great eye for detail, am flexible and I master three languages (Native Dutch, Full Professional English and Limited Working Spanish).

Creativity is my strongest point, for this reason technology supplies captured my interest with deep passion that it became my first set up company. It gave me that ability to make conventional technology unconventional (obsolete or contemporary). 

The first ever Interactive touch screen installed in MTN Nigeria both at Aromire(Reception) and The Plaza HR department was installed by H3oMT in 2011 and 2012 respectively when this technology was relatively new to the world. This was my initiative which I proposed to the organisation and I was offered a proof of concept purchase order due to the fact that no one within the organisation had seen such except in science fiction films. Thus I funded it myself and was reimburse when it was installed and functioning properly as they envisaged. This depicts our role as a pioneer in technological innovation.

We have gone on to supply innovative technological corporate gift to big organisations around African continent; 
LG  Kenya
Dulux Nigeria 
NIC Bank Kenya 
CBA Bank Kenya 
Liquid Telecom UK
Liquid Telecom Kenya 
Chase Bank Kenya 
Etisalat Nigeria just to mention few. 

We live in an ever evolving world and H3omt has come to realise that a company can also generate passive income by investing in other business sectors infusing our technological means to enhance productivity. We are currently working with few companies in the following business sectors; 
Agribusiness
Real Estate
Business Consulting Services
Logistics Services. 

We also invest in other companies that aligns our interest and add value to our business, investors and service users. Our investment capacity are in any of the three categories which generally are:
Minority passive (less than 20% ownership)
Minority active (20%-50% ownership)
Controlling interest (over 50% ownership)

During my master's degree in Structural Engineering, I did research in the field of computational mechanics applied to Fracture Mechanics at LMCV (Laboratory of Computational Mechanics and Visualization - http://www.lmcv.ufc.br/). My master's thesis dealt with the analysis of cracking in quasi-brittle materials using using the Finite Element Method. In order to solve the resulting non-linear material damage evolution problem, interface elements featuring different types of cohesive-zone models were used.

Currently, I am trying to broaden my experiences by pursuing a job as an engineer. I have particular interest in structural engineering with focus on numerical modeling and design.
