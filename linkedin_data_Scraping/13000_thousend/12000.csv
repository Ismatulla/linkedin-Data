Als schrijfster & storyteller kun je mij zien als een gids in het vinden van de juiste woorden. Ik wijs je op het verhaal dat je wilt delen. Zo kun jij vanuit een sterk basisvertrouwen een krachtige boodschap uitdragen.

Daar kom je wanneer je bewust van bent dat je: 

op dit moment niet de juiste woorden kan vinden voor jouw aanbod. Je weet dat de juiste informatie echt verschil kan maken. Ook is voor jou duidelijk waar je over een jaar wilt staan en hoe je je onderneming wilt  laten groeien. Je bent net als ik ondernemend en graag in ontwikkeling.

Je hebt een product of idee voor jouw onderneming, maar de vertaling ervan naar een kloppend verhaal is niet jouw expertise. Je richt je aandacht op datgene wat je motiveert om je bedrijf te runnen. Het vinden van de juiste woorden besteed je liever uit, zodat je ook hierin kwaliteit kan waarborgen.

In de communicatie die je voor ogen hebt wil je in fijne en kloppende bewoordingen vermelden waar je product of aanbod over gaat. Hierdoor weten ook jouw klanten wat ze kunnen verwachten en waar ze aan toe zijn. Jouw aanbod krijgt de aandacht die het verdiend.

Jouw visie zorgt soms voor enige ruis in je plannen, want in de toekomst is er nu eenmaal veel mogelijk. Ordenen en helderheid geven dan een rustpunt. Samen kom ik met jou tot de kern van je product of aanbod, zodat de prioriteit duidelijk is. Putten uit de bron van wat je drijft is dan een uitkomst. Of zoals een klant mij teruggaf:

“Jij helpt mij buiten het vinden van de juiste woorden, steeds weer met het oppakken van de draad. Dit door mij te wijzen op het verhaal dat ik wil delen.” 

Hoe dit tot stand komt? Dat leg ik je graag uit in vier stappen:

1) Eerst gaan we het idee voor je product of aanbod onderzoeken.
→ Uit je hoofd in je ondernemershart!

2) Na dit onderzoek zorg ik voor een woordenplan: 
→ Dit geeft overzicht en helderheid.

3) Ik bouw jouw verhaal op. Verwerk eventuele feedback. Check, check, dubbelcheck.
→ Is dit de boodschap die je voor ogen had? Wat is nog nodig?

4) Het verhaal is nu klaar om online te presenteren.
→ Jij kunt nu jouw aanbod zichtbaar maken voor jouw potentiële klanten.

I believe in the 'you give and you shall receive' principle.

Enjoy life including your work and do not work because it have to or for the big money, but from your heart!
You do not have to be very rich to achieve your dream!
Do not look back, not forward, but enjoy every day.

I’m one of the descendants of my ancestor Cornelis Cornelisz Gielis (in the line of my mother's family) born in Den Helder, Netherlands 1675 - died 2 July 1722 on board of the ship King Solomon. He was a Dutch whaler and sea shipper, navigator, cartographer, commander for whaling and polar explorer. Gielis traveled north of Nordaustlandet in Svalbard, and managed to reach a degree farther north of Sjuøyane without encountering ice. A published abstract in the Royal Geographical Society's proceedings remarked in 1873 that such voyages ""have never been equalled up to the present day"". Gielis was commander Greenland in the period 1700-1722. He mapped the ice seas around the Norwegian archipelago Spitsbergen together with commander Outger Rep. This data was used for the Spitsbergen map of Gerard van Keulen 1678-1726 from 1710. As commander on his third voyage, in 1707 Gielis discovered an unknown high land at 80 degrees north the island of (nowadays called) Kvitøya which would not be seen again until 1876.

🌱 After graduating in Business Psychology, I delved into some fascinating subjects — like the links between our decision-making tendencies and our overall happiness. It amazes me what our minds can reveal!

🌱 Jump to the present: Here I am in the lovely Netherlands, excited to embark on my MSc journey. And why consumer psychology? To put it simply, I'm drawn to understanding the daily choices we all make and the motivations behind them.

🌱 My latest aspiration? Merging my understanding of CX with product management. With so much to learn, I can't wait to connect dots, innovate, and shape products that truly resonate with people.

Zelf ben ik nooit gestimuleerd in het ontdekken van mijn talenten. ""Vroeger was ik zo’n kwetsbare jongere. Klein zelfbeeld, ik geloofde niet in mezelf en wist niet eens dat ik talenten had."" Na een bijzondere gebeurtenis en radicale keuze ben ik een andere weg ingegaan. Een weg die gepaard ging met veel vallen en opstaan maar mijn stoutste dromen zijn uitgekomen en het was nooit saai.

 ""Daarom vind ik het belangrijk om in anderen te investeren met het vinden van hun talent.""

Je bent bijzonder en uniek:

Er is er maar een van u op de wereld en als het goed is: een authentiek en compleet mens in balans, Helaas ziet men zichzelf niet altijd als een prachtig juweel, maar waar anderen in u een ruwe steen zien, en waar die steen bewerkt wordt met liefde, geduld en vakmanschap, dan ontstaat er een schitterende diamant.

Mijn inspiratie:

De film The Butterfly Circus met Nick Vujicic. 

Een negentien minuten durende film 
Daarom is mijn missie:

In de blauwdruk van ieders DNA staan al onze talenten beschreven en zijn bij iedereen aanwezig. We mogen elkaar helpen om die talenten te vinden en ze te activeren. Samen gaan we opzoek naar uw talent en die te voeden met enthousiasme en doorzettingsvermogen en waardoor u uw stoutste dromen kunt laten uitkomen."

"" — Since the beginning of my entrepreneurial journey, I have always been fascinated with how meaningful and transcendent results are achieved when working in synergy as a team and as a community. I have learned to value co-creation and I have shaped my behavior to promote collaboration, empathy and the importance of sharing ideas. This facilitates new coincidences and solves issues from a solutions-oriented perspective, by integrating new ideas, minds, and people together.

As it happens in open source software, working ethically, transparently and openly with people, always brings a solution to complex challenges. A responsible leader promotes and embodies these concepts.

I'm a strong believer that technology can make a positive influence on individuals, their environment, the ecosystem, and help us build a better future, where opportunities and access to information could be used for having a favorable impact on people's life."""

Trained as an anthropologist, I'm specialized in ethnographic research on violence, (dis)order, (prison) governance and state-(un)making, particularly in Nicaragua. Currently I also work on these topics in the city of Amsterdam, as PI on the research project ""Het Ongelijkheidsbeginsel"" (the principle of inequality), which takes a holistic approach to understand the ways in which urban inequalities (spatial, socio-economic and racial/ethnic) are mitigated and/or reproduced through criminal justice interventions.

At the same time, I continue to research practices of (para-)policing, imprisonment, state crime and organized crime in Nicaragua. In relation to the 2018 protests and their aftermath, I work with (former) political prisoners and their family members, Nicaraguan exiles and refugees, and human rights activists. I am currently working on two book projects. The first is a volume co-edited with Hanneke Stuit and Jennifer Turner, which is titled ""Carceral Worlds"" (Bloomsbury). The book critically explores the expansion of carcerality in our globalized present and how this may be unsettled. The second is a manuscript based on my doctoral thesis, which was awarded a cum laude distinction. The thesis, ""Performing Prison: Power, Agency and Co-Governance in Nicaraguan Prisons"", was based on 31 months of multi-sited ethnographic research conducted between 2009 and 2016 with long and short-sentenced (former) prisoners of three Nicaraguan prison facilities. This book is about the ways in which prisoners negotiate power both inside and outside their cells, documenting and theorizing the emergence of Nicaragua's hybrid carceral state.

In general, I am interested in the day-to-day workings of prison life and the (development) of carceral/penal states, policing and other forms of non-state/extralegal surveillance and governance. In doing so, I focus on questions of (il)legitimacy, violence and the body. I participate actively in a number of interdisciplinary networks on confinement and prisons research, including the Global Prisons Research Network (as a co-organizer), the EASA Anthropology of Confinement Network (co-convener 2018-2022), and the Americas Prisons Research Network/Red Penitenciaria de las Americas (founding member), with whom I organize various events.

Born in the US and currently living in the Netherlands, I'm a digital storyteller that's passionate about beautiful places and spaces. I love to create aesthetic content that captures the essence of my travels, and share stories and recommendations with my dedicated global audience of over 95,000.
I enjoy a wide variety of travel experiences, and use my content to encourage others to explore the world for themselves.

I've explored a number of places and professions in the years following my graduation from the University of Connecticut, where I graduated with a 3.53 GPA and two degrees in English and Psychology. I always knew I loved to write and that I was fascinated with the human mind, but I discovered another passion during my college years- traveling. In 2008 I made my first international trip count, and spent four months studying in Sydney, Australia. I developed an insatiable appetite for world travel that year, which might explain how I came to be where I am today- living abroad and discovering new places whenever I can!
 
In Bangkok, I was the Franchise Development Manager for Coldwell Banker Thailand, the first franchise office of the American real estate brand to come to Asia. In addition to finding potential franchisees in Thailand, I was the company’s social media manager. I wrote blog articles, photographed properties, and focused on creating an online presence in a country that is heavily centered around Facebook and Instagram. The role helped to refine my creative skills and ultimately led to a decision to pursue my interests independently. I currently manage a travel blog, girlgoneabroad.com and use my online influence and content creation skills to work with amazing brands in the travel niche.

Prior to founding BrandAide, Olga was Design and Brand Experience Leader for Procter & Gamble’s Global Prestige Beauty, Fragrances, and Hair Care portfolios. She was a driving, visionary force enabling growth for iconic beauty and luxury brands. 

Her most remarkable P&G legacy is her study of over 100 iconic brands, synthesizing the fundamentals of their success to apply these to turning brands around. Combining this with her expertise in cognitive science, she incorporated key drivers of human attention, memory, emotion, and decision-making into the brand portfolio.  

Olga's passion for capability-building led to the creation of P&G’s Eye On Beauty, a bespoke mobile app to elevate the beauty eye, mind, and craft of the organization.

After completing high school, I worked in the hospitality branch with Mise en Place. Here, I had the opportunity to attend international conferences and diplomatic events as a garcon. This further inspired me to join this community. 

Therefore, I opted for the program of European Studies at the The Hague University of Applied Sciences. This program is a wide-ranging course that provides students with the know-how to become European professionals. During this program, I gained skills ranging from political science to marketing. 
As an extracurricular activity, I joined the international organization of Enactus where I have developed a social enterprise that had the aim to empower women with a migrant background to improve the integration process as project leader. 

The program of European Studies has allowed me to conduct an with the University of Malta. This was the place where both my interest in the Mediterranean region and the values for the EU came together. Consequently, I decided to write my bachelor's thesis on the adherence to the EU’s Common Fundamental Values to protect the freedom of the press comparing Malta and Slovakia. 
After returning to The Hague, I decided to conduct my internship in Cyprus. The internship for DOREA Educational Institute allowed me to thoroughly analyze European policy together with the dynamics and needs of the European population. Based on this analysis I participated in developing training courses for DOREA. I am especially proud of the launch of the training course: “education for sustainable development” that I have developed from the early stages.

After graduating from The Hague University of Applied Sciences, I have decided to further develop my knowledge on the Mediterranean region starting the Master’s program of European Union and Human Rights Studies at the Catholic University of Murcia. The program connected me with peers from all continents discussing contemporary issues with highly skilled lecturers such as ambassador Javier Vallaure, Bichara Khader and director of Social Economy Europe, Víctor Meseguer. I have conducted an internship with Social Economy Europe where I have gained insight into the social economy and advocacy, as well as social media content creation and monitoring. Finally, I have utilized my passion for Europe by writing my final master’s thesis on the importance of European identity building by virtue of my participation in the Erasmus program."
