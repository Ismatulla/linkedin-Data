My PhD is almost finished. I will defend my PhD thesis on 23 September 2021. You can find more info here: https://www.rug.nl/news/2021/09/in-traffic-we-see-more-than-we-think

About me: Enthusiastic traffic psychologist who bridges the gap between science and practice. I am particularly interested in human factors and vehicle automation, ranging from assisted driving (ADAS) to automated driving and autonomous driving. I work on topics such as human machine interaction (HMI) and vehicle driving skill. Since 2021 I have the pleasure to work at RDW, the Dutch Vehicle Authority, as the lead on human factors and vehicle automation and to work closely together with the experts of CBR.
Previously I combined my work at the Dutch government with PhD research in the field of traffic psychology. I combine knowledge with a broad (inter)national network of human factors and traffic experts to obtain results and push forwards the safe deployment of smart mobility.

My PhD research is about information along familiar routes: on what we perceive and how this affects human behaviour. I have a specific interest in the detection of driving-related information and changes in this information, specifically concerning traffic management. If you are interested in my PhD work, you can find more info here: https://twitter.com/ilseharms/status/1438861650795405314?s=20.

Additionally, I am
- Alternate Director for the Netherlands at Euro NCAP
- Chair of the board of De VerkeersGedragDag, the leading national conference for professionals within traffic psychology - from knowledge institutes, market parties and governments - where we yearly share the state of the art in our field of work (www.devgd.nl),  
- peer reviewer for the scientific journal Transportation Research Part F, 
- a writer of scientific articles,
- sharer of research results with the general public through the media, including the NOS news on TV, radio shows on e.g. Radio538 and BNR, and various newspapers,
- and a lecturer on the full extent of traffic psychology through guest lectures and master classes for organisations and institutes such as DTV, PAO, NHL and HAN. 
The most important thing of knowledge is that is shared and applied!

She looks at the world and at organizations through the eyes of an anthropologist. Cultural anthropology is the discipline that asks what it means to be a human among humans in organisations and beyond. In 2012 she put Lewis method of Deep Democracy on the map in the Netherlands and she now works with a team of instructors to provide Deep Democracy training courses. She is always looking for ways to build strong tribes and reinforce the relationships between people. And then she brings that knowledge back to the world of organizing, cooperation and leadership through challenging keynotes and master classes. To improve the strength and results of individuals and groups (and to make the world a more beautiful place). She trains people, so that we never have to have meetings again. She takes you along in narratives that create space for new ways of seeing and new ways of dealing. Gradually, what is familiar becomes strange. And what is strange becomes familiar.

What others say about Jitske:
“Jitske Kramer is one of the best speakers of the Netherlands. She is energetic, sharp and connecting. She stimulates you to really think differently and to voice your thoughts and opinions. She talks with flair, humor and guts. Challenging the obvious. Asking questions. Seeking out for surprising new insights and practical applicability. Formal when needed, informal when possible. In short: Jitske rocks.”"

""Provide tailored mass spectrometry imaging solutions for product development purposes, in order to better understand product function and highlight important pathways of action.""

I established my start-up company, AKIN solutions, in order to pursue this goal.

Experience:

I successfully graduated my multidisciplinary PhD in 2018 which was focused on mass spectrometry imaging method development for analysis of advanced 3D cell culture models. Then I moved on to a role at the Leiden University Medical Center to establish tailored 3D cell culture and analytical protocols in order to address informational gaps in sarcoma research. This involved generation of patient-derived sarcoma models, the creation of suitable 3D cell culture methods within the group, and the adaptation of appropriate mass spectrometry imaging protocols for the analysis of these models. 

Funded by an EMBO fellowship I worked at the Center for Mass Spectrometry and Optical Spectroscopy (CeMOS) in Mannheim for four months (Jan-Apr 2022), in collaboration with the LUMC.

Over Tim:
Als Startup ondernemer heeft Tim verschillende bedrijven opgericht.
Het bedrijf Prindustry is vandaag de dag een marktleider in web2print software en Digital Asset Management. Tim stond aan de wieg van de webshop functionaliteiten en maakte de verbinding met de eerste 100 klanten. 

Bardoggy is een platform voor de horeca. In de tijd van lancering waren er apps als MyOrder, Scoopy en IENS die (met name gericht op restaurants) de verbinding maakte tussen bezoeker en locatie. Er was geen dominante speler specifiek voor de cafe horeca en de uitgaanssector.
Met funding (in totaal ca. 1miljoen), en een team is de MVP gelanceerd en groeide BarDoggy uit tot een app met voordeel coupons bij populaire uitgaanslocaties. Producenten sloten zich aan en konden kwalitatieve introducties van nieuwe producten aanbieden of juist bestaande producten een boost geven. 

Op het hoogtepunt zijn er 500 horeca locaties actief op BarDoggy en worden er wekelijks tienduizenden drankjes met de app aangeschaft.De conservatieve en traditionele houding van de sector maakt dat het lastig is om de meerwaarde van de consumentendata te kapitaliseren waardoor na 5 jaar een concreet verdienmodel uitblijft. De technologie is verkocht en het platform is in 2020 uit de lucht gehaald.

In commerciële rollen bij Print.com (250 FTE) en Lytho (40 FTE) is Tim verantwoordelijk voor de groei. Als teamspeler zoekt hij  graag de verbinding met collega’s om samen tot een mooi resultaat te komen. Hij geeft leiding op een mensgerichte manier en heeft focus op een goeie teamdynamiek. 

De heeft Tim ruim 50 bedrijven begeleid als startup en business coach. Daarnaast is hij spreker en geeft hij workshops over business-modelling en ScalingUp. Op strategische vlak is Tim betrokken bij talentontwikkeling, schaalbaarheid van Novel-T en de langetermijnvisie / strategie."

Amongst others, he created games in swimming pools, therapeutic sessions and forests. By creating games with professionals, students and non-game developers, Menno builds bridges between industries, disciplines and people. As a result, he fosters the inclusion of new perspectives and domains into the creative industry of game development.

Menno worked as incubation manager at Dutch Game Garden. He helped start-ups to enter the game industry or to search for new markets for their interactive experiences. Within a revamped incubation program, Menno brought start-ups together and had them learn from and with each other. In two years, the program has grown from zero to 40+ participants, all engaging and growing their businesses. 

Menno initiated the Games [4…] Jams. These game jams bring people together to develop a working game in a rather short time span. The jams produce case studies in the domains of inclusion, health, education and cultural heritage. Most of all, they inspire and connect. 

Together with Mark van Kuijk, Menno founded the game studio Lapp. Lapp develops prototypes and performs user tests for games that stimulate meaningful interactions between (grand)parents and children. Combining two playing styles and cognitive abilities in one game in order to resonate both experiences and invite players to communicate with one another.

As chairman of Games [4Diversity], Menno tries to improve the representation and inclusion of socio-cultural minorities in games. By organising gamejams, talks and informal mixers, he brings people together to inspire and connect on a rich variety of subjects. In line with this work, Menno organises the annual (Dutch) Courage showcases at GDC and Gamescom. He sets up industry meetings in Utrecht and  organised various conferences and summits. 

Currently, Menno works on games that fight cancer, artrose, loneliness and other (mental) health related subjects. All his work has one thing in common: connecting people in playful manners. "

Innovatie wordt niet gedreven door het feit of het technisch mogelijk is, maar of het waarde toevoegt voor de eindgebruikers. Kunnen en willen zij het gebruiken?

Innovatie in de zorg wordt nog te vaak ontwikkeld vanuit een ander perspectief. Kan de zorg efficiënter en goedkoper?

Mijn vrouw Hester, kreeg de diagnose Alzheimer toen ze 50 was en ruim 5 jaar later stierf ze aan de gevolgen ervan. Elke dag was ik getuige van haar oneerlijke strijd voor waardigheid en zelfredzaamheid. Als mantelzorger werd ik overbelast met het organiseren en regelen van de zorg. 

De zorg in Nederland is vastgeroest in hokjes en silo’s. Het systeem is kapot. Verandering is noodzakelijk en dan mogen we niet alleen naar anderen kijken. Wat is onze eigen rol hierin? Wat is de rol van de informele zorg in de wijk?

#focusopwatwelkan

Vanuit de praktijk zie ik kansen en mogelijkheden voor innovatie in de zorg die de positieve focus leggen op wat dus wél kan en daarin verbindend zijn. Ontwikkeld met en voor de mensen in de zorg.

Wereldwijd zijn er méér dan 60 miljoen mensen met dementie. Met mijn kennis en ervaring wijd ik mij volledig aan het welzijn voor mensen met dementie en de familie (mantelzorgers).

De juiste mindset, jezelf en je medewerkers continue ontwikkelen, veerkrachtig zijn. Zodat wanneer een crisis je raakt, je terug kunt veren, het roer om kunt gooien, jezelf kunt herpakken. Ik hou ervan om mensen in organisaties rondom deze onderwerpen te inspireren en adviseren. En met inbreng van mijn eigen ervaring maak ik het persoonlijk en toegankelijk.   

2020 zou voor mij het jaar zijn geweest dat alles goed zou komen. Na een dip in 2016 waarbij ik alles bijna kwijtraakte, was ik langzaam maar zeker aan het terugkrabbelen. Ik had begin 2020 alles eindelijk weer redelijk op een rijtje, er was weer een lichtpuntje aan de horizon. Ik had een goed lopend programma bij BNR en ik kreeg zowaar een hoofdrol in “Hello Dolly” de musical naast o.a. Simone Kleinsma, iets waar wel van heb durven dromen maar nu was het werkelijkheid.
En toen kwam waar daar opeens Covid-19 dat virus wat ver weg leek maar opeens aan een ieder zijn voordeur stond te bonken.
Binnen een tijdsbestek van een paar maanden verdwenen gegarandeerde opdrachten als sneeuw voor de lentezon. Waaronder ook het schitteren in een musical met Simone Kleinsma en Paul de Leeuw en nog vele andere theatercollega’s.
Gelukkig had ik 2 jaar daarvoor besloten dat het roer om moest. Ik wilde meer doen om bedrijven te helpen met de zelfontwikkeling van hun werknemers en ondernemers helpen met mindset sessies om veerkracht te ontwikkelen. Twee onderwerpen, waarin ik mezelf ervaringsdeskundige mag noemen.
 
Ik begon met het bijspijkeren van mijn kennis op het gebied van performance management en complexe ondernemings vraagstukken tijdens de crisis. Sinds 2019 ben ik Chief Inspirational Officer binnen Lenard and Lenard. Dit nadat ik eerst zelf een periode ben bijgestaan door hen om door mijn eigen storm te varen. 
Ik ben nu inzetbaar bij bedrijven om ze positief in beweging te krijgen en ze anders naar zichzelf maar ook naar de markt te kijken. Want een ding is zeker, Covid-19 is voor ons allemaal in welke vorm dan ook een  game changer. In mijn huidige rol probeer ik ondernemers en organisaties zoveel mogelijk te laten praten over hun uitdagingen maar ook over hun kansen die deze rare periode ook met zich meebrengt. 

Kortom, met de juiste mindset geloof ik niet alleen, maar weet ik zeker dat er heel veel mogelijk is. De kunst voor organisaties is een gezonde cultuur te creëren waarin mensen makkelijk tot een positieve mindset komen. Om te inspireren en geïnspireerd te worden nog betere resultaten te behalen.  "

I advise advertising and design companies on the topic of AI and its impact on our industry. I help them implement AI to gain extra creative leverage.

Currently I am testing OpenAI's Dall•E Experimental, which is still in alpha phase, as well as the multimodal version of ChatGPT, which will generate images too. Additionally, I’m affiliated with D-ID whom I've helped conceiving their Creative Reality Studio. With Arno Coenen I founded award winning AI-art collective CØ11@BorAi+oR⚡

For design- and ad-agencies I conceived creative campaign concepts, big and long strategically and technologically powered ideas. I spark creative processes with and within creative teams and I explore how disruptive tech - like Artificial Intelligence - augments creative professionals in their creativity, reach and effectiveness.

I conceived many on/ off/ through and beyond the line ad campaigns, which I helped materialise in any way. Whatever the medium, for whenever moment in whatever funnel (I prefer Google’s model though).

On the way to DALL•E 2's beta launch, I -as part of a small group of people- tested that AI for unwanted biases through creative experimentation, conceived new relevant product concepts inspired by the AI’s capabilities and helped OpenAI find high profile Dutch creative professionals as well as renowned Dutch artists to be DALL•E 2’s first artistic ambassadors.

After DALL•E 2 was made accessible to the public, also our research phase crew of creatives were allowed monetising our historically significant creative explorations. DALL•E's launch served as blueprint launching ChatGPT, sept. '22.

Today I am testing new DALL•E version V2.Experimental, ChatGPT Multimodal and its revolutionary Plugin Store. I also help other AI developing companies such as D-ID, advice on EU vs US privacy and IP-complexity and on how to responsibly and safely integrate AI effectively into workflows.

To do so, I connected dynamic energy budget models to size structured population models. I used this framework to study the effect density dependent growth in harvested North Sea fish stocks.

Dr. Natasja MS de Groot and Cardiothoracic surgeon Dr. Yannick J.H.J Taverne. The institute is a fusion of their research groups, which are respectively translational electrophysiology (department of Cardiology) and translational Cardiothoracic Surgery (department of Cardiothoracic Surgery). Within this institute  an network of medical doctors, engineers, biologist, patients and companies collaborate to implement innovation in biology, technology in daily clinical practice to diagnose and treat diseases caused by bio-electrical dysfunction with emphasis on the heart.
Bioelectronic medicine encompasses innovative approaches to detect and treat diseases by utilizing bioelectricity. Bioelectricity refers to generation of electrical currents by conversion of chemical energy produced by living organisms. Bioelectrical signals are at the heart of cell-cell communication and therefore essential for organization, morphogenesis, and regeneration of cells. Bioelectrical dysfunction causes dysfunctional organs and hence a variety of challenging diseases e.g. cardiovascular, neuromuscular-, skin- neurological-, auto-immune-, psychiatric-, metabolic- diseases and cancer. Deciphering bioelectricity and subsequently modulating it, revolutionizes prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment of these diseases. Recent molecular studies have highlighted the importance of bioelectrical signaling; the electrochemical nature of cells and their micro-environments encompasses a tight coupling between cellular physiology and bioelectricity. Combined with the realization that externally applied electrical fields can modulate multicellular processes, interest in bio-electricity of biological systems has been revived. The bioelectrical system is the quintessential link between form (morphology) and function (physiology) and is the gamechanger in translational research."

Today, I am training for a career in science and in my spare time I am a passionate advocate and volunteer for the cause of making medicines accessible and affordable for everyone around the world.

In 2021, I graduated cum laude and with Honours from an interdisciplinary Bachelor's programme combining biomedicine with public health and information.

Currently, I am in the second year of a Master's in ""Cancer, Stem Cells and Developmental Biology"". I have recently completed an internship at the Hubrecht Institute in the group of Wouter de Laat. Through this internship, I explored my interest in epigenetics, and in particular the effects of alterations in the 3D genome structure in cancer. Currently, I am looking for a final six month internship. After I graduate, I hope to continue a career in cancer research, contributing towards a better understanding of the molecular and (epi)genetic underpinnings of cancer, and by extension targets for improved treatments.

When I am not working or volunteering, I enjoy reading books, letting my creativity run free through writing short stories, as well as traveling and capturing memorable moments in photographs."

In my life and work I found out that it is satifying to always have a goal and some sort of challenge. So when a job is finished I will look for another task, no matter how big or small. I see a disappointment as a chance to learm something new. It keeps me flexible, awake and optimistic.

I am happy with my part-time job as a high school teacher biology. It appears to be fitting me and I love to work with so many people. As a hobby I work with horses, and sometimes other animals. I train my own Dartmoor pony in academic dressage, driving, and allround skills. I like to train people and animals. My dream is to do this at the same time.

Besides that I feel like a real scientist. I am especially interested in animal ethology (behaviour), anatomy, physiology, and parasitology. According to me spirituality and science can exist side by side, which will bring great things in the future. 

With my own bussiness Wonderpony, where I do horse and donkey worm egg counts in dung samples, I can perform the thouroughness and science skills I like to keep up. The advising of the horse owners and the networking is one of the advantages of this part-time job.

Nature simply fascinates me. I am outside as much as I can and I like to share that with others. I use intuition a lot while working with nature or animals. It has learned me so much in the past. 

I the future I would love to stay a teacher. I would like to combine that with biology or educational research, scientific research, or other activities. Like horseback riding, animal training and care/health, working outdoors or field work, lab work or anything like this. Any job that contains the elements of my passions is interesting for me."

My dream of becoming a scientist was shattered during my first internship. During those 6 months I came to the realization that there was no match between me and a life of pipettes, microscopes and cell cultures.

Harmonising science and society ideally yields more valuable scientific research as well as a faithful and supportive society.

I am very passionate about biology; specifically environmental biology, biodiversity, and sustainability. I am seeking opportunities to research and teach current environmental and biodiversity issues, and their solutions. 

I have lingered in the education system:

As a Biology bachelor graduate, I am capable of reading scientific literature, formulating my own research questions, creating my own research methods to establish a strong foundation for my own future research. Additionally, I can obtain my statistical results via Rstudio and am capable of presenting these results to many different audiences.   

As a student assistant, I am passionate about transferring my knowledge to other people and I can do this on an academic level. Even though Biology is very broad, I am capable of explaining subjects which are not my expertise. As I enjoy reading and learning about other fields in Biology like microbiology. 

As a tutor, I can change my approach when giving explanations at certain subjects or feedback, depending on what a certain student needs. I am also very capable of making timetables and can provide different ways of reading and studying strategies, which my students can try during study periods before tests."

My name is Jarco Smeenk and I try to spend as much time as possible with my two great passions: biology and travel. First of all, I am an experienced first-degree biology teacher with more than 17 years of experience, especially in the (pre-)exam classes of havo and vwo. I also try to reach as many students as possible via the digital way, which has resulted in the website Biologiepagina.nl. A hobby that got out of hand and has s grown into the largest free website of biology education in the Netherlands.

# The traveller
In addition to the biology website, I also made several online travel guides about my favorite destinations for a city trip. What started with a single travel blog Barcelonapagina.nl has now grown into the company Bio Web Design with a portfolio of 43 different online travel guides (full portfolio at https://rometips.nl/biowebdesign.html). The online travel guides are mainly focused on cities in Spain and Italy and active in several languages. Now, the travel portfolio has a monthly reach of 1.5 million page views, which has enabled me to make travel my work.

What am I looking for?
Sitting still is not one of my qualites, which is why you can always approach me for:
- A new (part-time) challenge in biology education focussed at exam students.
- Travel collaborations: from new content to affiliate opportunities, especially for cities in Spain and Italy"

Background
Matteo was born Como (Italy) in May 1989 and studied Physics at Insubria University, graduating cum laude in March 2014. In those years, he gained interest in experimental Physics, with a predilection for particle detectors. Following this interest, he had the opportunity to perform profilometry measurements of an anti-proton beam and measure the diameter of the Sun with a pixelated silicon detector and develop a detector for spectral measurements of neutrons produced by an in-hospital linear accelerator.
After getting in touch with the hospital environment and feeling the need to broaden his horizons, he decided to step into the field of medical imaging, where, by chance, detectors are somehow involved. From May 2014 to May 2018, he was enrolled as a PhD candidate at the Radiotherapy Department of the Universitair Medisch Centrum Utrecht (The Netherlands). During his PhD project, he had the luck to discover the beauty of magnetic resonance imaging in the practical realm of radiotherapy.
Since 2018, Matteo has been a Postdoc dedicating his efforts to translate deep learning for adaptive radiotherapy clinically. Since January 2022, he has been appointed assistant professor, gaining the opportunity to facilitate clinical translation further and keeping an eye on cutting-edge software and its integration and development in the healthcare continuum.

Regarding my studies, during MSc studies, I followed a course for unconventional geo-resources which made me motivated to pursue a career in this field. For that reason, I am looking actively for full-time job opportunities in the sector of Energy as Geologist/ Geophysicist and optimally in Geothermal and Oil and Gas Exploration, or CO2 storage.

My thesis project was on researching Intra-oceanic subduction initiation with analogue modeling techniques which provided with important scientific and technical skills such as the use of laboratory equipment, process, analysis, documentation and interpretation of results with computer software. Subsequently, I started a research project on the exploration of Geothermal resource potential in mainland Greece developing a numerical model of the thermal structure of the Greek lithosphere. This was achieved by modelling the 3D geological structure of the area and use it as input for the thermal model.  During this project, I familiarized myself with the use of two different numerical modelling software. 

During my Bachelor in Geology department at the University of Athens, I did an Internship at the National Observatory of Athens having the opportunity to get an insight into how geological research in the field of Tectonics and Geodynamics works. Furthermore, I have worked along with Corinth Rift Laboratory (CRL) team for 2 years after Bachelor graduation, contributing to several field expeditions in North Peloponnese, Greece for GPS and Seismic data acquisition   

I describe myself as a committed and highly motivated scientist. Being curious, competitive, independent and seeking to expand my knowledge and skills are a few of my natural traits. I have good Fieldwork skills mainly obtained from the geological mapping of an area in Southern Greece as part of my BSc Thesis as well as spending 4 weeks in Spain collecting data for investigating the tectonic history and Inversion of Sorbas Basin in Almeria in June 2018 as part of one of my MSc courses. Throughout these projects, I learned to make meaningful interpretations of geological structures in the field and also of microstructures of rock samples to infer the deformation history of an area.

I wanted to be a scientist when I was a little kid and I studied geology in university. But now I’m providing business insights and building data infrastructure. So what happened?

Well, as I finished up my studies, I did some thinking about what I wanted out of my career. I realized that despite my love for geology, I didn’t want to be a geologist forever. But I did want to do something with business (and definitely entrepreneurship at some point).

It was also at this time that I learned about data analytics as a career. I immediately saw similarities between what I love about geology research and the job of a data analyst. As I’ve gained experience as an analyst, I’ve only found more similarities. For both it boils down to processing a complex dataset and telling a story that is meaningful to the target audience. Simplifying complexity. 

For example, in my geologic research I collected atomic data from individual, microscopic mineral grains and published new insights on millions of years of history of an entire mountain range. In my current role, I dug into the transactions of individual customers to gain insights on churn and developed a model to identify it as soon as it’s detectable (and increased customer winbacks in the process). For both of these projects I took complex and minute details and turned them into useful knowledge. 

A related term I like is “lumpers and splitters”, coined by Charles Darwin (himself a geologist better known for his other work). The gist of the term is that some people split every detail into its own category, whereas others lump things to focus on the broader story. Both of these are valid ways of looking at the world, but context drives whether you present the lumped or the split view to your audience.

Taking notes in the field, I may call a rock a quartzofeldspathic gneiss, but when shopping for countertops I’ll ask the salesperson for the granite section. 

I see the ability to lump complex data together as a key component of being a good analyst. You need to be able to understand and work with all of the details, but aggregate and relay only the key information that can be acted upon. 

Ultimately, I see my job as taking something complex and making it understandable and actionable. Simplifying complexity. 

So whether you need to learn how a mountain formed or why success early in the sales pipeline isn’t leading to expected revenue, I’m your guy. Also, I’ll be happy to tell you some interesting facts about the countertop in the cafeteria if you ask."

His career has been on the interface of geology/mining and project management. He supports the philosophy that complex subsurface projects, with many stakeholders and risks, may only be a success when (technically) managed by a project manager with a solid knowledge of the subsurface and uncertainties, risks and controversies this brings along.

Tjeerd studied geology in Utrecht at the Faculty of Earth Sciences (MSc degree 1999) and completed two post-graduate courses in business administration (2000-2002). In mid-2001 he started his professional geological career at the Dutch Directorate-General of Public Works and Water Management (Rijkswaterstaat) in Delft as project manager raw materials supply. In 2004 he switched to the consultancy firm MWH (formerly Syncera; now part of Stantec) in Zwolle and Arnhem as project manager for sustainable use of the subsurface. In 2009 he became Technical Leader for geology and subsurface and senior project manager. In the meantime, he has obtained several project management certificates (IPMA C / D). 

In September 2012, Tjeerd joined the Mining Department of AkzoNobel Industrial Chemicals (now Nouryon) as a Geologist / Project Manager. In addition to providing internal salt geological advice, he has led complex projects in the field of storage in salt caverns (gas oil, gases and compressed air) and well integrity. In August 2017, as Manager Mining Projects, Tjeerd became responsible for all mining projects in AkzoNobel's cavern fields in Denmark and the Netherlands. After the split off of AkzoNobel's Specialty Chemicals division in October 2018 to become Nouryon, and following an internal reorganization at the end of 2018, his job changed to Lead Expert Mining Projects in November 2019, providing geological and mining technology support in several cavern storage projects.
In July 2020 Tjeerd decided to leave Nouryon to continue his career elsewhere, focusing on storage of energy (compressed air and hydrogen) in salt caverns and in October of the same year Tjheerd started his own company Mole Underground, offering geological and mining technology project management and consultancy services. In this way he wants to contribute to the energy transition.

My research in Mexico was a wonderful experience. Not only did it teach me invaluable lessons about science, but it also allowed me to explore my own personality and grow as a person.

Thousands, hundreds, millions, billions of light years away, there's nothing like it, nothing that able to bear us.  We were born here. It enclosed us in itself and merged into one with its and our history for many thousands of years. It helped us invent art, ancient and modern architecture. It gave us resources. It has led our world into what we see now, cutting out layer by layer, immortalizing it with decorations in the form of sacred temples and majestic buildings.
The Earth delights and inspires.  It's so different. Cold and hard to reach at the poles. Hot and capricious in tropical zones. And so sensitive in the heart of the equator. It showed us the stars and plunged us to the bottom of the ocean. Its gave us the opportunity to learn about it and to know it. Its gigantism in the mountains overwhelms my heart. The amount of its biodiversity ignites my gaze. At the boundaries of the lithospheric plates, collisions frighten and eruptions kill. 
But we don’t appreciate it. It’s dying. The only one. We polluted its beauty with garbage and noxious gases and slowly but surely destroyed its fragile natural uniqueness that gave us moments of life on the timeline.  For centuries, we have stuck knives full of gunpowder in it and tortured to possess it.
And now, in order not to become one of the extinct fossil forms that define a particular geological period, there is an extraordinary need to regulate the use of land resources and human ambitions.
These thoughts defined my future professional scientific interest - geology."

Since 2005 we do fully pitch on morgages with the filosofy that we only want happy clients, happy clients bring you more clients. The best advertisement is a real testimonial. Word to mouth.  In this period most of the competitors wanted to make as much money as possible, a happy client was not heard about.

Since we do have low overhead costs we do not need to sell any nonsense products. Thats the key of todays succes

This research continued to fascinate me. 

After that I started working at the AAC/Projectenbureau, the archaeological research office of the UvA. The close relations between research, education and the archaeological practice I found particular appealing. The opportunity I got to put the lessons learned to practice were especially valuable and resulted i.a. therein that I won the SIKB trophy for ‘Best Research Design Brief’.

When in 2011 the AAC/Projectenbureau passed into Diachron UvA bv, I saw opportunities to build a new business. As a senior KNA-archaeologist I have been working as a project manager for the Southern Netherlands. A lot of energy I got from the challenge to connect our services to the needs of our clients; to let archaeological research not only be of value to the scientific community, but also to provide added value beyond. The close cooperation with our customers I found very rewarding. That delivering customized solutions can provide new opportunities as well proved our research on the agricultural landscape of Veldhoven, for which I was awarded the ‘Grand Prize of the Dutch Field Archaeology’.

At the start of the 2015 it was time for a reorientation. I then started as a research associate at the UvA for a study on ‘Village formation in the Middle Ages’, a project by the Cultural Heritage Agency. Somewhat sooner than planned, I also started working as a freelance researcher with my own company: Creative Archaeology. As such I support my clients in research on rural communities during the Late Middle Ages and early Modern Period. This research also forms the subject of my doctoral research which I recently started at the University of West Bohemia. This combination of project (field)work, synthesizing research and an in-depth study allows me to develop myself further along this theme in the coming period.

Born in the Netherlands, Geert Lemmers studied photography and photographic Art and worked as a freelancer for magazines and fashion artists before focusing on his artistic career in 2008, winning the same year the professional art-prize in his region.
My ideas and statements about ART: 
I think that art gives us back to ourselves in a renewed state. 
By paying attention to art for a moment, we tap into a source within ourselves and we gain access to the imagination. 
Art offers us new perspectives, makes us think and activates our senses. Art gives us value so that we feel we can be different from what we tend to think. 
She teaches us how we can free ourselves from our regular pattern, rise above ourselves and open ourselves to other people, to the world. 

« Composing artworks for me almost is a philosophic question in transferring my thoughts into metaphorical representations. » 
Geert Lemmers is a prizewinning artist from the Netherlands whose works have been featured in shows internationally. Working across painting, photography and new media, Lemmers is inspired by philosophical questions and creates digitally altered images and abstract paintings that reveal hidden worlds. His work is characterized by enlarged characters in chaos, beauty, and imperfection."

Joos van Barneveld, better known as DOES, was born in Veghel, The Netherlands, in 1982. His prime passion was football and he trained and played as a professional player for football club Fortuna Sittard from the age of 9. In 1997 he discovered graffiti, a passion that coerced him into a double life. For more than a decade he was forced to combine the daily needs of a professional athlete with the night-time secrets of a graffiti writer. In 2010 a knee injury forced him to give up his career as a football player and rethink his future.
 
Where many would have experienced a drama, DOES saw the possibility to exclusively devote himself to art, developing his practice and carrying his craftsmanship to a higher level with the same dedication, focus and self-restraint that soccer taught him. Through the years, both as an artist and as a member of the LoveLetters graffiti collective, his style, which is today highly recognizable, has become a mix of influences from old-school writers and his own research. In his drawings and paintings you can discover the roots of 3D lettering, but you can also be surprised by his patient research of well balanced color schemes and his capacity of controlling the purity of outlines. As Phase 2 wrote in his Style Writing from the Underground manifesto in 1996: “Writing is centered on names, words and letters. Combined with the objective of their execution, this creates the product and the overall make up of the writer”. DOES perfectly understood this process and calmly researched his own style, which can be seen as a kind of controlled dripping. His letters, with their dizzying colour schemes, are stretched so much that they seem to release their energy and spread drips all over the wall.
 
While many recognize him as an ultra-talented draftsman and an amazing colourist, DOES is today moving the boundaries of his own artistic research in new conceptual directions, looking at graffiti as an archive from which he can physically pull out samples that embody his own roots. He drills or peels off walls covered with spray paint to include these artefacts into sculptures made of plaster. He develops a kind of contemporary archeology of urban spaces, keeping a trace of the geographical coordinates of these walls, readapting the tools of a science that normally deals with past times to underline his own story and the impact of graffiti culture on our society.

During my MA, I specialized in the collective remembrance of conflicts, resulting in my Thesis on the collective memories on different aspects of the Dutch colonial period, as well as the fall of Srebrenica, and how these memories are created and shaped by the wording and images used in history textbooks. 

My education has given me the opportunity to conduct research on a broad range of topics, from archival research on collectors of non-Western art in the 1970's to the use of precolonial heritage in peace museums in Kenya, and from tiled walls in Catholic churches to the roles played by Mennonites in WWII. The one thing in common: all of these subjects deal with how history is 'created' in one way or another. Often the stories and created histories are at least as important as what actually happened in history, at least when looking at society. 

Apart from my research qualifications, I also have experience in organizing events, coordinating small teams of volunteers, and presenting for/entertaining children and young adults."

My BA thesis consisted of the development of a cumulative viewshed analysis within GIS. My ambition for further development and gathering of these skillsets brought me to Sweden were I followed a two year Master program. Within this program I was further taught in the use of GIS and 3D modelling tools, worked with different kind of laser scanners, satellite data and frequently with image-based modelling. A combination of (most of) the above mentioned techniques and methods form the foundation of my MA thesis, in which I researched how to increase the transparency of conduct of digital archaeological 3D reconstructions within the boundaries of a 3D GIS environment.

I met my husband at the introductory lecture of our professor.  In Amsterdam I studied South and Southeast Asian history and archeology focusing on the Khmer Empire. The study I completed was in both Ancient and modern history of SEAsia from the University of Leiden.
There was no work in the ‘80s for an inexperienced archeologist, so I decided to train as an EFL teacher of adults, getting an RSA- TEFL diploma in 1985.  Through the eighties and nineties we travelled and worked in various countries including a stint in the PRC (just after Tianamien) teaching future teachers of English at a ‘third rate’ teachers’ college in Xian. Also I worked at the language centre of a university in Hong Kong and as lecturer of academic writing in a small university in the north of Lebanon.
Teaching adults of all professions from Cape Verdean sailors in Rotterdam to Deutsche Bank staff in Dusseldorf ensured that I was flexible both in teaching an in design of learning trajectories in non-academic settings. Somewhere in all this time, I started doing a Masters in Adult Education from the OUUK while working full time. This was triggered by a growing fascination with the various ways that people learn.
More and more I wanted to understand how to design and deliver learning opportunities for adults. This was the core aim of research carried out in the later years of my working life.

Between 1979 and 1981 I worked in the cardiology department in the Binnen Gasthuis. In June 1981 we moved to the new Academic Medical Center. I worked there at the department of Cardiology, where I fulfilled many different roles, from chief of the Coronary Care Unit,chief of the Emergency Cardiac Care unit,  chief of the Catheterization laboratory and supervisor of the consultation service. I followed training and practiced intervention cardiology and implantation of cardiac devices (pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, ICD's).
At the same time my research focussed on emergency cardiac care: prevention of ventricular fibrillation by anti arrhythmic drugs (the subject of my PhD thesis). After that my research centered on management of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). A registry started in 1995 which has recorded and analyses OHCA on an intense and uninterrupted basis since 2005: the ARREST (AmsteRdam REsuscitation STudies) study. A large intervention study of benefit of automated external defibrillators (AED's) was performed between 2000 and 2002. Ever since, I promoted and followed the introduction of AEDs, which was very successful. Introduction first was with police and fire fighters first responders, since 2009 also intensely in residential communities.
Our research group continuously engages in new research projects on OHCA. In association with Hanno Tan MD, PhD as co-PI (who received funding from the EU Horizon 2020 program with the program Escape-NET) and Marieke Blom, PhD as senior researcher there are now 7 PhD students and 5 data managers active in the ARREST group. 
I retired from the cardiology practice in 2014 but since then dedicate much of my time to the study of OHCA through the ARREST study, which I hope to continue several years to come."

My daily delight is to unravel pathophysiological mechanisms of diseases from a molecular perspective that is purely informed by biological data and clinical evidence. As such, unveiling actionable diagnostics and therapeutic biomarkers, and deciphering drug side-effects from targeted molecular pathways is my call. 
I have both clinical and scientific work experience and am richly equipped with knowledge from the life sciences; the only way to make precision medicine, really precise. 

My first break from academics was to the clinic, where I put my knowledge in biochemistry, microbiology, parasitology, immunology and hematology, among others into practice, including direct interactions with patients. My second break from academics was to industry (bioinformatics, functional genomics, human genetics, drug testing, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, biostatistics, epidemiology and cardiology) in order to study the workflow and landscape of clinical trials, and squarely test the central dogma in systems biology. I enjoy working at the interface of science and the clinic, ensuring information fluxes to both directions by collaborating with both clinicians and scientists. I cherish international collaborations. 

In a little while, I'll be open for academic (professorship) positions in molecular cardiology and infection where I could provide scientific research support ( molecular mechanism of diseases, bioinformatics, biostatistics, grants and industrial liaison) and continue to supervise medical students on their BSc, MSc and PhD projects.

For this purpose, I adopt novel imaging approaches to assess the effects of exercise training on micro and macrovessel function and structure, and explore factors that moderate these effects (e.g. older age). These benefits of exercise training on the arterial wall may contribute to the reduction in cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, my work has strongly focused on understanding (hemodynamic) stimuli, such as shear stress and arterial pressure, to mediate the effects of exercise training on the vasculature. In my work I encompasses the lifespan; from exercise training in the prevention of the development of atherosclerosis in obese children and adolescents, to research on the best combination of exercise and (non)pharmacological strategies in the management of patients with cardiovascular risk and/or disease.

After his Gymnasium diploma from the St. Bonifatius College in Utrecht in 1995, he traded Dutch soil for a horizon-broadening year of undergraduate study at Wittenberg University, in Springfield, Ohio, USA. He was inspired to study Biomedical Science, and enrolled in 1996 at the Leiden University. In the same year he joined the Leiden Student Union Minerva. However, the idea of interaction with patients appealed to him so much, that after finishing his freshmen year he started studying Medicine. After a successful first year, he joined the “Joshua’s”, a group of students, involved in post-operative patient care at the thoracic intensive care unit of the Leiden University Hospital. His first scientific research project was a spin-off of this work, and inspired him to persevere in research in parallel to his clinical work. He finished his clinical studies with an internship at the department of Cardiology at the Leiden University Medical Center. After his medical degree in 2004 he started his PhD-research in January 2005 at this same department under supervision of Dr. H.W. Vliegen, Professor M.J. Schalij and Professor E.E. van der Wall. During the following three years and three months, of which the thesis ""non-invasive diagnosis and follow-up of right ventricular overload"" is the result, he has worked hard to setup the multidisciplinary Leiden University Medical Center “pulmonary hypertension working group”. Regarding the pulmonary hypertension research he has worked in close cooperation with Dr. A. Vonk Noordegraaf, Dr. A. Boonstra, and K.T.B. Mouchaers of the VU University Medical Center. Since July 1st 2014 he is active as a Cardiologist, currently in the Bravis hospital in Roosendaal/Bergen op Zoom, with special attention for transthoracic echocardiography (ESC certified 2014) and cardiac device therapy (EHRA exam 2013)."

I took a Journey through art and expression and am finally ready to share it with the world. I radically changed careers and started living from my heart.
Allow me to reintroduce myself:
My values Empowerment, Truthfulness, and Innovation are reflected in everything I do.

The Culture
One of my life goals is to awaken people through my projects, productions, art and books. 
I want to do more than just inspire and educate, I want to elevate the entire culture.
I am humbly on the forefront of the Afrofuturism Movement in Europe, touring major museums and venues across Europe, promoting the culture, artists and history with my media productions & virtual art expos.
One of my latest creations is a unique universe of sci-fi, adventure, history, magical realism, African and world mythology that I express through literature, animation, creative technology, and music.

The Institute
I co-founded First Noble, Europe’s first institute for World History and Afro-Caribbean Arts & Culture, where like-minded artists, creators, and students come together to create. It is a platform and stepping stone allowing them to connect and grow within an international community. Using my experience and expertise, I also advise and guide underprivileged and upcoming artists. Helping others to succeed is a crucial pillar in everything I do. 

The Book
My first book, HIS STORY OF THE WORLD, L’ HISTOIRE DU MONDE  is a vortex into an exciting and new multiverse where african legends and mythology meets reality. Travelling through time and space, you will find ancient civilizations, people with magical powers and discover the true origin of myths and legends. You will learn about events that shaped our reality and the world as we know it. It bears ancient knowledge and a hidden truth about our human history.
After reading this book, which is Part One of a series, you will never look at our world and the universe the same again.

I am available for speaking engagements, book readings and signings. 
Feel free to contact me for talks or collabs on: Creative technology (VR, Motion capturing and animation), Afrofuturism, Performing Arts, Media, Digital Art, Afro Caribbean Heritage & Mythology and Youth Culture.

In de zakelijke werkomgeving past deze beschrijving goed bij mij: Marlies kan goed prioriteiten stellen en snel beslissingen nemen. Dit helpt haar effectief en resultaatgericht te werken. Doordat zij vriendelijk en communicatief vaardig is en een open en positieve houding heeft, weet zij mensen te motiveren. Het krijgen van feedback is voor haar een belangrijke motivator. Door op een zakelijke, commerciële en collegiale manier te werken, wordt zij vaak benaderd als mensen een sparringpartner nodig hebben.

His work ensures that your mind does not immediately see through the struggle and violence in the image, but that you use your imagination to fathom it. ""In my work I explore the violence and ideas of attackers. In many cases there is hardly any contradiction between reasonable thinking and evil. Reason is an instrument that can be used for good and for evil. Thinking too can easily turn from good to evil. ""
.
What does struggle mean for Patrick? ""Studying evil and violence has always been a field of the arts. Think of Francisco Goya's painting 'Saturn that swallows up his children', Dantes Hell, Medea from Greek mythology, Van den Vos Reynaerde, Macbeth, The Joker or Hanibal Lecter. It stiltens our fascination with violence, our desire to witness the cross-border, the covert, the forbidden, the gruesome. Art can produce an interval between seeing and understanding, creating a question mark in the midst of the flood of images. Creating a sort of space so that the thinking no longer reproduces the already established opinions and new thoughts can start. To release such an intermediate area, the artist will have to undermine the stereotyped images and thought patterns. Sand in the representation machine so that it falters and jerks and no longer conjures up the calibrated image. None of the contradictions with which we have classified our world is still to be trusted. The beauty no longer belongs to the good, the ugly no longer automatically to evil. """

As a kid, I loved leafing through my Dad’s outdoor sports catalogs. I was fascinated by how brands used storytelling through beautiful images and captivating copy. It felt more like reading a storybook that let my imagination run wild, rather than looking at ads. 

And, I thought;
Someday, I want to create something like this. Stories that inspire people. 🌌 

Right after I graduated high school, I packed my bags and left my little hometown in Austria to move to the US for a year. ✈️ My fascination with storytelling never left me, so I packed my bags again to move straight to the Netherlands to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Creative Business (class of ‘22🎓)

Since then, I have:

📚 Started to dive deeper into my passion for psychology, strategy, and creative thinking - using my knowledge and skills to manage social media channels, create content strategies, and lead creative projects at different companies.

✨ Discovered my entrepreneurial spirit - worked on my start-up idea, pitched it to different audiences, and got a glimpse of the innovative, fast-paced start-up world (failed and learned a lot in the process).

🤓 Started to embrace my curiosity - my yearly book count is starting to catch up with Bill Gates’, and now I occasionally geek out on Neuroscience and Greek Mythology. #nevernotlearning

Since I was a little child I made drawings and I painted. Art has always been a passion. In my work I am using my imagination, my fantasy. This is my unique and own signature. I seek the beauty in people and not the ugliness. For me creating works of art is a form of love and that is wonderful.
I was trained and graduated as a fashion designer in Amsterdam and worked a couple of years in the fashion industry as a designer, but I preferred to be an art painter. I followed art classes at De Gooise Academie in Laren, The Netherlands. Meanwhile I worked as a technical designer, a did public relations for a bank and worked as a secretary and managing assistent. Furthermore I did (and still do) a lot of self study about acrylic and oilpainting with special interest in the old techniques from and recipes of the old masters. Now, for many years already, I give art classes myself.

“Rineke de Jong’s paintings are a fusion of pure painting and concrete figuration. The abstract phase is, purely intuitive, often painted hastily, resulting in a chaotic and evocative space. Figures arise amongst the chaos of color, which makes her painting complete. Her quest is exploring the compromise between abstract and figurative art. She also works in the old academic art of oilpainting.
Mythology is often the source of inspiration. She tries to achieve divinity and humanity in her paintings.
Rineke de Jong has often exhibitions in The Netherlands and abroad, such as in France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Denmark, etc., and won many awards. She was invited and was present with her works of art at the Florence Biennale 2009.”"

She received her art education at the Academy of Arts in Yerevan, Armenia. 

Painting 
Her powerful artwork contains many classic and mythic themes and some features of traditional symbolism. In her separate paintings the effect of her powerful use of colors changes, but is harmonious and challenging each and every time, sometimes even on the edge of psychedelics. Sometimes they do, therefore, remind us of the flower power movement of the sixties. 
However, they also contain many parallels with the romantic works of Symbolist artists of the fin de siècle, such as the Dutch painter Toorop and the Russian born Kandinsky. By the way, she herself said to have been influenced by the Jugendstylartists Gustav Klimt and Antoni Gaudí, which is no surprise once one has seen her work. Her preference for decorative ornaments and symbols seem to have been rooted in her younger years. She used to wove rugs and tapestries and make collages when she was younger. No wonder that the continuous alternation of contrasting colors and patterns have inspired the baroque and decorative aspect that characterizes her work today.

Graphic work 
In addition to her paintings, she also makes pen drawings and watercolors, or a combination of those two. Her graphic work is very detailed, colorful, graceful and magical, and clearly inspired by fashion, clothing and jewelry design. More specific, the elegant female figures from the fin-de-siècle, and rich ornamental art and craft patterns from the Caucasus and other ethnic art, such as the Slavic folklore and mythology, French pointillism, Armenian / Mediterranean miniatures, Indonesian batik, Japanese and Egyptian papyri ukiyos do belong to her references.

London May 16-18 2012

If you want to view my paintings at this Art Fair then please inform me.

Parallax Art Fair (Londen, UK)
Parallax AF grew out of an international exhibition called “Parallax” that was conceived and curated by the art historian and theorist Dr Chris Barlow.
Parallax AF is different from other artists’ fairs in that it is like a specialised exhibition.
It is a serious platform for international and national artists to present their work to national and international dealers, art industry people, collectors, critics and buyers without commission charges.


John Haanstra offers selective collections of original paintings to art lovers and art buyers. At his website you can mainly see artworks which fall in the category of surrealism. Besides surrealism there are also paintings available in the category of impressionism. 

He started his journey by applying elements of Greek mythology and surrealism. Central in this collection (Connecting Time) is the use of surrealistic factors. He advanced his way through the elements of fantastic realism and magic realism shown in the second collection (Circle of Tales) and the third collection (City Life). The latest works partly step away from the ""magic surrealistic world"" into a more impressionistic world. 

In spite of the application of several art styles in his collections, John Haanstra follows a clear line with his artworks. The paintings of John Haanstra can be recognized by settings in which everything is in balance. He combines various elements into his paintings to portray the stories behind the works. In fact, it can be said that John Haanstra directs with paint. 

Paintings can be bought by contacting the artist by phone or mail. It will be appreciated if Art lovers leave there feedback by mail. These modern oil paintings can be seen in my atelier in the Netherlands. Watch the collections of surrealism and impressionism and enjoy my Gallery!

Specialties: These artworks are painted with oil paint on canvas using fine brush strokes. This method of painting requires a highly skilled technique and a particular feeling for composition. Several old and new painting techniques are used to create these paintings. These qualities make John Haanstra's paintings particularly unique."

""My main concern is: What role does the imagery play in today’s society, and how do we relate to it? In my artistic work I constantly analyze what it means to be human and where the medium of photography acts as a station of the imaginary feeding sapient reality. Despite our never-ending technological advances and evolution of understanding, the core of what it means to be human remains in absolute stasis manifested in an ingenuous state of wonder.""

	.. an entrepreneurial attitude: Always exploring new industries and building innovative programs from scratch, uncovering new perspectives and turning them into tangible results,

	.. people skills; Developing formal and informal teams, leading them through deep listening, empowerment and most of all love. Never shying away from the questions that need to be asked.

As an expedition leader I am intrigued by the issues that truly matter. Where do you/ your company want or need to go? And why, why you, and why now or why not? To answer these strategic questions we’ll build a team that’s brave enough to go out there and explore. That will find you the answers you need, through experiments and validated learning, through personal development and the power of stories on how they got there in the first place. Always operating on the border of various systems or worlds, as that’s the place where radical innovation can happen. I love to work with multi-nationals, start-ups and non-profits simultaneously, creating unexpected alliances when of value. Especially interested in the development of sustainable new business models, building of unholy alliances, and the unleashing of talent. Areas of expertise: sustainability, systems innovation, leadership development, and creation of (mass) movements.

This audience includes myself, for I am never done improving. Ongoing personal reconstruction is key.

That last part is a bit of a personal quest, fueled by the art form known as cinema. Because, as great filmmaker Christopher Boe once put it: “Cinema is a wonderful medium to get to know life. It's sort of a backstage pass into life where we can experience things before we experience them in real life.” As Boe's masterpiece Reconstruction shows us: in film we can reconstruct life and it's problems and learn from the consequences characters face based on their actions.

I thought making movies, or writing about them firsthand, wouldn't be possible. So much has already been said, sung or shown by great artists like Boe, that I'm not sure I would become anything more than just another voice lost in the white noise that is our current media landscape. Working for Ximon and Cinetree, who distributed less known but far more interesting content, enabled me to try and make sure that wouldn't happen to others.

Still, over the years, I gradually shifted back to production and in 2015 I founded Sure Thing Video. After some time freelancing, in 2019 I joined Yelow Jersey, my biggest client, as a Senior Content Creator. Just before all hell broke loose. 

It's my goal to become a fully capable video editor and color grader and i've also been one-man-banding ever-expanding rigs with Blackmagic and Z Cam cinema camera's at their core.

Helping people often starts with providing them with the right information. This has caused my love for education. During my bachelor, I helped secondary school students decide on a bachelor programme by educating them about their options and about student life in general. Furthermore, I have enjoyed working at ‘De Ontdekfabriek’ (discovery factory), where I gave multiple workshops and explained the mechanisms behind them.

In my spare time, I enjoying playing board games or solving escape rooms. I always go all in, so I also participate in national championships related to these hobbies.

You can find a selection of things I've done in my (semi-)professional life below. But more importantly I like to share what I enjoy doing.

After working in sustainability consulting, startups and web development, I decided to canoe in the Amazon. This kind of worked out and it became quite a longer journey and adventure then planned. Jungle areas, plants and ecosystems grasped my attention as well as how our relation is to nature.

Health of our natural environments, traditional ways and our personal health always interested me, but it became much more after traveling and living in permaculture communities.

This led me to a new project: Pure Kakaw sparked from the fascination of how cacao was used traditionally and the benefits it has for our body & mind. Nature is an incredible source for learning, to increase our potential and live healthily.

It is a true joy to work directly with farmers in different places in Central & South America. To source a fair and healthy product, and to support agroforestry farming and planting more trees.


Some other fields of interest:
- Meditation
- Permaculture
- Mycology
- Cacao
- Regenerative Agroforestry"

I touch the sound with my bare hands and turn it into an earworm. I am the goosebumps on your arm. I am the memories and feelings. I am the absolute connection between sound and visual content.

Nothing extraordinary, just my usual pipeline as the founder and creative director of WAVEME.PRO LLC Creative Audio Lab - an award-winning studio that has composed music and sound design for almost every A-list brand around the world, including Mercedes-Benz, Microsoft, BMW, HP, Unilever, Porsche, Jaguar, Apple, Toyota, Genesis, etc.

I've been responsible for music and sound for projects such as EXPO 2020 in Dubai, an immersive installation at Microsoft EBC in Redmond, the Nexus Arabia opening show in Riyadh, the Mercedes-Benz AMG GT launch in Beijing, the History Hall Museum in Montreal, the BMW 5-Series launch in Jakarta, the Jaguar Racing Formula season launches in London and many others. 

 My 10+ years of experience as a sound producer inevitably led me to see, imagine and feel the sound. If I hear music - I automatically separate instruments, looking for hooks and details, and explore harmony and melodic patterns. I take sounds in the street by default as the noise painting that defines my existence. One day, I stopped resisting it, deciding to use this gift for the benefit of all life in our galaxy. 

Inspired by the research work of Prof. Marcel Cobussen and Prof. Hafez Ismaïli M'Hamdi of Leiden University, a neurobiologist Prof. Dale Purves of Duke University, and Dr. James Humberstone of The University of Sydney, I started my own research activity. I began to study how audio content affects the emotional construct of the human brain. I immersed myself in a brand new direction of applied psychology. It is based on the theory of parallels and the evolutionary response of human genetic stages to specific rhythmic and melodic patterns. 

Later I started exploring the possibilities of AI in audio production and launched two startups aimed at simplifying the work of the sound designer and composer. 

My background as a spacecraft engineer combined with my musical education and experience as a light artist gave me the opportunity to look at multimedia storytelling from both a technical and an artistic perspective. My move to Dubai has transformed these components into a single vector - a mission of creating a magnificent future around the world using all my skills and talents.

This magazine was founded in 1866 as a platform for intelligent discussion and debate. Contributors were, amongst others, W.E. Gladstone, J.M. Barrie and Aldous Huxley. In 1956 Contemporary Review acquired Fortnightly, founded by Anthony Trollope. Unfortunately, the last printed edition was published in 2013. Since then the magazine has been ‘dormant’.
Specializing in contemporary history and international affairs, I'd rather see myself more as a generalist than a specialist. In Contemporary Review I have published a wide variety of articles, book reviews and interviews. Some examples of my articles are:
“The Netherlands: From Euroscepticism to Europhoria” (2001)
“Europe and the New Constitution” (2004)
“Queen Juliana of the Netherlands, 1909-2004” (2004)
“Multiculturalism in the Netherlands and the Murder of Theo Van Gogh” (2005)
“Voters in the Netherlands Defy the European Constitution”
“George Kennan: The Career of a Cold War Diplomat” (2006)
“Dutch Politics: Exchanging Neo-Liberalism for Social Conservatism” (2007)
“The Dutch Commission’s Report on the Iraq War” (2010)
“The Netherlands and its Minority Government” (2011)
“Europe: Quo Vadis?” (2012)
Aside from articles I have also written many book reviews and conducted interviews. In 2014 I contributed to “Farewell MD-11”: this publication looks at the twenty years of service of this three-engined icon McDonnell Douglas MD-11 with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. “Farewell MD-11” was published in October 2014 by KLM Flight Operations.

I am always on the lookout for writing opportunities and will continue to do so. It is, however, my aim to combine my work in aviation with a (new) career in education. When I was a student I gained my first experience in education through a course at university and I also taught for two years at a tourism and hospitality school.

In a nutshell:

✓ Creative and enthusiastic Dutch translator and language specialist
✓ Informal and personal approach
✓ 10+ years of experience
✓ Language Lead and Expert for multiple accounts, like Airbnb, Cricut and Woolrich
✓QA Specialist (language quality, individual and team performance of Dutch freelance translators and teams)

Even though I encourage you to read on (because I get quite some emails asking me for projects I have to decline for various reasons), if you think you have all the information you need, you can contact me at  m.r.terbrugge[at]gmail.com to discuss options.

--------------------

Now, if you do have some more time, let me tell you a little more about myself:

My name is Marlieke and I'm an enthusiastic freelance Dutch Translator and Language Quality Specialist with more than 10 years experience both as an in-house and freelance translator for companies like Airbnb, Sublime, Cricut and PandaDoc. In these years I've focussed mainly on the travel and marketing industry, and am currently the Dutch Language Lead for (among others) Airbnb at Translated (managing the Dutch team of freelance translators and monitoring quality) and the Language Expert for Cricut, where I work closely with the localization manager and local team as well to bring language quality in their products and services to the next level for the Dutch market.

That's the business side of things. In my free time, I really love to write and create. From creative journaling and poetry to drawing and painting with watercolor. In spring and summer, you will most likely find me outside in nature (if the Dutch weather allows it), either gardening, taking photographs or exploring the forest with my two year old daughter and labrador. It's a nice change from all the time I spend in front of my computer ;) Aside from that, I also practice yoga and meditation daily, and like to binge watch a good series every now and then.

My business has evolved over the years from taking every translation job I can get to only working on projects I'm truly passionate about.  If you think we could be a match and you need:

➫ A Dutch translation of your English website, article, blog etc. (or review of existing Dutch content)
➫ Dutch subtitles for series, movies or documentaries or a QC specialist
➫ A Language Specialist to assess the translation quality of your current translator database
➫ A Dutch Language Lead

I'd love for you to contact me and say hi at m.r.terbrugge[at]gmail.com."

Throughout my career, I have worked on diverse projects in technical and commercial leadership roles, across execution, joint ventures, governance, and auditing. My experience spans multiple countries and cultures, providing me with a unique perspective on decision making.

I love to share my knowledge and expertise with others, through coaching, training, and facilitating. I add real value by helping teams and individuals manage risk and uncertainty, frame opportunities, and engage stakeholders. Through these interventions teams, departments, and organisations ultimately craft their quality decisions. My ability to work across hierarchies, foster collaboration, identify pain points, and motivate people sets me apart.

I enjoy what I do and enjoy doing it well. With DecisionQraft, that is what I do.
