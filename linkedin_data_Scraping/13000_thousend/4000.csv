Skilled in Petroleum geology and geophysics through seismic interpretation, with a special interest in Seismic Attributes and AvO and a passion -and track record- for coaching our new generation of subsurface specialists. Strong consulting professional with a Mr science in geophysics, physics and computer sciences from University of Utrecht. 

Established the 'SeismicO' company in 2018 as a vehicle for short term consult & assurance on critical elements of the seismic interpretation workflow.

After drilling, seismic data is often the single biggest operational investment. Do you monetise all of that intrinsic value in your seismic data? In order to extract maximum value, is the data in shape? Have your staff looked into it’s AvO potential? Is your local earth response in the seismic data adequately calibrated and understood through well ties? 

My 35 years of experience in the energy industry as subsurface specialist, trainer and coach, might just help lift your staff and project to the next higher level!

This work includes vectorisation, cache blocking,  better (MPI and OpenMP) scalable algorithms, optimisation of data throughput and IO, and porting to the latest architectures (e.g. Slingshot, GPU, ARM). 

My research in Geophysics (0.2) is focused on novel seismic imaging and processing techniques. Implementing, testing and verifying new methods is part of my work at TU Delft. The work I enjoy most is working together with PhD's and staff on challenging problems. My weekly working day in Delft is always too short. Back home I'm still full of ideas I could continue working on. 

My ambition lies in deepening my knowledge by learning new techniques and apply them to solve and implement complicated problems in an efficient way on modern compute hardware. I'm an expert in meta-programming to write lean, efficient and excellent performing code.  I would love to gain more knowledge about AI and combine it with various (deterministic) numerical techniques. 

Working in HPC with multi disciplinary teams on technical challenging problems is my favourite kind of work.  For me teamwork is key to solve scientific problems. 

In my function at HPE-Cray I have presented courses about HPC and MPI,  organised HPC workshops at international conferences (EAGE) and contributed to many scientific codes as pre-sales analyst. In 20 years I gained experience in weather and climate codes (HARMONIE/AROME, (Nor)CESM, FESOM, WRF), CFD (OpenFOAM), material science, quantum mechanics.

Playing a large part in design, equipping and managing the build of the highly successful PGS S-class Ramform. My role was in overall  management of the project: cost control and evaluation of technology improvements as well as managing design changes.

Improving fleet-wide vessel performance at PGS to a very high level; mostly achieved without major capex through a consistent improvement plan, interaction with sales, fostering best practice and diligent selection of equipment. A significant component of the succes was also due to the cooperation with streamer and electronics manufacturers, whereby very strict pre-delivery testing was introduced.

During this time, I was also a student assistant at the Mathematical Institute of this University.

In 2019, I completed my bachelor’s in industrial and Applied Mathematics at the Delft University of Technology. As part of the bachelor’s I completed a minor at the University of Nebraska, Omaha in Mathematics and Physics. Among others, I followed the course Modern Geometry, which discussed axiomatic Euclidean and elliptic geometry. This greatly increased my interest in the field of geometry. As such, I decided to do my bachelor thesis on axiomatic projective geometry.

Because of its expertise in geometry, I decided to pursue a master’s degree at Leiden University, which is a two-year program. Since I had to catch up some of the necessary background knowledge, I spent extra time in catching up on subjects such as ring and field theory, which are part of the bachelor’s program at Leiden University.

Photography. It is my way. Every picture is a story and a reality on its own. Photographing is my way to tell my stories and to create and express my reality. Personal, pure and human, that is how I like my photography. It is my love as well as my profession.

I was a kid, only six years old, and I was given an enticing present by my grandfather ~ Cornelis Wairata ~ . This present, which would stay with me forever, was my first camera. Ever since, I have been making photographs. A passion for life…..
At the age of 21 I started to be a professional photographer. For 10 years I was making my photographs for a living and then decided to do a study: Creative Photography at the Academy of Photography in Amsterdam. And why? Ha, I do invite you to ask me….

Always looking for new challenges, but drawn in particular towards making portraits and photo reports. The main reason? I am just in love with art and theatre….

Besides, I have a pronounced interest in symbolism and geometry; natural shapes you can find all throughout nature.
 
I love to play….. like a child….as pure as it gets…
 
I love to play with the ideas people come up with. Especially when there is room to experiment. Room to create a new reality together.

I obtained the degree of “Ingeniero Civil” from the UNSJ (Argentina) in 2001. I then worked as a structural engineer for two years before I was awarded the prestigious Fulbright Scholarship to pursue further studies in USA. I received my MSc in 2006 and my PhD in 2010 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). My PhD dissertation focused on the design of microvascular biomimetic materials. During my Ph.D. program, I received the Mavis Memorial Scholarship Award for academic excellence and research accomplishments. After my Ph.D., I held two postdoc appointments, where I studied the modeling of heterogeneous materials (UIUC) and computational contact mechanics (EPFL, Switzerland).

My Ph.D. program and postdoctorate positions shaped my research profile strongly on numerical methods. My research focuses on the creation of new enriched finite element technology and its application for solving complex engineering problems. I have worked on the design of novel materials and structures, the damage response of complex microstructures, the analysis and design of metamaterials—and phononic crystals in particular. My latest research efforts revolve on the creation of new enriched finite element methods for decoupling problem topology from finite element meshes when resolving discontinuities (e.g., material interfaces, cracks, and boundaries). My knowledge on enriched FEM is also taught in my own courses ""Advanced Finite Element Methods (ME46050),"" and ""Enriched Finite Element Methods (ME46080)"" at TU Delft. I am also collaborating on a book entitled ""Fundamentals of Enriched Finite Element Methods.""

Research interests:
1. Development of numerical methods for solving PDEs in solid mechanics, including • linear/nonlinear elasticity • contact mechanics • fracture mechanics • multiscale mechanics • immersed boundary (fictitious domain) problems • fluid-structure interaction. Methods include enriched finite element, virtual element, and spectral element methods • single and multi-objective optimization • topology optimization • genetic algorithms • machine (deep) learning.

2. Application of these methods to the computational analysis or design of novel(meta)materials and structures, including biomimetic materials • composites • acoustic metamaterials • origami."

I quickly understood that to approach these complex issues, History and Philosophy’s knowledge would be necessary, as both provide the ubiquitous and diachronic analytical tools to analyze the Political process. Thus, within my high-school, bachelor, and master’s years, I have studied Politics from a historical and philosophical perspective.

My PhD dissertation was about the Web and history education, a subject that allowed me to explore ways in which pupils come to, and use, online historical information. My research has mostly covered (alternative forms of) journalism, ethics of journalism, cultural memory (and its political implications), among others. At this moment I am busy thinking about writing Vol 3 of Memory Traps (www.memorytraps.com), the series that serves as a framework for me to reflect upon cultural memory, ethnicity, and politics in Rwanda from various perspectives. 

My professional background is in online journalism and radio reporting. I have worked for international media outlets, but I decided to also explore citizen journalism starting from 2007, as a trainer and coach. I believe that we can be better informed as citizens if local communities were involved in the journalistic process as news producers. Between 2007 and 2014 I trained more than 100 citizen journalists in 9 African countries in mobile reporting. With the mobile phone and some training, they have most of what they need to be part of the media landscape."

My motto is ""Pride in the Past, Ownership of the Future""

I am particularly interested in combining history of science with STEM/STEAM education.

I have a great passion for science and history of science communication and popularization. I have considerable experience in ""hands-on"" teaching of history of science by means of ""hands-on"" workshops. I have given workshops on Arabic science such as astrolabe workshop or workshop on geometric patterns in Islamic art in many countries.


I have also considerable experience with curatorial work. 

As one of my latest projects, for the Turkish Presidential Nation's Library, i have developed a exhibition with the title ""History of Islamic Science in 100 objects"" . The exhibition, which  consists of 100 objects of which are 87 replicas and 13 authentic medieval scientific manuscripts. The exhibition which opened it doors in April, 2021 has since been travelling. 

As the curator of the exhibition, I also wrote a 220+ page exhibition catalog for the exhibition, which is available both in Turkish and English. 

I also do consultancy work for auction houses where I am regularly asked to analyze, describe and evaluate medieval Arabic/Islamic scientific instruments & manuscripts."

I continued my activities as the focal point of a newly set up daugther company, which led to the essential knowledge of a multinational environment. The complexity of this challenge allowed me to coordinate several fields of activities in the same time, providing a general overview about the basic procedures of a multinational. The main focus was commercial management and daily communication with customers. With evoving the company’s size, I also got the chance to contribute to redistribution of the tasks on management level.

Due to changes in my location and professional career, I started widening my field of activities with learning psychology and practising art and dance therapy. Being a freelance interpreter at this period allowed me to harmonize the old and new fields of activities.

For me, history springs from the perennial human concern with self-discovery. While historical research and writing can never be completely shorn of its political nature, I believe that this work can also be considered an anthropological science which adds many layers of understanding to present-day problems.

My intention to study management of cultural heritage was driven mostly by my will to acquire a thorough understanding of the managerial practices and a wide array of instruments to critically evaluate them as well as knowledge of the artistic development through centuries. Over the past years, I had the opportunity to lay solid foundations in terms of both quantitative skills and economic theory revolving around cultural enterprises, deepening my knowledge of curatorial practices and legal institutes in addition to strengthening the study of the cultural heritage in its many manifestations. This has directed my enthusiasm to the role of institutions, international organizations, and NGOs in managing this relationship and in creating meaningful interchange between the territory, the cultural expression, and visitors.

At the moment my research interest covers three areas: the relationship between the education provided to young art professionals and the work market, opportunities for artists to find new forms to exhibit and share their artworks, and sustainable management of cultural heritage. 

Given my fond, long-term interest in the management of cultural heritage, sustainability, and accessibility of the arts which go beyond my more recent yet strong drive towards institutional responsibilities in these fields, I am committed and interested in all experiences that enhance my capabilities and push my boundaries both as a student and as a cultural leader through a balance between quantitative, qualitative research, and practice."

(2015). African Hairitage in Late Modern Europe: Exploring Individual and Social Factors in Hair Evaluations of Women with Afro-textured Hairstyles. [Master’s thesis, Tilburg University].

Contemporary Dutch society has diversified both ethnically and culturally as a result of globalization. Nowadays ethnic minorities make up more than half of the residents in the country’s four largest cities changing them into so‐called majority‐minority cities. The super‐diversity characteristic for these cities is clearly visible in street scenes flattering people with different identity markers such as ethnicity, attire, religion, hairstyle and so on. More than skin colour, hair has always been an important factor in defining one’s status and identity and although black hairstyles and identity have had extensive scholarly attention from mainly American scholars, little is known about the identity constructions related to afro‐textured hairstyles from a European perspective. Drawing on the novel Culturometrics methodology this research therefore aims to acquire both descriptive and analytic insight in the meaning of hair in the cultural identity constructions of women with afro‐textured hairstyles in the super‐diverse urban spaces of Late Modern Europe."

Andrew DJ Shield is Assistant Professor of Migration History at Leiden University, where he specializes in the sexuality, migration, and diversity in Europe since 1945.

BOOKS:
Dr. Shield's first book, Immigrants in the Sexual Revolution: Perceptions and Participation in Northwest Europe (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017), historicizes European debates about the sexual politics of immigrants from Muslim-majority regions, and challenges dominant theories linking immigration to sexual conservatism and misogynistic behaviour. 

His second book -- Immigrants on Grindr: Race, Sexuality and Belonging Online (Palgrave Macmillan, 2019) -- explores the importance of hook-up apps in the lives of gay and queer immigrants in Scandinavia, and how the online culture of these platforms promotes belonging or exclusion.

EDUCATION:
He holds one PhD in History from the Graduate Center of the City University of New York (2015), supervised by Dr. Dagmar Herzog, and a second PhD in Communication from Roskilde University in Denmark (2018) within Dr. Rikke Andreassen's ""New Media, New Intimacies"" research group.

As a natural thinker and creative person I have a broad range of interests ranging from news, politics and history, to art, science and biology. Writing and creative work are perhaps my most defining skillsets. In both these areas, I like to imagine that my original, but approachable style is what sets me apart. When it comes to writing I can be quite versatile: I am interested in academic style writing, but also commercial work, news articles, opinion pieces or anything else with a creative edge. The same is true for illustration and design; as long as there is originality involved, I am up for the job!

In day to day life, I am a sociable person who likes to surround himself with friends and family, but I can also very much enjoy spending time on my own. When applied to my professional life, this means that I can thrive inside a team, as well as work on projects individually for extended periods of time. Always in search of new inspiration, I am open to other ways of thinking and like to discuss all kinds of topics and ideas.

When it comes to my intellectual endeavours, the large, all-encompassing stories have often captured my imagination the most. And so, when conducting historiography, my focus regularly lies with the big questions and broad, sweeping histories. When studying a historic theme, I look at the large structures of imeaning and nterconnectedness and try to unravel how they developed over time. My preferred approach may thus be described as ""total history"", while the subject matter often falls into the category of cultural history or the history of mentalities, as exemplified by the Annales school.

Creatively, I have practiced many branches of art, both traditional and digital. Drawing pencil work of historical subjects, fantasy and science fiction has always been a favoured pass-time for me. I also have a lot of experience in pixel art, digital illustration and logo design and I am well acquainted with Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and Premiere.

Hoping to have provided you with a sensible overview of who I am and what I do. 

If you'd like to connect feel free to hit me up with a message! I am always open to exchange ideas, even in the most casual way!"

My experience & expertise:
Oral history ~Qualitative methods ~field based research ~lecturing bachelor students ~developing and coordinating curricula ~individual student supervision ~interviewing & collecting life stories ~conducting and coordinating oral history projects ~organizing story telling workshops ~ providing oral history training and workshops ~writing ~blogging

My activities: 
As an oral historian, I collect life stories of migrant families and their offspring in books, blogs, websites, and exhibitions. Being born into a family that was diverse in terms of gender, race, class, and sexuality, I know by experience what it means to be silenced and marginalized. By collecting the life stories of migrant families, I encourage them to speak up and become the owner of their own (hi)stories, thus countering dominant narratives around migrants and the or offspring. 
My latest oral history projects are the storytelling project Antara Nusa based on my latest book Antara Nusa that reveals the lives and experiences of elderly Amsterdammers who have roots in the former Dutch East Indies/Indonesia. Check https://lmpublishers.nl/catalogus/antara-nusa/.  
With our curriculum Ancestors Unknown Nederland, we encourage school kids in diverse classrooms to discover their ancestors and family histories through genealogy lessons (oral history interviewing and archival search) and history lessons on colonial and migration histories. Our recent program 'Tracing Your Roots' invites young adults in the former Dutch East Indies to pursuit the same search for their roots and their ancestors, thus encouraging them to envision their own identity and relation to our colonial past. 
Next to my work as an oral historian, I have 10 years of experience in lecturing in qualitative research methods and supervising bachelor students in their thesis. 
Next to these projects, I'm currently working on finalizing my PhD on migration, family, and identity in the life stories of Javanese-Surinamese women in the Netherlands

I indulge in every honest conversation as FAMILY COUNSELOR at our school and in my supporting role caring for vulnerable mothers at Leger des Heils, Kleur Cafe Den Haag and Het Rachamhuis.

Besides voluntary work and studying I make time for counseling sessions during a walk in The Hague.

Mothers face stressful times in every new phase in life, where they lose contact with their maternal instinct and are unable to see the full picture to reclaim and delegate responsibilities as mature leaders.

""KIND WALKS COUNSELING""
https://www.instagram.com/p/CnkiI4ItvgQ/?igshid=NjZiM2M3MzIxNA==

“HOLDING SPACE” provides a moment free of judgement, solutions or a plan that allows women to gain back ownership, vitality, resilience and hope simply by freely expressing their struggles preventing feelings of shame, guilt, confusion and isolation that often result in physical and mental health issues.

""AUTHENTICITY is the fruit of the courage that arises when we fully embrace our personality and history"".

Working out your GENOGRAM combined with the right questions, we unravel patterns, convictions and the effects passed on through GENERATIONS. 
Your physical struggles will also lead us to a full understanding, freedom and relief. 

Reflecting about our generational history produces Kindness and Gratitude for our life and Curiosity for our purpose. We will develop empathy, understanding and compassion for ourselves and others. 

I overcame irritable bowl syndroom, frozen shoulders, several allergies, people pleasing, burnouts and depression without the need of medication or therapy. As a living example of our body's SELF-HEALING ability based on the POLYVAGAL THEORY I am happy to help you out.  

Kind Walks offers company to CHRONICALLY SICK WOMEN that have understood the benefits of a daily walk but are in need of discipline, a new routine and accountability.
Depending on your condition we will meet during 2-3 months to walk together building up condition and a routine so that you will experience all the benefits and get used to walking on your own or inviting otters.

Choosing for solitude and self reflection during MINDFUL WALKING also heals, then you can count on my accountability. 

Everything Kind Walks offers is based on a free contribution and 25% of the profit is donated to Stichting Groundwork."

She works on European political and social history from the nineteenth century onwards, with a special interest in both the institutional as well as the popular experience of war and conflict, and the Second World War in particular. This translates to a focus on issues such as restorative justice, expropriation and confiscation of enemy property and Jewish assets. Core themes in her research are citizenship as mechanism of inclusion and exclusion, state- and nationhood, policy-making and governance in times of (post-) conflict and crisis, transitional justice and human rights.

Marieke Oprel has published on the classification and categorization of German nationals and Jewish German refugees in the aftermath of the Second World War. In 2020, she successfully defended her dissertation called ‘The Burden of Nationality. Dutch citizenship policies towards German nationals in the aftermath of the Second World War’, a project which was funded by NWO (Dutch Research Council). Her dissertation was published as a monograph by VU University Press. In 2021, she published a Dutch-language monograph for a larger audience, called ‘Afrekenen met de vijand’.

Recent publications include contributions to the volumes Property Rights in Wartime
Sequestration, Confiscation and Restitution in Twentieth-Century Europe (Routledge, 2023), Narratives of War (Routledge, 2019), Information and Power in History (Routledge, 2020) and a special issue of the European Review of History on property rights in wartime (2021). She is also co-editor of a volume on the Dutch political party PPR (Boom, 2022) 

Marieke Oprel is passionate about bringing history to a larger public, of which the project ‘Expropriation of Jewish property in WWII and the restoration of rights’ is a telling example. She is PI of this Radboud University project commissioned by several municipalities in the Netherlands reconstructing the expropriation of Jews during the Second World War.

Currently, Marieke Oprel is conducting research on the key players in Dutch post-war property expropriation in collaboration with the Tax & Customs Museum in Rotterdam and Tilburg University. 

Marieke Oprel is the coordinator of the MA track of Political History, ‘Politics and Parliament’. She has extensive teaching experience and has supervised multiple BA- and MA-theses on a large variety of topics."

I studied English at university in the Faculty of Foreign Languages though, I started my career in sales for an advertising production company because, the beauty and impact of advertising fascinated me so much.And then,I studied graphic design while working as a sales representative and became a graphic designer.

From my actual career, I know that advertising is about beauty and a way of communicating with customers. I also know that times are changing and that we use different tools such as websites, emails and social networks to express our brand and communicate with our customers.

I started fasting to lose weight almost seven years ago.
Fasting was an excellent opportunity to awaken my senses, reset my taste buds and reflect on my diet. There, I was reintroduced to dashi, which is at the heart of Japanese food culture.
I started a webmedia called Oishiidashi to promote the excellence of dashi.

I then embarked on an experimental journey to Europe to spread the wonders of dashi throughout the world.
It is difficult to promote dashi in Europe because the food culture and water are different from those in Japan, but I was convinced that umami could be spread worldwide.

Umami is a flavour with health benefits, but unlike salt and sugar, it is difficult to detect.
However, umami has a cultural and historical background and is closely linked to industry.

And umami is not unique to Japan; people worldwide can taste it in local foods. Umami makes people healthier and happier. And it changes lives.

I want to do everything we can to spread the goodness of umami."

As a researcher I was working together with officials from the Dutch Repatriation and Departure Service to research various theories regarding the motivations for accepting the return decisions that irregular migrants receive to depart back to their countries of origin. 

My master’s thesis focused on the institutionalist theories of political change related to the changing national policies in the Netherlands and Belgium with regard to their immigration and deportation laws between 1990 -1996. 

(Inter)national issues have been front and center of most of my working, academic and personal life. Growing up in the Netherlands, Ukraine and Syria adds a broad, intercultural perspective to my work and research, one that can also be applied to both private and public institutions.

I first came in contact with GIS while doing archaeological fieldwork and was immediately hooked. In 2009 and 2010 I did GIS work for several archaeological campaigns where I learned the basics of mapping, data management and collecting data in the field. This spurred me on to get some proper qualifications and I graduated with my MSc in GIS from Edinburgh University in 2012. 

While working for the Forestry Commission I learned what a bespoke GIS system can do for a big organisation and what it entails to manage and progress a massive software project. Here I was part of a GIS team who together had more than 80 years of GIS experience! From the FC I moved on to a small charity, again a major change of scenery where GIS played a very different but equally important role. I was the only GIS professional within CSGNT which means I managed and performed all GIS-related tasks. In the last few years I have therefore been able to develop the technical skills that I was taught in my MSc and I used ArcGIS Desktop, ArcGIS Online, QGIS, PostGIS, FME and Geoserver on a daily basis. 

In 2016 this experience meant that I was able to move back to my home country, the Netherlands, where I started working at Esri Nederland in the position of Content Engineer. Here I continued to develop my technical and data-related skills. Within the team I mainly focused on spatial analysis, the maintenance of our content within our ArcGIS Online portal and sharing knowledge through blogs and presentations.

Currently I work at BeoBOM, who have offered me a joined position, combining my degrees in history and GIS. Here I perform historical research for possible sites of WWII explosives and I analyse field data using GIS. 

The thing that my experience so far has taught me is also the thing I love most about working with GIS: it can be used in so many different fields for so many different things in so many different ways. I am up for any challenge presented to me and am very much looking forward to them!"

The focus of my current research is on late Nineteenth and Twentieth Century developments in mathematics and physics education at the secondary school level in the Netherlands, most notably involving the rise of new technology in educational practice (which involves history of AI, new media and computing most notably). I enjoy projects which take original source material into account and emphasise the broad cultural implications of science (education). Most noteworthy, I like using cartoons, novels, film footage, diary or college notes as (additional) source material, to illustrate the impact of certain developments in society. Currently, I'm writing a textbook on the ""where and why"" of mathematics during the past 2500 years.

In a former life I also worked as a consultant in special educational needs, in which role I advised both individuals and institutions. Students with special educational needs still are one of my soft spots. Thereby I follow this general guideline. Pupils and students with special educational needs are confronted with heavier tasks than other pupils and students. Acknowledging this fact does NOT imply that these students are best served by lightening their task. If they are capable of achieving the same goals as their fellow pupils and students, they should be allowed to develop themselves to their full potential; if not, teachers and educators should have the decency of showing these pupils and students a respectable alternative. It would be very helpful if educational institutions would pay more attention to the careers (ie: do these fit the certificates they obtained) of their former students, instead of focussing on the graduation of their present student population."

André Nijsen is the founding father of the SCM. From 1992 onwards he started developing methodologies for measuring the compliance costs of regulation. In 1994 the first product was Mistral®, the forerunner of the SCM. In January 2003 he obtained his PhD at the Erasmus University Rotterdam. The title of his thesis is: ""Dancing with the Octopus; Information obligations of enterprises in the social constitutional state from a public administration point of view."" Mistral® is one of the corner stones of this thesis. In 2005/6 he developed a new module of the SCM to measure the compliance costs of substantive obligations for enterprises, called SIROCCO, Scanning Instrument on Regulations for Other Compliance Costs. 

Besides this theoretical work, André Nijsen has a lot of practical experience in implementing the SCM in so-called base line measurements in all policy areas. He was involved in all Dutch base line measurements (2002 and 2007). He did countless SCM projects on separate laws and regulations in the Netherlands and in other countries.

André Nijsen has a lot of (inter)national experience as an adviser in the field of regulatory reform. He advised national governments in e.g. the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, South-Africa, Belgium, Slovenia, Dubai, Luxemburg, Germany, Austria, Romania and Kazakhstan. He also advised the European Commission, EUROSTAT, the OECD and the World Bank Group. André Nijsen also has experience in training officials in the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, South Africa, Slovenia, Luxemburg, Germany, Austria, Montenegro, Albania and Serbia with the application of impact assessments in the field of administrative burdens (compliance costs assessments).

I specialize in leveraging data, models, and new technologies for evidence-based decision-making on climate resilience and sustainable water management worldwide. Currently, I serve as a Senior Hydrologist and Climate Change Expert, also holding the role of Project Manager at FutureWater in the Netherlands. I lead international projects on flood forecasting, drought risk assessment, climate change impacts on water resources, and integrated water resources management.

💼🎓 Expertise & Impact 💼🎓
With a Ph.D. from Vrije Universiteit (VU) Amsterdam, my research focused on modeling hydroclimatic extremes, providing a strong foundation for my career. I've contributed significantly to cutting-edge climate and hydrological research at ICIMOD, Practical Action Consulting, VU, KNMI, and FutureWater. My expertise extends to water-food-energy systems, enriching my understanding of the intricate nexus between these essential resources.

🚀 Project Leadership 🚀
As a skilled Project Manager, I've led teams in developing flood forecasting systems, assessing climate change impacts on water, agriculture, energy, and water supply, and using machine learning for drought risk forecasting. My projects span diverse regions, including Nepal, Netherlands, India, Spain, Italy, Mozambique, Myanmar, China, UK, Germany, Laos, Tajikistan, and offline work in Georgia, Uzbekistan, Indonesia, and Colombia.

🌐 Global Training Experience 🌐
I take pride in being a seasoned trainer and capacity builder. Through workshops on hydrological modeling, climate risk assessment, and geospatial analysis, I've empowered professionals in Nepal, Myanmar, China, India, Mozambique, Laos, Tajikistan, and beyond to address water management and climate change challenges with innovative solutions.

I grabbed the opportunity to move from Los Angeles to Thailand before being asked to join a team in Dubai, where I met my French wife with whom I traveled around the world to more than 40 countries with before we settled in Amsterdam.

Since graduating with a BA in Visual Journalism from the Brooks Institute in California in 2010, I have worked professionally as a production manager, creative producer, video editor, videographer and project manager while working with teams in the USA, Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.

I gained diverse knowledge and experiences in various areas including risk management, project/change management, impact investing, CDD/KYC, business development, retail & SME banking, microfinance.

As a great connecter I like to match solutions to problems and overcome challenges. I can easily learn a new subject, initiate and take charge of a new project or an initiative. I am good at cross-functional collaboration and project work. My enthusiasm, down-to-earth mentality and perseverance enable me to get things done.

Nowadays companies in all industries are facing digital transformation, increasing competition and tougher regulation. They must adopt quickly to stay relevant and ahead of competition in a rapidly evolving environment. Over the past decade, I have been focusing on risk management and earned a couple of risk management certifications. Among my projects, I conducted a number of risk management assessments of financial institutions as a PRMIA’s certified independent institutional assessor in risk management by summarizing how they scored on strategic, governance, credit, financial and operational risks and consequently, guided them to improve their risk management system. In the period of 2018 – 2019, I served as a Deputy Chairperson of the PRMIA’s member-led working group that was formed to discuss and work on operational risk in Microfinance. 

So I can help companies to implement a systematic risk management approach to cope with challenges of transformation, growth and regulation complexity. I believe that my wealth of knowledge and experience would make me a valuable asset to many businesses seeking an expert in risk management. 

I am currently working as a consultant at PROX6 – a Dutch consulting company. Feel free to reach out to me via Linkedin to discuss how I can add value to your business.

My first migration journey as a baby resulted into a life-long balancing act between identities; this triggered an innate curiosity of everything that was different. I fell in love with personal storytelling when I was 11 years old and read The Diary Of Anne Frank for the first time. Since then, ‘Storylistening’ became my tool to discover and learn from the world around me.

I spent my first few adult years travelling the world before I decided to formalise my education through a bachelor degree in Communication and a Master in Politics of Global Development in Australia. My personal journey led to to work with international migration across four continents with local NGOs, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency and IOM - UN Migration. But dissatisfied with the current personal and global narratives about migration, encouraged me to found Pocket Stories to connect people with unheard voices through storytelling to embrace and accept diversity. 

Listening to and recording hundreds of personal stories from around the world has helped me to better understand how we are all interconnected, not in spite of, but because of human migration. We all have profound stories to tell. You and your stories are not alone. All our stories belongs in a much larger story, our shared collective story.

I've always had a drive to perform, an eagerness to learn and the talent to dream. I learned how to read at the age of 4 and skipped a year in primary school, which made me the smallest person at virtually all occasions until adulthood. Ironically, I also played national league basketball. Eventually got two university degrees and started working in M&A (CFCM) at ABN ARMO. After a couple of years of valuable high speed learning, I realised that I want to do what makes sense in the broader context; working on a mission that both contributes to and transcends my own and organizational goals. Combining the brain work with the heart work. And that is exactly what I am doing at FMO - the Dutch development bank.

Things I value in the work area: being professional, kind, courageous, decisive and responsible. I actively support training people's ability to reflect on their behavior and developing their emotional intelligence, resilience and personal leadership, as I believe these are increasingly important skills in our rapidly changing and dynamic world.

In May 2006, I decided to leave Cisco for Juniper, where I worked as a Premier Account Engineer for broadband solutions and later (end 2007) for core. In May 2011 I was promoted to Escalation Engineer for broadband solutions.

In september 2012, still within Juniper, I moved to a software engineering group, tasked with maintaing service cards for MX platforms. This was a fully self-contained, embedded platform that had me working at a fairly low level (as an example, I had to write a heurestic stack unwind for mips) as well as application level (carrier grade NAT was the main use for those cards).

In 2016, I was assigned to take care of LACP common code, which involved a fair amount of embedded work again (I was tasked to move LACP pdus transmission to the hardware, so-called ""inlining"") and some BSD kernel work.

Since 2019 I have been the lead engineer responsible for implementing TWAMP and RPM on Junos EVO from scratch for various platforms and bringing those to feature parity with legacy Junos.

Networking:
- Double CCIE (Cisco Certified Internetworking Engineer #12987) for the Routing and Switching as well as Service Provider tracks, with excellent knowledge of IOS.
- JNCIE-SP (#1466) and JNCIP-E (#97) certifications, with excellent knowledge of Junos and JunosE..
- Experience in most relevant networking protocols (routing, management) as well as in designing, maintaining and troubleshooting networks.

General Skills:
- Voice over IP (founder of www.myglobalconference.com)

Across my 20+ years of international and cross-sector experiences in futures research, transformational strategy, grassroots conservation, and sustainability communications, I have applied my superpowers to:
- Cultivate enhanced visibility for both UN and World Bank global environment programmes that boosted on-the-ground implementation and helped to inform policy-making processes at the national, regional and global level;
- Equip an innovation charity in the UK with fresh off-the-press future sustainability disruption trends that enabled organisational and strategic repositioning for the next 10 years;
- Inspire national and global policymakers to apply nature-based climate solutions to boost global biodiversity restoration efforts which contribute to the SDGs and the UN decade of Landscape Restoration;
- Build high-impact strategic communications capability across multiple companies and organisations to better engage their target audiences and shift the needle of behaviour change;
- Boost investor interest for sustainability-driven startups through impact branding and smart positioning.	

Today I capture all this experience in a unique offering that delivers real transformation and sustainable change. Depending on the size of the project, I also regularly collaborate with my network of of awesome sustainability thinkers, strategists, creatives, futurists, storytellers, trend researchers, designers, trainers and facilitators to help me deliver the transformation required that then helps you drive the sustainability movement and be known for it.

I’ve lived and worked in Costa Rica, Panama, Switzerland, Spain, Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Tanzania. I currently live in the Netherlands. When I’m not working on organisational transformation, I enjoy devouring information about human connection, personal growth and somatic healing as well as immersing myself in the wilderness to disconnect, recharge and reconnect.

Blijvende, toekomstige betrokkenheid spreekt vanzelf. In mijn rol als bestuurder zet ik in op het ontwikkelen van een strategie, procesbegeleiding om in gezamenlijkheid, in verbinding, een eindresultaat te kunnen behalen of een beweging te kunnen bewerkstelligen.

Can we make nations less dependent on official development assistance or address root causes for youth unemployment (leading to large-scale migration)?

I believe the answers to many of these are sustainable economic development, with emphasis on job creation and local value-adding enterprise development. 
 
Profit is not a single bottom line! Economics of mutuality considers benefits of companies investing in its communities, people and environmental system.

If we help create an enabling environment, build people’s capacities with marketable skills and support local enterprise development, then more people in the BOP can earn a living wage. And by helping them develop their sustainable livelihood, they will increasingly be able to provide for their families, educate their children, access health care, etc. I believe this should arise from business development and job creation, using market based approaches and agricultural value chains.

note: there is an obious difference between could be, should be and want to be. At the current point in my career, technical leadership is more of interest than pure development. Sure, I will do whatever the situation might require, but technical leadership in a position that requires insight and can drive innovation, leading to practical solutions would be the most optimal use of my talents and potential .

I am  very gifted in the ability to translate technical jargon into executive and workfloor-friendly metaphors and vice-versa.

This technical prowess is coupled with an ability to formulate solutions to any problem on short-term, middle to long term, taking into account the business context (budget, time, material, resources).

This also means that I have a strong knowledge and theoretical background of algorithms, and I am an accomplished programmer in languages like C, C++ and Java, and can adapt to and learn new technology in a very short amount of time.

I have the ability to motivate people and nudge them gently out of their comfort zone. I am a leader by consensus, meaning that all team members are equally important, and each opinion is weighed on the base of its own merit. When tough decision have to be made, I am not afraid to make them. 

Bottom-Line: I am a Solution Provider, where Solutions take into account the complete context, rather than just the technical. For me, it is not a matter of thinking outside the box. I was not thinking in terms of boxes to begin with. I will tell you like it is - or how I perceive it is, what the dangers and risks are of any given proposal and I will leave the decisionmaking based on my assessments to you. Unless of course you delegate the decision-making to me.

Member of DNHK - German-Dutch Chamber of Commerce. 

➡️ Along with my partners, I have recruited exceptional digital leaders, sales and business development executives for my clients in Benelux and German speaking countries.  Have helped many Dutch companies with their expansion and recruitment needs for Top Talent in Germany.

Get in touch with me if you recognise my values:

✅	You need an expert recruiter, who understands your challenges and provides a consultative no-nonsense approach.
✅	You need a committed search specialist; not a generalist recruiter, who does not give you any exclusivity.
✅	You do not want to limit yourself to the small percentage of active candidates, but want your vacancy filled by the best candidates, who typically do not look at any job posts. 
✅	As a candidate, if you are looking for a new position or just need you need an unbiased career advice. I know the market and work with some of the best companies.

MY BACKGROUND

I am fluent in English, German, Russian and Dutch (native) and feel privileged to have lived and worked in different countries before, such as in Germany, Nordics, Baltics and Russia. I understood long ago that that the most valuable asset of any team and company lies directly in its people. I naturally gravitated towards executive recruitment - finding and attracting the best talent is what I love doing since many years. I have become a valued trusted advisor for my clients and take pride into the fact that I managed to complete over 350 hard- to- fill (international) search assignments so far.

Outside of work, you'll find me either at a squash court; football pitch or I am engaged in some other sort of outdoor activity.  Oh.. and my passion is wine – in 2019 I managed to visit 25 French wine castles.  ☺"

My name is Elena 🙋🏻‍♀️ I was born and raised in Russia. 

Because of my job, I moved to Germany in 2017, and love brought me to the Netherlands in 2019. Moving comes with challenges, also from a professional point of view. E.g. learning and adjusting to different business environments and cultures. These changes helped me develop my professional skills. Throughout my career, I gained experience mostly in b2b sales & customer support, where I assisted the international sales team by:
- coordinating activities and handling deadlines (time management);
- contacting customers worldwide (advanced level business English);
- managing data in CRM and ERP software (key user);
- and ensuring smooth day-to-day operations. 

My analytical skills, creativity and problem-solving abilities helped me identify possible customers’ objections and find mutually beneficial solutions for all stakeholders involved.

I have Dutch nationality. And currently, I live with my partner and our sons in Enschede, Netherlands. My Dutch level (speaking and understanding) is B1-level. 

What I started learning at my University (specialising in International Relations) is benefitting me today:
- about different cultures
- values
- and beliefs. 

It helped me become the person I am today: adjusting, tolerant, open-minded and curious. Mostly curious about new tech and the latest software solutions (ChatGPT, AI).

Consider a world where we no longer listen to the loudest expert but instead to the person with the best data-driven explanation — an explanation that is verifiable because it is based on open-source intelligence (OSINT).

Our Vision: To change the way policy and business decisions are made in an information-rich world.
To move towards that vision, we started tracking a country with which we at Datenna are most familiar: China.

Our Mission: We empower organisations to eliminate the information gap they have [with China] by providing the best [China] OSINT software.

I define myself as a diplomat-turned-entrepreneur. After having worked at the Dutch Embassy in Beijing and Consulate in Shanghai and lived there for 12+ years, I decided to move back to the Netherlands and founded Datenna, the world leading provider of economic intelligence on China.

At Datenna, we are building a new way to conduct Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT). Through our automated and AI-assisted algorithms, we are supporting governments worldwide in conducting in-depth research on the Chinese industry, innovation, and academia in an efficient and reliable fashion.

Before founding the company, I had been tracking China’s technological and economic development for 15 years. During my time in China, I visited 1000+ Chinese companies, government organizations, and research institutes, where I dealt with topics as diverse as stem cells, nuclear energy, 5G, big data, and semiconductors. Since I could not keep track of all Chinese technological and scientific progresses, I started Datenna: a company that mixes software engineering and data science with China expertise.

On a personal level, I am a technology enthusiast by nature and a software engineer by education. Besides sciences, I have a soft spot for human factors and psychology/sociology. How is technology changing us? How is it going to change us? And how can we influence the direction and speed of technological progress?"

After graduating from business school with a specialization in Asian Business Studies, moving to China, the land of opportunities, to start my career was an obvious step to take. During my studies I followed an exchange program in Beijing at UIBE (对外经济贸易大学), and did a work-placement in Chengdu. Knowing the difference between first and second tier China first-hand gave me a clear preference for the latter; the ‘real’ China.

China has always interested me: its long history, its fast growth, the differences with my own culture and the personal way of doing business. It's the land of opportunities, but also a land with many pitfalls. As an organization and a person you have to always be ready to adapt to China’s fast changing environment. Knowing your own business is not enough; you need to know the local differences, challenges and possibilities and translate your business plan accordingly. In these times you need to ‘think global, but act local’.

During my studies and time living in China I have built up my knowledge of both international business theory and Chinese practice. I have experienced a broad education with an Asian perspective, studying subjects like Strategic Management, Organizational Theory, Marketing, Finance, Budgeting, Asian Management, Chinese and Statistics. 

This skill set helps me to lead a varied range of projects and consult on many different aspects of doing business in China. Furthermore, during my studies and working experiences I developed analytical and planning skills, which help me evaluate situations over a short timeframe and come up with lasting solutions. I am well acquainted with working in international teams and with people from different professions to solve a problem. 

After living in China for over 7 years I have decided to move back to The Netherlands with my family. Utilizing my experience and expertise to function as a bridge between China and Europe."

Keeping self-challenge is never easy but it makes me become a better version of myself. After nine years of working as a contract and commercial manager in the telecommunication sector, I changed my career to banking industry and became a KYC officer. It was proved by fact that I had made a right decision.

I believe in never stop learning. It is my way to explore and experience the world, spiritually and physically. So to me, learning is not just about courses, training and reading. It is also about to know and understand different people, to travel and discover a new city, and to take in different cultures. All those ways helped me to become who am I and to the “Me” I like.

He dicovered a large number of DNA variants and epigenomic markers highly informative for accurate prediction of human appearance traits; his work laid the foundation for two DNA test systems for predicting eye color and hair color, which are already in use for forensic and anthropological applications internationally. He has published over 80 scientific articles on SCI journals including over 20 first/corresponding author papers published on journals such as Nat Genet, Am J Hum Genet, eLife, Curr Bio, PLoS Genet, Hum Mol Genet, Hum Genet, and Forensic Sci Int Genet.

As part of my employment at the Beijing Institute of Genomics Chinese Academy of Sciences (BIG), in 1st July, 2017, I started to collaborate with scientists from the Beijing Institute of Forensic Sciences, Chinese Ministry of Public Security. This scientific collaboration concerned statistical analyses of genomic and epigenomic data my group at BIG carried out. These data were provided to my group at BIG by the Institute of Forensic Sciences as part of this scientific collaboration. The samples from which these data were generated had been collected by the Institute of Forensic Sciences. After the collaborative papers had been published, this scientific collaboration was discontinued from my side in May, 2019."
