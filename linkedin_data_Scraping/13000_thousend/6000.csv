Skilled in Petroleum geology and geophysics through seismic interpretation, with a special interest in Seismic Attributes and AvO and a passion -and track record- for coaching our new generation of subsurface specialists. Strong consulting professional with a Mr science in geophysics, physics and computer sciences from University of Utrecht. 

Established the 'SeismicO' company in 2018 as a vehicle for short term consult & assurance on critical elements of the seismic interpretation workflow.

After drilling, seismic data is often the single biggest operational investment. Do you monetise all of that intrinsic value in your seismic data? In order to extract maximum value, is the data in shape? Have your staff looked into it’s AvO potential? Is your local earth response in the seismic data adequately calibrated and understood through well ties? 

My 35 years of experience in the energy industry as subsurface specialist, trainer and coach, might just help lift your staff and project to the next higher level!

This work includes vectorisation, cache blocking,  better (MPI and OpenMP) scalable algorithms, optimisation of data throughput and IO, and porting to the latest architectures (e.g. Slingshot, GPU, ARM). 

My research in Geophysics (0.2) is focused on novel seismic imaging and processing techniques. Implementing, testing and verifying new methods is part of my work at TU Delft. The work I enjoy most is working together with PhD's and staff on challenging problems. My weekly working day in Delft is always too short. Back home I'm still full of ideas I could continue working on. 

My ambition lies in deepening my knowledge by learning new techniques and apply them to solve and implement complicated problems in an efficient way on modern compute hardware. I'm an expert in meta-programming to write lean, efficient and excellent performing code.  I would love to gain more knowledge about AI and combine it with various (deterministic) numerical techniques. 

Working in HPC with multi disciplinary teams on technical challenging problems is my favourite kind of work.  For me teamwork is key to solve scientific problems. 

In my function at HPE-Cray I have presented courses about HPC and MPI,  organised HPC workshops at international conferences (EAGE) and contributed to many scientific codes as pre-sales analyst. In 20 years I gained experience in weather and climate codes (HARMONIE/AROME, (Nor)CESM, FESOM, WRF), CFD (OpenFOAM), material science, quantum mechanics.

Playing a large part in design, equipping and managing the build of the highly successful PGS S-class Ramform. My role was in overall  management of the project: cost control and evaluation of technology improvements as well as managing design changes.

Improving fleet-wide vessel performance at PGS to a very high level; mostly achieved without major capex through a consistent improvement plan, interaction with sales, fostering best practice and diligent selection of equipment. A significant component of the succes was also due to the cooperation with streamer and electronics manufacturers, whereby very strict pre-delivery testing was introduced.

During this time, I was also a student assistant at the Mathematical Institute of this University.

In 2019, I completed my bachelor’s in industrial and Applied Mathematics at the Delft University of Technology. As part of the bachelor’s I completed a minor at the University of Nebraska, Omaha in Mathematics and Physics. Among others, I followed the course Modern Geometry, which discussed axiomatic Euclidean and elliptic geometry. This greatly increased my interest in the field of geometry. As such, I decided to do my bachelor thesis on axiomatic projective geometry.

Because of its expertise in geometry, I decided to pursue a master’s degree at Leiden University, which is a two-year program. Since I had to catch up some of the necessary background knowledge, I spent extra time in catching up on subjects such as ring and field theory, which are part of the bachelor’s program at Leiden University.

Photography. It is my way. Every picture is a story and a reality on its own. Photographing is my way to tell my stories and to create and express my reality. Personal, pure and human, that is how I like my photography. It is my love as well as my profession.

I was a kid, only six years old, and I was given an enticing present by my grandfather ~ Cornelis Wairata ~ . This present, which would stay with me forever, was my first camera. Ever since, I have been making photographs. A passion for life…..
At the age of 21 I started to be a professional photographer. For 10 years I was making my photographs for a living and then decided to do a study: Creative Photography at the Academy of Photography in Amsterdam. And why? Ha, I do invite you to ask me….

Always looking for new challenges, but drawn in particular towards making portraits and photo reports. The main reason? I am just in love with art and theatre….

Besides, I have a pronounced interest in symbolism and geometry; natural shapes you can find all throughout nature.
 
I love to play….. like a child….as pure as it gets…
 
I love to play with the ideas people come up with. Especially when there is room to experiment. Room to create a new reality together.

I obtained the degree of “Ingeniero Civil” from the UNSJ (Argentina) in 2001. I then worked as a structural engineer for two years before I was awarded the prestigious Fulbright Scholarship to pursue further studies in USA. I received my MSc in 2006 and my PhD in 2010 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). My PhD dissertation focused on the design of microvascular biomimetic materials. During my Ph.D. program, I received the Mavis Memorial Scholarship Award for academic excellence and research accomplishments. After my Ph.D., I held two postdoc appointments, where I studied the modeling of heterogeneous materials (UIUC) and computational contact mechanics (EPFL, Switzerland).

My Ph.D. program and postdoctorate positions shaped my research profile strongly on numerical methods. My research focuses on the creation of new enriched finite element technology and its application for solving complex engineering problems. I have worked on the design of novel materials and structures, the damage response of complex microstructures, the analysis and design of metamaterials—and phononic crystals in particular. My latest research efforts revolve on the creation of new enriched finite element methods for decoupling problem topology from finite element meshes when resolving discontinuities (e.g., material interfaces, cracks, and boundaries). My knowledge on enriched FEM is also taught in my own courses ""Advanced Finite Element Methods (ME46050),"" and ""Enriched Finite Element Methods (ME46080)"" at TU Delft. I am also collaborating on a book entitled ""Fundamentals of Enriched Finite Element Methods.""

Research interests:
1. Development of numerical methods for solving PDEs in solid mechanics, including • linear/nonlinear elasticity • contact mechanics • fracture mechanics • multiscale mechanics • immersed boundary (fictitious domain) problems • fluid-structure interaction. Methods include enriched finite element, virtual element, and spectral element methods • single and multi-objective optimization • topology optimization • genetic algorithms • machine (deep) learning.

2. Application of these methods to the computational analysis or design of novel(meta)materials and structures, including biomimetic materials • composites • acoustic metamaterials • origami."

I quickly understood that to approach these complex issues, History and Philosophy’s knowledge would be necessary, as both provide the ubiquitous and diachronic analytical tools to analyze the Political process. Thus, within my high-school, bachelor, and master’s years, I have studied Politics from a historical and philosophical perspective.

My PhD dissertation was about the Web and history education, a subject that allowed me to explore ways in which pupils come to, and use, online historical information. My research has mostly covered (alternative forms of) journalism, ethics of journalism, cultural memory (and its political implications), among others. At this moment I am busy thinking about writing Vol 3 of Memory Traps (www.memorytraps.com), the series that serves as a framework for me to reflect upon cultural memory, ethnicity, and politics in Rwanda from various perspectives. 

My professional background is in online journalism and radio reporting. I have worked for international media outlets, but I decided to also explore citizen journalism starting from 2007, as a trainer and coach. I believe that we can be better informed as citizens if local communities were involved in the journalistic process as news producers. Between 2007 and 2014 I trained more than 100 citizen journalists in 9 African countries in mobile reporting. With the mobile phone and some training, they have most of what they need to be part of the media landscape."

My motto is ""Pride in the Past, Ownership of the Future""

I am particularly interested in combining history of science with STEM/STEAM education.

I have a great passion for science and history of science communication and popularization. I have considerable experience in ""hands-on"" teaching of history of science by means of ""hands-on"" workshops. I have given workshops on Arabic science such as astrolabe workshop or workshop on geometric patterns in Islamic art in many countries.


I have also considerable experience with curatorial work. 

As one of my latest projects, for the Turkish Presidential Nation's Library, i have developed a exhibition with the title ""History of Islamic Science in 100 objects"" . The exhibition, which  consists of 100 objects of which are 87 replicas and 13 authentic medieval scientific manuscripts. The exhibition which opened it doors in April, 2021 has since been travelling. 

As the curator of the exhibition, I also wrote a 220+ page exhibition catalog for the exhibition, which is available both in Turkish and English. 

I also do consultancy work for auction houses where I am regularly asked to analyze, describe and evaluate medieval Arabic/Islamic scientific instruments & manuscripts."

I continued my activities as the focal point of a newly set up daugther company, which led to the essential knowledge of a multinational environment. The complexity of this challenge allowed me to coordinate several fields of activities in the same time, providing a general overview about the basic procedures of a multinational. The main focus was commercial management and daily communication with customers. With evoving the company’s size, I also got the chance to contribute to redistribution of the tasks on management level.

Due to changes in my location and professional career, I started widening my field of activities with learning psychology and practising art and dance therapy. Being a freelance interpreter at this period allowed me to harmonize the old and new fields of activities.

For me, history springs from the perennial human concern with self-discovery. While historical research and writing can never be completely shorn of its political nature, I believe that this work can also be considered an anthropological science which adds many layers of understanding to present-day problems.

My intention to study management of cultural heritage was driven mostly by my will to acquire a thorough understanding of the managerial practices and a wide array of instruments to critically evaluate them as well as knowledge of the artistic development through centuries. Over the past years, I had the opportunity to lay solid foundations in terms of both quantitative skills and economic theory revolving around cultural enterprises, deepening my knowledge of curatorial practices and legal institutes in addition to strengthening the study of the cultural heritage in its many manifestations. This has directed my enthusiasm to the role of institutions, international organizations, and NGOs in managing this relationship and in creating meaningful interchange between the territory, the cultural expression, and visitors.

At the moment my research interest covers three areas: the relationship between the education provided to young art professionals and the work market, opportunities for artists to find new forms to exhibit and share their artworks, and sustainable management of cultural heritage. 

Given my fond, long-term interest in the management of cultural heritage, sustainability, and accessibility of the arts which go beyond my more recent yet strong drive towards institutional responsibilities in these fields, I am committed and interested in all experiences that enhance my capabilities and push my boundaries both as a student and as a cultural leader through a balance between quantitative, qualitative research, and practice."

(2015). African Hairitage in Late Modern Europe: Exploring Individual and Social Factors in Hair Evaluations of Women with Afro-textured Hairstyles. [Master’s thesis, Tilburg University].

Contemporary Dutch society has diversified both ethnically and culturally as a result of globalization. Nowadays ethnic minorities make up more than half of the residents in the country’s four largest cities changing them into so‐called majority‐minority cities. The super‐diversity characteristic for these cities is clearly visible in street scenes flattering people with different identity markers such as ethnicity, attire, religion, hairstyle and so on. More than skin colour, hair has always been an important factor in defining one’s status and identity and although black hairstyles and identity have had extensive scholarly attention from mainly American scholars, little is known about the identity constructions related to afro‐textured hairstyles from a European perspective. Drawing on the novel Culturometrics methodology this research therefore aims to acquire both descriptive and analytic insight in the meaning of hair in the cultural identity constructions of women with afro‐textured hairstyles in the super‐diverse urban spaces of Late Modern Europe."

Andrew DJ Shield is Assistant Professor of Migration History at Leiden University, where he specializes in the sexuality, migration, and diversity in Europe since 1945.

BOOKS:
Dr. Shield's first book, Immigrants in the Sexual Revolution: Perceptions and Participation in Northwest Europe (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017), historicizes European debates about the sexual politics of immigrants from Muslim-majority regions, and challenges dominant theories linking immigration to sexual conservatism and misogynistic behaviour. 

His second book -- Immigrants on Grindr: Race, Sexuality and Belonging Online (Palgrave Macmillan, 2019) -- explores the importance of hook-up apps in the lives of gay and queer immigrants in Scandinavia, and how the online culture of these platforms promotes belonging or exclusion.

EDUCATION:
He holds one PhD in History from the Graduate Center of the City University of New York (2015), supervised by Dr. Dagmar Herzog, and a second PhD in Communication from Roskilde University in Denmark (2018) within Dr. Rikke Andreassen's ""New Media, New Intimacies"" research group.

As a natural thinker and creative person I have a broad range of interests ranging from news, politics and history, to art, science and biology. Writing and creative work are perhaps my most defining skillsets. In both these areas, I like to imagine that my original, but approachable style is what sets me apart. When it comes to writing I can be quite versatile: I am interested in academic style writing, but also commercial work, news articles, opinion pieces or anything else with a creative edge. The same is true for illustration and design; as long as there is originality involved, I am up for the job!

In day to day life, I am a sociable person who likes to surround himself with friends and family, but I can also very much enjoy spending time on my own. When applied to my professional life, this means that I can thrive inside a team, as well as work on projects individually for extended periods of time. Always in search of new inspiration, I am open to other ways of thinking and like to discuss all kinds of topics and ideas.

When it comes to my intellectual endeavours, the large, all-encompassing stories have often captured my imagination the most. And so, when conducting historiography, my focus regularly lies with the big questions and broad, sweeping histories. When studying a historic theme, I look at the large structures of imeaning and nterconnectedness and try to unravel how they developed over time. My preferred approach may thus be described as ""total history"", while the subject matter often falls into the category of cultural history or the history of mentalities, as exemplified by the Annales school.

Creatively, I have practiced many branches of art, both traditional and digital. Drawing pencil work of historical subjects, fantasy and science fiction has always been a favoured pass-time for me. I also have a lot of experience in pixel art, digital illustration and logo design and I am well acquainted with Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and Premiere.

Hoping to have provided you with a sensible overview of who I am and what I do. 

If you'd like to connect feel free to hit me up with a message! I am always open to exchange ideas, even in the most casual way!"

My experience & expertise:
Oral history ~Qualitative methods ~field based research ~lecturing bachelor students ~developing and coordinating curricula ~individual student supervision ~interviewing & collecting life stories ~conducting and coordinating oral history projects ~organizing story telling workshops ~ providing oral history training and workshops ~writing ~blogging

My activities: 
As an oral historian, I collect life stories of migrant families and their offspring in books, blogs, websites, and exhibitions. Being born into a family that was diverse in terms of gender, race, class, and sexuality, I know by experience what it means to be silenced and marginalized. By collecting the life stories of migrant families, I encourage them to speak up and become the owner of their own (hi)stories, thus countering dominant narratives around migrants and the or offspring. 
My latest oral history projects are the storytelling project Antara Nusa based on my latest book Antara Nusa that reveals the lives and experiences of elderly Amsterdammers who have roots in the former Dutch East Indies/Indonesia. Check https://lmpublishers.nl/catalogus/antara-nusa/.  
With our curriculum Ancestors Unknown Nederland, we encourage school kids in diverse classrooms to discover their ancestors and family histories through genealogy lessons (oral history interviewing and archival search) and history lessons on colonial and migration histories. Our recent program 'Tracing Your Roots' invites young adults in the former Dutch East Indies to pursuit the same search for their roots and their ancestors, thus encouraging them to envision their own identity and relation to our colonial past. 
Next to my work as an oral historian, I have 10 years of experience in lecturing in qualitative research methods and supervising bachelor students in their thesis. 
Next to these projects, I'm currently working on finalizing my PhD on migration, family, and identity in the life stories of Javanese-Surinamese women in the Netherlands

I indulge in every honest conversation as FAMILY COUNSELOR at our school and in my supporting role caring for vulnerable mothers at Leger des Heils, Kleur Cafe Den Haag and Het Rachamhuis.

Besides voluntary work and studying I make time for counseling sessions during a walk in The Hague.

Mothers face stressful times in every new phase in life, where they lose contact with their maternal instinct and are unable to see the full picture to reclaim and delegate responsibilities as mature leaders.

""KIND WALKS COUNSELING""
https://www.instagram.com/p/CnkiI4ItvgQ/?igshid=NjZiM2M3MzIxNA==

“HOLDING SPACE” provides a moment free of judgement, solutions or a plan that allows women to gain back ownership, vitality, resilience and hope simply by freely expressing their struggles preventing feelings of shame, guilt, confusion and isolation that often result in physical and mental health issues.

""AUTHENTICITY is the fruit of the courage that arises when we fully embrace our personality and history"".

Working out your GENOGRAM combined with the right questions, we unravel patterns, convictions and the effects passed on through GENERATIONS. 
Your physical struggles will also lead us to a full understanding, freedom and relief. 

Reflecting about our generational history produces Kindness and Gratitude for our life and Curiosity for our purpose. We will develop empathy, understanding and compassion for ourselves and others. 

I overcame irritable bowl syndroom, frozen shoulders, several allergies, people pleasing, burnouts and depression without the need of medication or therapy. As a living example of our body's SELF-HEALING ability based on the POLYVAGAL THEORY I am happy to help you out.  

Kind Walks offers company to CHRONICALLY SICK WOMEN that have understood the benefits of a daily walk but are in need of discipline, a new routine and accountability.
Depending on your condition we will meet during 2-3 months to walk together building up condition and a routine so that you will experience all the benefits and get used to walking on your own or inviting otters.

Choosing for solitude and self reflection during MINDFUL WALKING also heals, then you can count on my accountability. 

Everything Kind Walks offers is based on a free contribution and 25% of the profit is donated to Stichting Groundwork."

She works on European political and social history from the nineteenth century onwards, with a special interest in both the institutional as well as the popular experience of war and conflict, and the Second World War in particular. This translates to a focus on issues such as restorative justice, expropriation and confiscation of enemy property and Jewish assets. Core themes in her research are citizenship as mechanism of inclusion and exclusion, state- and nationhood, policy-making and governance in times of (post-) conflict and crisis, transitional justice and human rights.

Marieke Oprel has published on the classification and categorization of German nationals and Jewish German refugees in the aftermath of the Second World War. In 2020, she successfully defended her dissertation called ‘The Burden of Nationality. Dutch citizenship policies towards German nationals in the aftermath of the Second World War’, a project which was funded by NWO (Dutch Research Council). Her dissertation was published as a monograph by VU University Press. In 2021, she published a Dutch-language monograph for a larger audience, called ‘Afrekenen met de vijand’.

Recent publications include contributions to the volumes Property Rights in Wartime
Sequestration, Confiscation and Restitution in Twentieth-Century Europe (Routledge, 2023), Narratives of War (Routledge, 2019), Information and Power in History (Routledge, 2020) and a special issue of the European Review of History on property rights in wartime (2021). She is also co-editor of a volume on the Dutch political party PPR (Boom, 2022) 

Marieke Oprel is passionate about bringing history to a larger public, of which the project ‘Expropriation of Jewish property in WWII and the restoration of rights’ is a telling example. She is PI of this Radboud University project commissioned by several municipalities in the Netherlands reconstructing the expropriation of Jews during the Second World War.

Currently, Marieke Oprel is conducting research on the key players in Dutch post-war property expropriation in collaboration with the Tax & Customs Museum in Rotterdam and Tilburg University. 

Marieke Oprel is the coordinator of the MA track of Political History, ‘Politics and Parliament’. She has extensive teaching experience and has supervised multiple BA- and MA-theses on a large variety of topics."

I studied English at university in the Faculty of Foreign Languages though, I started my career in sales for an advertising production company because, the beauty and impact of advertising fascinated me so much.And then,I studied graphic design while working as a sales representative and became a graphic designer.

From my actual career, I know that advertising is about beauty and a way of communicating with customers. I also know that times are changing and that we use different tools such as websites, emails and social networks to express our brand and communicate with our customers.

I started fasting to lose weight almost seven years ago.
Fasting was an excellent opportunity to awaken my senses, reset my taste buds and reflect on my diet. There, I was reintroduced to dashi, which is at the heart of Japanese food culture.
I started a webmedia called Oishiidashi to promote the excellence of dashi.

I then embarked on an experimental journey to Europe to spread the wonders of dashi throughout the world.
It is difficult to promote dashi in Europe because the food culture and water are different from those in Japan, but I was convinced that umami could be spread worldwide.

Umami is a flavour with health benefits, but unlike salt and sugar, it is difficult to detect.
However, umami has a cultural and historical background and is closely linked to industry.

And umami is not unique to Japan; people worldwide can taste it in local foods. Umami makes people healthier and happier. And it changes lives.

I want to do everything we can to spread the goodness of umami."

As a researcher I was working together with officials from the Dutch Repatriation and Departure Service to research various theories regarding the motivations for accepting the return decisions that irregular migrants receive to depart back to their countries of origin. 

My master’s thesis focused on the institutionalist theories of political change related to the changing national policies in the Netherlands and Belgium with regard to their immigration and deportation laws between 1990 -1996. 

(Inter)national issues have been front and center of most of my working, academic and personal life. Growing up in the Netherlands, Ukraine and Syria adds a broad, intercultural perspective to my work and research, one that can also be applied to both private and public institutions.

I first came in contact with GIS while doing archaeological fieldwork and was immediately hooked. In 2009 and 2010 I did GIS work for several archaeological campaigns where I learned the basics of mapping, data management and collecting data in the field. This spurred me on to get some proper qualifications and I graduated with my MSc in GIS from Edinburgh University in 2012. 

While working for the Forestry Commission I learned what a bespoke GIS system can do for a big organisation and what it entails to manage and progress a massive software project. Here I was part of a GIS team who together had more than 80 years of GIS experience! From the FC I moved on to a small charity, again a major change of scenery where GIS played a very different but equally important role. I was the only GIS professional within CSGNT which means I managed and performed all GIS-related tasks. In the last few years I have therefore been able to develop the technical skills that I was taught in my MSc and I used ArcGIS Desktop, ArcGIS Online, QGIS, PostGIS, FME and Geoserver on a daily basis. 

In 2016 this experience meant that I was able to move back to my home country, the Netherlands, where I started working at Esri Nederland in the position of Content Engineer. Here I continued to develop my technical and data-related skills. Within the team I mainly focused on spatial analysis, the maintenance of our content within our ArcGIS Online portal and sharing knowledge through blogs and presentations.

Currently I work at BeoBOM, who have offered me a joined position, combining my degrees in history and GIS. Here I perform historical research for possible sites of WWII explosives and I analyse field data using GIS. 

The thing that my experience so far has taught me is also the thing I love most about working with GIS: it can be used in so many different fields for so many different things in so many different ways. I am up for any challenge presented to me and am very much looking forward to them!"

The focus of my current research is on late Nineteenth and Twentieth Century developments in mathematics and physics education at the secondary school level in the Netherlands, most notably involving the rise of new technology in educational practice (which involves history of AI, new media and computing most notably). I enjoy projects which take original source material into account and emphasise the broad cultural implications of science (education). Most noteworthy, I like using cartoons, novels, film footage, diary or college notes as (additional) source material, to illustrate the impact of certain developments in society. Currently, I'm writing a textbook on the ""where and why"" of mathematics during the past 2500 years.

In a former life I also worked as a consultant in special educational needs, in which role I advised both individuals and institutions. Students with special educational needs still are one of my soft spots. Thereby I follow this general guideline. Pupils and students with special educational needs are confronted with heavier tasks than other pupils and students. Acknowledging this fact does NOT imply that these students are best served by lightening their task. If they are capable of achieving the same goals as their fellow pupils and students, they should be allowed to develop themselves to their full potential; if not, teachers and educators should have the decency of showing these pupils and students a respectable alternative. It would be very helpful if educational institutions would pay more attention to the careers (ie: do these fit the certificates they obtained) of their former students, instead of focussing on the graduation of their present student population."

André Nijsen is the founding father of the SCM. From 1992 onwards he started developing methodologies for measuring the compliance costs of regulation. In 1994 the first product was Mistral®, the forerunner of the SCM. In January 2003 he obtained his PhD at the Erasmus University Rotterdam. The title of his thesis is: ""Dancing with the Octopus; Information obligations of enterprises in the social constitutional state from a public administration point of view."" Mistral® is one of the corner stones of this thesis. In 2005/6 he developed a new module of the SCM to measure the compliance costs of substantive obligations for enterprises, called SIROCCO, Scanning Instrument on Regulations for Other Compliance Costs. 

Besides this theoretical work, André Nijsen has a lot of practical experience in implementing the SCM in so-called base line measurements in all policy areas. He was involved in all Dutch base line measurements (2002 and 2007). He did countless SCM projects on separate laws and regulations in the Netherlands and in other countries.

André Nijsen has a lot of (inter)national experience as an adviser in the field of regulatory reform. He advised national governments in e.g. the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, South-Africa, Belgium, Slovenia, Dubai, Luxemburg, Germany, Austria, Romania and Kazakhstan. He also advised the European Commission, EUROSTAT, the OECD and the World Bank Group. André Nijsen also has experience in training officials in the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, South Africa, Slovenia, Luxemburg, Germany, Austria, Montenegro, Albania and Serbia with the application of impact assessments in the field of administrative burdens (compliance costs assessments).

I specialize in leveraging data, models, and new technologies for evidence-based decision-making on climate resilience and sustainable water management worldwide. Currently, I serve as a Senior Hydrologist and Climate Change Expert, also holding the role of Project Manager at FutureWater in the Netherlands. I lead international projects on flood forecasting, drought risk assessment, climate change impacts on water resources, and integrated water resources management.

💼🎓 Expertise & Impact 💼🎓
With a Ph.D. from Vrije Universiteit (VU) Amsterdam, my research focused on modeling hydroclimatic extremes, providing a strong foundation for my career. I've contributed significantly to cutting-edge climate and hydrological research at ICIMOD, Practical Action Consulting, VU, KNMI, and FutureWater. My expertise extends to water-food-energy systems, enriching my understanding of the intricate nexus between these essential resources.

🚀 Project Leadership 🚀
As a skilled Project Manager, I've led teams in developing flood forecasting systems, assessing climate change impacts on water, agriculture, energy, and water supply, and using machine learning for drought risk forecasting. My projects span diverse regions, including Nepal, Netherlands, India, Spain, Italy, Mozambique, Myanmar, China, UK, Germany, Laos, Tajikistan, and offline work in Georgia, Uzbekistan, Indonesia, and Colombia.

🌐 Global Training Experience 🌐
I take pride in being a seasoned trainer and capacity builder. Through workshops on hydrological modeling, climate risk assessment, and geospatial analysis, I've empowered professionals in Nepal, Myanmar, China, India, Mozambique, Laos, Tajikistan, and beyond to address water management and climate change challenges with innovative solutions.

I grabbed the opportunity to move from Los Angeles to Thailand before being asked to join a team in Dubai, where I met my French wife with whom I traveled around the world to more than 40 countries with before we settled in Amsterdam.

Since graduating with a BA in Visual Journalism from the Brooks Institute in California in 2010, I have worked professionally as a production manager, creative producer, video editor, videographer and project manager while working with teams in the USA, Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.

I gained diverse knowledge and experiences in various areas including risk management, project/change management, impact investing, CDD/KYC, business development, retail & SME banking, microfinance.

As a great connecter I like to match solutions to problems and overcome challenges. I can easily learn a new subject, initiate and take charge of a new project or an initiative. I am good at cross-functional collaboration and project work. My enthusiasm, down-to-earth mentality and perseverance enable me to get things done.

Nowadays companies in all industries are facing digital transformation, increasing competition and tougher regulation. They must adopt quickly to stay relevant and ahead of competition in a rapidly evolving environment. Over the past decade, I have been focusing on risk management and earned a couple of risk management certifications. Among my projects, I conducted a number of risk management assessments of financial institutions as a PRMIA’s certified independent institutional assessor in risk management by summarizing how they scored on strategic, governance, credit, financial and operational risks and consequently, guided them to improve their risk management system. In the period of 2018 – 2019, I served as a Deputy Chairperson of the PRMIA’s member-led working group that was formed to discuss and work on operational risk in Microfinance. 

So I can help companies to implement a systematic risk management approach to cope with challenges of transformation, growth and regulation complexity. I believe that my wealth of knowledge and experience would make me a valuable asset to many businesses seeking an expert in risk management. 

I am currently working as a consultant at PROX6 – a Dutch consulting company. Feel free to reach out to me via Linkedin to discuss how I can add value to your business.

My first migration journey as a baby resulted into a life-long balancing act between identities; this triggered an innate curiosity of everything that was different. I fell in love with personal storytelling when I was 11 years old and read The Diary Of Anne Frank for the first time. Since then, ‘Storylistening’ became my tool to discover and learn from the world around me.

I spent my first few adult years travelling the world before I decided to formalise my education through a bachelor degree in Communication and a Master in Politics of Global Development in Australia. My personal journey led to to work with international migration across four continents with local NGOs, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency and IOM - UN Migration. But dissatisfied with the current personal and global narratives about migration, encouraged me to found Pocket Stories to connect people with unheard voices through storytelling to embrace and accept diversity. 

Listening to and recording hundreds of personal stories from around the world has helped me to better understand how we are all interconnected, not in spite of, but because of human migration. We all have profound stories to tell. You and your stories are not alone. All our stories belongs in a much larger story, our shared collective story.

I've always had a drive to perform, an eagerness to learn and the talent to dream. I learned how to read at the age of 4 and skipped a year in primary school, which made me the smallest person at virtually all occasions until adulthood. Ironically, I also played national league basketball. Eventually got two university degrees and started working in M&A (CFCM) at ABN ARMO. After a couple of years of valuable high speed learning, I realised that I want to do what makes sense in the broader context; working on a mission that both contributes to and transcends my own and organizational goals. Combining the brain work with the heart work. And that is exactly what I am doing at FMO - the Dutch development bank.

Things I value in the work area: being professional, kind, courageous, decisive and responsible. I actively support training people's ability to reflect on their behavior and developing their emotional intelligence, resilience and personal leadership, as I believe these are increasingly important skills in our rapidly changing and dynamic world.

In May 2006, I decided to leave Cisco for Juniper, where I worked as a Premier Account Engineer for broadband solutions and later (end 2007) for core. In May 2011 I was promoted to Escalation Engineer for broadband solutions.

In september 2012, still within Juniper, I moved to a software engineering group, tasked with maintaing service cards for MX platforms. This was a fully self-contained, embedded platform that had me working at a fairly low level (as an example, I had to write a heurestic stack unwind for mips) as well as application level (carrier grade NAT was the main use for those cards).

In 2016, I was assigned to take care of LACP common code, which involved a fair amount of embedded work again (I was tasked to move LACP pdus transmission to the hardware, so-called ""inlining"") and some BSD kernel work.

Since 2019 I have been the lead engineer responsible for implementing TWAMP and RPM on Junos EVO from scratch for various platforms and bringing those to feature parity with legacy Junos.

Networking:
- Double CCIE (Cisco Certified Internetworking Engineer #12987) for the Routing and Switching as well as Service Provider tracks, with excellent knowledge of IOS.
- JNCIE-SP (#1466) and JNCIP-E (#97) certifications, with excellent knowledge of Junos and JunosE..
- Experience in most relevant networking protocols (routing, management) as well as in designing, maintaining and troubleshooting networks.

General Skills:
- Voice over IP (founder of www.myglobalconference.com)

Across my 20+ years of international and cross-sector experiences in futures research, transformational strategy, grassroots conservation, and sustainability communications, I have applied my superpowers to:
- Cultivate enhanced visibility for both UN and World Bank global environment programmes that boosted on-the-ground implementation and helped to inform policy-making processes at the national, regional and global level;
- Equip an innovation charity in the UK with fresh off-the-press future sustainability disruption trends that enabled organisational and strategic repositioning for the next 10 years;
- Inspire national and global policymakers to apply nature-based climate solutions to boost global biodiversity restoration efforts which contribute to the SDGs and the UN decade of Landscape Restoration;
- Build high-impact strategic communications capability across multiple companies and organisations to better engage their target audiences and shift the needle of behaviour change;
- Boost investor interest for sustainability-driven startups through impact branding and smart positioning.	

Today I capture all this experience in a unique offering that delivers real transformation and sustainable change. Depending on the size of the project, I also regularly collaborate with my network of of awesome sustainability thinkers, strategists, creatives, futurists, storytellers, trend researchers, designers, trainers and facilitators to help me deliver the transformation required that then helps you drive the sustainability movement and be known for it.

I’ve lived and worked in Costa Rica, Panama, Switzerland, Spain, Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Tanzania. I currently live in the Netherlands. When I’m not working on organisational transformation, I enjoy devouring information about human connection, personal growth and somatic healing as well as immersing myself in the wilderness to disconnect, recharge and reconnect.

Blijvende, toekomstige betrokkenheid spreekt vanzelf. In mijn rol als bestuurder zet ik in op het ontwikkelen van een strategie, procesbegeleiding om in gezamenlijkheid, in verbinding, een eindresultaat te kunnen behalen of een beweging te kunnen bewerkstelligen.

Can we make nations less dependent on official development assistance or address root causes for youth unemployment (leading to large-scale migration)?

I believe the answers to many of these are sustainable economic development, with emphasis on job creation and local value-adding enterprise development. 
 
Profit is not a single bottom line! Economics of mutuality considers benefits of companies investing in its communities, people and environmental system.

If we help create an enabling environment, build people’s capacities with marketable skills and support local enterprise development, then more people in the BOP can earn a living wage. And by helping them develop their sustainable livelihood, they will increasingly be able to provide for their families, educate their children, access health care, etc. I believe this should arise from business development and job creation, using market based approaches and agricultural value chains.

note: there is an obious difference between could be, should be and want to be. At the current point in my career, technical leadership is more of interest than pure development. Sure, I will do whatever the situation might require, but technical leadership in a position that requires insight and can drive innovation, leading to practical solutions would be the most optimal use of my talents and potential .

I am  very gifted in the ability to translate technical jargon into executive and workfloor-friendly metaphors and vice-versa.

This technical prowess is coupled with an ability to formulate solutions to any problem on short-term, middle to long term, taking into account the business context (budget, time, material, resources).

This also means that I have a strong knowledge and theoretical background of algorithms, and I am an accomplished programmer in languages like C, C++ and Java, and can adapt to and learn new technology in a very short amount of time.

I have the ability to motivate people and nudge them gently out of their comfort zone. I am a leader by consensus, meaning that all team members are equally important, and each opinion is weighed on the base of its own merit. When tough decision have to be made, I am not afraid to make them. 

Bottom-Line: I am a Solution Provider, where Solutions take into account the complete context, rather than just the technical. For me, it is not a matter of thinking outside the box. I was not thinking in terms of boxes to begin with. I will tell you like it is - or how I perceive it is, what the dangers and risks are of any given proposal and I will leave the decisionmaking based on my assessments to you. Unless of course you delegate the decision-making to me.

Member of DNHK - German-Dutch Chamber of Commerce. 

➡️ Along with my partners, I have recruited exceptional digital leaders, sales and business development executives for my clients in Benelux and German speaking countries.  Have helped many Dutch companies with their expansion and recruitment needs for Top Talent in Germany.

Get in touch with me if you recognise my values:

✅	You need an expert recruiter, who understands your challenges and provides a consultative no-nonsense approach.
✅	You need a committed search specialist; not a generalist recruiter, who does not give you any exclusivity.
✅	You do not want to limit yourself to the small percentage of active candidates, but want your vacancy filled by the best candidates, who typically do not look at any job posts. 
✅	As a candidate, if you are looking for a new position or just need you need an unbiased career advice. I know the market and work with some of the best companies.

MY BACKGROUND

I am fluent in English, German, Russian and Dutch (native) and feel privileged to have lived and worked in different countries before, such as in Germany, Nordics, Baltics and Russia. I understood long ago that that the most valuable asset of any team and company lies directly in its people. I naturally gravitated towards executive recruitment - finding and attracting the best talent is what I love doing since many years. I have become a valued trusted advisor for my clients and take pride into the fact that I managed to complete over 350 hard- to- fill (international) search assignments so far.

Outside of work, you'll find me either at a squash court; football pitch or I am engaged in some other sort of outdoor activity.  Oh.. and my passion is wine – in 2019 I managed to visit 25 French wine castles.  ☺"

My name is Elena 🙋🏻‍♀️ I was born and raised in Russia. 

Because of my job, I moved to Germany in 2017, and love brought me to the Netherlands in 2019. Moving comes with challenges, also from a professional point of view. E.g. learning and adjusting to different business environments and cultures. These changes helped me develop my professional skills. Throughout my career, I gained experience mostly in b2b sales & customer support, where I assisted the international sales team by:
- coordinating activities and handling deadlines (time management);
- contacting customers worldwide (advanced level business English);
- managing data in CRM and ERP software (key user);
- and ensuring smooth day-to-day operations. 

My analytical skills, creativity and problem-solving abilities helped me identify possible customers’ objections and find mutually beneficial solutions for all stakeholders involved.

I have Dutch nationality. And currently, I live with my partner and our sons in Enschede, Netherlands. My Dutch level (speaking and understanding) is B1-level. 

What I started learning at my University (specialising in International Relations) is benefitting me today:
- about different cultures
- values
- and beliefs. 

It helped me become the person I am today: adjusting, tolerant, open-minded and curious. Mostly curious about new tech and the latest software solutions (ChatGPT, AI).

Consider a world where we no longer listen to the loudest expert but instead to the person with the best data-driven explanation — an explanation that is verifiable because it is based on open-source intelligence (OSINT).

Our Vision: To change the way policy and business decisions are made in an information-rich world.
To move towards that vision, we started tracking a country with which we at Datenna are most familiar: China.

Our Mission: We empower organisations to eliminate the information gap they have [with China] by providing the best [China] OSINT software.

I define myself as a diplomat-turned-entrepreneur. After having worked at the Dutch Embassy in Beijing and Consulate in Shanghai and lived there for 12+ years, I decided to move back to the Netherlands and founded Datenna, the world leading provider of economic intelligence on China.

At Datenna, we are building a new way to conduct Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT). Through our automated and AI-assisted algorithms, we are supporting governments worldwide in conducting in-depth research on the Chinese industry, innovation, and academia in an efficient and reliable fashion.

Before founding the company, I had been tracking China’s technological and economic development for 15 years. During my time in China, I visited 1000+ Chinese companies, government organizations, and research institutes, where I dealt with topics as diverse as stem cells, nuclear energy, 5G, big data, and semiconductors. Since I could not keep track of all Chinese technological and scientific progresses, I started Datenna: a company that mixes software engineering and data science with China expertise.

On a personal level, I am a technology enthusiast by nature and a software engineer by education. Besides sciences, I have a soft spot for human factors and psychology/sociology. How is technology changing us? How is it going to change us? And how can we influence the direction and speed of technological progress?"

After graduating from business school with a specialization in Asian Business Studies, moving to China, the land of opportunities, to start my career was an obvious step to take. During my studies I followed an exchange program in Beijing at UIBE (对外经济贸易大学), and did a work-placement in Chengdu. Knowing the difference between first and second tier China first-hand gave me a clear preference for the latter; the ‘real’ China.

China has always interested me: its long history, its fast growth, the differences with my own culture and the personal way of doing business. It's the land of opportunities, but also a land with many pitfalls. As an organization and a person you have to always be ready to adapt to China’s fast changing environment. Knowing your own business is not enough; you need to know the local differences, challenges and possibilities and translate your business plan accordingly. In these times you need to ‘think global, but act local’.

During my studies and time living in China I have built up my knowledge of both international business theory and Chinese practice. I have experienced a broad education with an Asian perspective, studying subjects like Strategic Management, Organizational Theory, Marketing, Finance, Budgeting, Asian Management, Chinese and Statistics. 

This skill set helps me to lead a varied range of projects and consult on many different aspects of doing business in China. Furthermore, during my studies and working experiences I developed analytical and planning skills, which help me evaluate situations over a short timeframe and come up with lasting solutions. I am well acquainted with working in international teams and with people from different professions to solve a problem. 

After living in China for over 7 years I have decided to move back to The Netherlands with my family. Utilizing my experience and expertise to function as a bridge between China and Europe."

Keeping self-challenge is never easy but it makes me become a better version of myself. After nine years of working as a contract and commercial manager in the telecommunication sector, I changed my career to banking industry and became a KYC officer. It was proved by fact that I had made a right decision.

I believe in never stop learning. It is my way to explore and experience the world, spiritually and physically. So to me, learning is not just about courses, training and reading. It is also about to know and understand different people, to travel and discover a new city, and to take in different cultures. All those ways helped me to become who am I and to the “Me” I like.

He dicovered a large number of DNA variants and epigenomic markers highly informative for accurate prediction of human appearance traits; his work laid the foundation for two DNA test systems for predicting eye color and hair color, which are already in use for forensic and anthropological applications internationally. He has published over 80 scientific articles on SCI journals including over 20 first/corresponding author papers published on journals such as Nat Genet, Am J Hum Genet, eLife, Curr Bio, PLoS Genet, Hum Mol Genet, Hum Genet, and Forensic Sci Int Genet.

As part of my employment at the Beijing Institute of Genomics Chinese Academy of Sciences (BIG), in 1st July, 2017, I started to collaborate with scientists from the Beijing Institute of Forensic Sciences, Chinese Ministry of Public Security. This scientific collaboration concerned statistical analyses of genomic and epigenomic data my group at BIG carried out. These data were provided to my group at BIG by the Institute of Forensic Sciences as part of this scientific collaboration. The samples from which these data were generated had been collected by the Institute of Forensic Sciences. After the collaborative papers had been published, this scientific collaboration was discontinued from my side in May, 2019."

I'm currently studying Economics& Business Economics Bachelor's degree at Groningen University in the Netherlands. 

As an Economics & Business Economics student at Groningen University, I have gained valuable skills in financial accounting, statistical analysis using SPSS, business report writing, and Excel. I am particularly interested in the fields of financial accounting, business management, and financial advisory.

Living in a foreign country has taught me the value of independence and adaptability. During my time in Groningen, I have also actively sought out opportunities to develop my skills through various student association committees and board positions. In my role as treasurer of ESN, the largest student association in Groningen, I enhanced my finance skills and developed an interest in the field.

Through my involvement in three different student associations, including serving as a student representative for my program, I have gained valuable experience in communication, event management, budgeting, and marketing. These experiences have broadened my horizons and equipped me with a range of skills that I believe will be valuable in any professional context.

I am now seeking opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge in the fields of financial accounting, business management, and financial advisory. I am open to exploring roles in a variety of industries and settings and am excited to take on new challenges and opportunities. Please don't hesitate to get in touch if you believe my skills and experiences align with your organization's needs.

Although, it took me years before realising that my inner struggle of acceptance was in the way of my own personal transformation. An intense self-discovery journey back to South Korea catalysed that process.

Over the years, I have been blessed to work with both the NGO and corporate sector. These different environments have shaped my beliefs on leadership and life balance. Today I get paid to kick people’s butts so they turn their good intentions into real behavioural change, and use my voice as a spoken word artist to confront audiences with prejudices and unconscious biases they didn’t even know they had.

During my academic development, I worked closely with clinicians from Erasmus Medical Center and the Amsterdam University Medical Center to design connected care solutions based on data and human-centered design.

My design process is driven by empathy built within user research and the connections between the user and its context. I am skilled at online text analytics and user-centered design methods and tools to deliver research-based insights. I enjoy facilitating creative and co-creation sessions and follow an iterative approach that makes me embrace success and failure as part of my learning experience. These practices enable me to conceptualise and develop innovative and feasible propositions that result in value-driven integrated solutions.

I am a pro-active team player that believes a positive attitude is contagious. I feel comfortable working in a multicultural environment and enjoy creating a trustworthy atmosphere to improve collaboration. Additionally, working in healthcare has made me understand clinician’s mindsets and medical terminology, enhancing my persuasion and communication skills to inspire others in a multidisciplinary setting.

I see great opportunities for creating a systemic change in healthcare by bringing data science and human-centered design techniques together. Do you see the same? Feel free to send me an invitation on Linkedin to discuss the topic further!"

Having made a transition from Albania/Kosovo to the EU Netherlands now, I am actively engaged in pursuing my next career move.  My extensive background in working for state and local governmental entities, as well as NGOs, gives me a solid basis and skillset that can be applied in a variety of roles.    

The Western Balkans, synonymous with turmoil, is where I have built a career spanning over two decades.  My primary roles have involved fostering governance and democratization within this highly volatile region. It goes without saying, that success within the Balkans requires a broad skillset to work in difficult, stressful and tense situations.  Over the years, I have honed my skills, which directly contributed to the success of my endeavors and earned the respect among professionals peers and not only.

My unique professional experience and background gives me a worldly perspective that I look forward to sharing in my next role.  By nature, I am motivated, enthusiastic, proactive, communicative, and more importantly, ethical.  I love to learn and do not shy away from any challenge.  I pursue all that I do with passion, dedication and commitment to the ultimate end goal.  

I am currently looking for a position that enables me to relay the professional experience but certainly enabling me to learn from the work I will be doing as I truly believe that every job is a stepping stone to career learning and further professional development.

We represent entrepreneurs who, while operating their business activities, simultaneously remove carbon from the atmosphere while at the same time helping companies to reduce their CO2 emissions.
The goal? To reverse global warming, allow our planet to heal and create life!

I have been working in the field of various forms of sustainability for over 20 years. with the aim of creating win-win relationships between the fortunate and less fortunate, the wealthy and the less wealthy. This symbiotic relationship benefits everyone, and above all our planet.

This passion drove me to co-founding Outdoor Albania, where I helped local isolated farmers in rural mountains to create an income by hosting tourists. 
Among other benefits it gave me the opportunity to help local tourism suppliers to gain access to selling their tourism services on the internet.

I remember a conversation I had with a rural self-sustainable farmer who lived in a small village in Northern Albania and how I tried to explain what the internet was. “Like an invisible book with pages in the air, which everyone with a computer can read”  

So, when I was asked by Climate Cleanup if I wanted to join their mission in reversing climate change, It didn't take me long to decide to join them and contribute to their mission;

“Removing CO2 from the atmosphere by doubling nature”- It’s as simple as that!

Almost the same as the times when I was trying to inform local Albanian farmers what the internet was, after all this entire voluntary carbon market hasn't been around for a long time. And many people need help with understanding these concepts. We are helping to do this.

All our projects are accredited by ONCRA, store carbon and create additional benefits related to the millennium development goals. 

If you would like to know more on suitable projects for your nature based carbon credit purchases while being able to establish a personal relationship with these entrepreneurs or just get a better understanding between Onsets or Offsets I would love to connect.

I also loved numbers. I was cool with numbers. 
As a young international student in Electronic Engineering in Genoa, Italy, I loved learning about the importance of human relationships and caring, resilient communities.
As a McDonald's manager, I genuinely learned about leadership, team dynamics, and customers' needs. After my Bachelor's, I found myself in daily contact with staff, inventory, and sales data. I enjoyed it. Nevertheless, my numbers-loving brain didn't collaborate 100% during my Horeca experience. I realize I felt no magic about it. Something was missing. 
The reason?
There had never been an underlying, greater PURPOSE in seeking my degree. The degree was the goal, an empty one. Also, my natural drive as a people person and a proactive thinker often lacked real, game-changing inspiration to make me thrive at work. 
What happened then?
In 2019, I took a sabbatical to help my wife and our two children settle in our current hometown, Amsterdam. I slowly dove into sustainability and acquired deep awareness regarding its challenges. I started to scratch the surface on the adaptation, mitigation, and regenerative strategies through online resources.
Ultimately, my Master's in Environment and Resource Management was the enlightening experience I needed:
I enjoyed and found inspiration from the content.
I felt great satisfaction from my projects & final thesis.
I spoke to Data, and Data spoke back to me 😊.
I significantly improved my writing.
I met incredible people with similar, profound sustainability aspirations. 
From being a kid in a small Albanian town to a grown, family man in Amsterdam, I connected the dots:
The complexity and interconnectedness of the problems we face globally require us to take a holistic, multidisciplinary approach. It also has to build around inclusiveness and diversity, and ultimately, it comes all to People. As collaborative stewards of communities, neighbors, and the planet, we People, will change the World. How great would it be if we started by being KIND & HONEST to each other and HOPEFUL about the future?

Beyond any doubt, I know my WHY: I want to help businesses transform into sustainable enterprises through DATA & COLLABORATION: Let's persevere together towards the future! I am a (biased) dad to two amazing children, so WE NEED ACTION! NOW!

P.S. I am skilled and would love to improve further:

Being a quantitative economist who provides evidence-based insights to clients means a lot of things.

In addition, you must be able to translate the quantitative insights from your model into key messages and recommendations that help your clients – here good communication skills are quite handing. Last, but not least, you need to be a good project manager to make sure that your findings reach your clients on time and according to their standards.

Since the completion of my Ph.D. (a decade ago), I have been given the opportunity of working as a quantitative economist for several organisations (Cambridge Econometrics, UK; Ecorys, The Netherlands) on a variety of fields: labour market, housing, social domain, telecom, social accountability, energy, agriculture, environment, etc.

I’m an Industrial engineer (Master) with a second degree in Industrial Control and Automatic Regulation whose specificity of double dregree is sought-after by French company for the knowledge of the candidate in Instrumentation & Controls but also for his good understanding of the needs from the field technician to the high management which was a key point at the beginning of my career.

Very young, I had my first experience in an international environment in French Guiana (south America) through an internship at the Guyana Space Center.
The excitement to live the launch of an Ariane 5 rocket confirmed my willing to become an engineer and pursue an international career.

After a first Oil & Gas experience in Côte D’Ivoire, I was selected, to the most thrilling experience of my young career on an Oil Platform Project in South Korea. I was the contact point between the local team and the high management who remained in Paris. 

Back to France and freshly graduated from my engineering school, I didn’t hesitate to accept a technician position to gain field experience during the maintenance outage of a chemical plant. 

Shortly after, I took off for Saudi Arabia to take the lead of the Electrical Substations maintenance. 
I developed there my Ability to work in an international environment with a multidisciplined and multicultural team and had carte blanche to improve the organisation with the implementation of a new software.

After two years in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, I came back to France in the intent of developing my knowledge in Instrumentation on an engineering phase which I had the chance to do at Siemens Energy on Gas Compressors for projects in Norway and Algeria / Spain.

I recently had the opportunity to approach the contractual aspect on instrumentation for the Nuclear Hinkley Point C project in England.

""I can't change the direction of the wind, but I can adjust my sails to always reach my destination."" 

My work principles:
- Some see change as a problem, I see change as an opportunity.
- Adapting to evolving trends and the always changing regulations in the food and packaging industry is 
  what I know for.
- I am driven to find the right solution to the most technically challenging problems and I am only satisfied  
  when I reach the desired result.

Summary:
I started working in 1995 in the food industry (see the various food companies where I've worked). In my opinion I was experienced enough to start my own business, so I did. Personally, I consider myself as an easy going and open-minded person. I like the aspects of dynamic work. Such as leading a project in the process & packaging industry (dry blending and end of line packaging).

My key activities and deliverables are: 
Project Management & Engineering (GAMP STAGE), FED (Front end Design), User Requirement Specification (URS). Commissioning: FAT-SAT : IQ ,OQ, PQ and start-up manager.

Let me expand a bit on each:

Because I’m passionate about designing holistic structures, I launched my own technical blog, write articles on LinkedIn/Wordpress and publish papers to share my expertise in Structural Integrity Management, brownfield projects development, advance calculation methods, scientific discoveries and tools, concept development, sustainability ratings, multi-discipline coordination, construction methods and material handling to make a positive difference in the community. This also helps me to stay current with developments while challenging assumptions and transferring skills to others to navigate new paths and to integrate Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) into the structural design business DNA.

I believe in bringing human energy into hybrid work skills while networking and collaborating with engineering colleagues, environmentalists, Professors, researchers and industry leaders to deliver best-in class solutions and fix loopholes. I support and empower multi-discipline engineers, project and construction managers to pursue success and deliver consistently on numerous world-class fast-track projects while mentoring engineers to help the energy industry move to a more sustainable and balanced future.

For the past 20+ years, I have worked with multiple Clients, Class Societies, Marine Warranty Surveyors, fabricators, shipyards, sub-contractors, operators, universities, software and numerous Company standards, international codes and standards while working in multilingual offices in South and SE Asia, Middle East, Europe and Americas in several international roles. This has given me a global perspective and helped me to strengthen my skills, imagination to solve tomorrow’s problems today, value other’s opinion and expertise to face and reflect bigger challenges and identify new trends.

I am always interested in hearing and exploring new challenges from energy professionals, engineers, book publishers, clients, partners, researchers and entrepreneurs, as well as renewable and technology developers. Please contact me via InMail."

I particularly enjoy working with clients and stakeholders to deliver complex briefs where no previous precedent existed including in remote and regional areas of Western Australia.

An example is the $30m Lime Street crisis and aged care facility. A first for Western Australia, the project provides an integrated accommodation model including dementia specific aged-care, crisis and transitional accommodation supported by onsite support services. Completed in 2013, the building was an immediate success as a vibrant new community for the formerly homeless and their service providers. The project received the Australian Institute of Architects (WA) Harold Krantz Award for Multi-Residential Architecture, and two UDIA WA Awards for Excellence including the Presidents Award and Sustainable Urban Development Award.

In 2018, as project director and design leader, I assisted SwanCare in designing the first purpose designed, ‘whole of building approach’ to dementia care. With a budget of $34m, I worked closely with their executive team and operational staff to design a facility that would seamlessly accommodate both individual and elderly couples requiring different levels of dementia and high care living.

More recently, in 2021 I worked as a subject matter expert to develop the design for the new secure Delirium Ward at Sir Charles Gardiner Hospital. It has been a resounding success for staff, patients and visiting families alike with patients transitioning with ease to their new environment. Staff have reported significant reductions in safety incidents, which were previously occurring daily, with no reported code blacks in the first four weeks.

I am currently undertaking a Churchill fellowship, researching the latest designs from the UK, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands looking at how psychiatric wards can be humanised. In particular, I will look at evidence-based design features that reduce incidents of seclusion & suicide and improve staff safety as well as patient outcomes."

Using highly theatrical and cinematic methods, she re-imagines histories and classical texts, creating alternative readings that question the conditions of the construction of dominant narratives that shape Western society. Her Argentinean background, and upbringing in Australia, Argentina, and Brunei Darussalam – all settler states and/or former colonies or protectorates – feed into her practice.

Her solo exhibition, 'Only Weeds Emerge', opened at TENT Rotterdam in late 2018. More recently, her work exhibited at at The National: New Australian Art at the Art Gallery of NSW, curated by Isobel Parker Philip; and 'Into the Open', presented by Te Papa for New Zealand Festival.

Too many marginalised groups are being subjected to human rights abuses around the world. My work has been to develop rights-based strategies and models and promote change.

I am passionate about working practically to see the principles of international human rights implemented nationally, regionally and internationally, building on my extensive experience on refugee, asylum seeker, statelessness, migrant, LGBTIQ+ and indigenous programs and policy issues globally.

With 20 years of leadership experience in not-for-profit management and governance across 50 countries, my expertise lies in developing strategies for change and organizational development and in advising and problem-solving with civil society, governments and UN bodies.

I am the Head of Advocacy for the the Institute on Statelessness and Inclusion (ISI) which is the first and the only human rights NGO dedicated to promoting the right to a nationality and the rights of stateless people globally. I am also on the Taskforce of The Global Alliance to End Statelessness, a UNHCR initiative that seeks to accelerate solutions to statelessness through a collective multi stakeholder approach, which centres those who are stateless and formerly stateless.

I was the previous Executive Director of Nationality for All, a regional NGO working to advance the rights of people affected by statelessness in the Asia-Pacific region, and was the Executive Director of the International Detention Coalition for 10 years, and a recent fellow at the Centre for Asia Pacific Refugee Studies (CAPRS) at the University of Auckland

I am a social anthropologist and recently completed my doctoral degree with a focus on how civil society can effectively engage governments for rights-based policy change.  

The model of effective engagement I developed as part of this research was called “ a new, original, and potentially life-changing contribution”, and that the research has the “potential to make such an important contribution to how we might understand this particular approach to bringing about policy change”.

My work ahead is to explore supporting communities and civil society groups in their human rights advocacy work using this framework.

My achievements include the Australian Human Rights Award in 2002, and was nominated for the 2004 French Human Rights Prize and the 2017 Trust Law Awards for my work with vulnerable groups in detention.

I am passionate about all things heritage and most importantly the people at its core. I enjoy working with Traditional Owners and members of the public and I am a strong believer in listening and learning from others first.

My Honours project focused on a Fremantle Convict-Colonial mental Asylum (1864-1909), and investigated the potential for former patients to enact agency within a total institution that retrogressed it’s operations from modern therapeutic approach, to punitive holding ground.  

I achieved this by synchronising extensive historical research with archaeological fieldwork at the former Asylum, spatially and functionally analysing material evidence and graffiti left behind in the former isolation area. 

Two seperate excavations, in the former yard and underfloor in one remaining cell revealed an array of evidence manifesting as subversive behaviours and coping mechanisms among others, consistent with punitive penal institutions such as prisons, rather than a mental health facility designed to rehabilitate. 

Although I have a particular interest in historical archaeology, I am also passionate about Australian Indigenous heritage, Traditional Owner knowledge and their ancestral right to have a leading voice in its preservation.

A harmonic work environment is for me the basis of enabling my team and me to be as productive as possible. In that sense going the extra mile for my stakeholders than also comes as a desire and the result of following the example of the people around me and leading by example myself.

- As a Conflict Resolution Facilitator I create environments of trust and respect. I help stuck negotiating parties re-engage in dialogue to move from frustrating compromises to empowered win-win solutions. 

- After 30 years experience I am considered a thought leader in European law enforcement.

- Increasingly complex threats need a different kind of policing.  Most common approaches only focus on increasing budget, staff count, skill level and equipment.

- I believe that a deeper understanding of our connectedness as one humanity fosters international cooperation based on trust and common goals.

-  Internal power struggles and trust issues amongst competing national interests often hinder the effectiveness of policing. As a Conflict Resolution Facilitator I bring awareness to these issues.

• WHAT DIFFERENTIATES ME FROM OTHER CONFLICT RESOLUTION FACILITATORS? 

- In nearly all my roles in the European Law Enforcement over the last 3 decades I'm known as a 'bridge builder' - as someone who can bring people and often disparate opinions and points of view together. 

- My sensitivity for the individuals' needs alongside the organisational road maps has allowed me to facilitate fast and surprising turnarounds in often difficult, stuck environments. 

- This is not only a gift or an instinct, it is something I've consciously honed and strengthened over the years through studies not only in traditional organisational change management but also in psychology and personal development. 

- This still novel approach of honouring not only the mind, but also the body (physicality) and emotions makes my work very effective and creates repeatable and predictable results, respecting equally the emotional wellbeing of the individuals and teams alongside the organisation's interests.

Their creative work should cultivate self-exploration and their connection to the world around them.

The last two years I focused on enriching my upper school art teacher 'toolbelt' at ArtEZ in the Netherlands. I completed a second bachelor's degree, this time in Art Education. My graduation thesis investigated the influence of technology on the human psyche. My aim was to develop my own philosophy about the conscientious use of technology in art. I wanted to design an updated teaching format that maintains standards and benchmarks, while nurturing innovation and exploration. 

The foundation of this format uses the Elements of Art and the Principals of Design as the building blocks of a fully integrated cross curricular art program and asks for investigative research, as well as the development of analogue and digital techniques. Through the integrated use of contemporary and traditional art tools, students can produce work that is reflective of the world they are growing up in. My hope is to continue to experiment with these ideas within a team of art educators at a student centered progressive educational institution."

Furthermore, she is the Founder of 'collaborACE' - a website that offers both GCSE students and teachers the opportunity to freely view and use subject-specific notes, improving access to education amongst students; this platform has expanded internationally and, according to Google Analytics, has users from over 3 continents and 13 countries.

In 2022, Isabel authored a systematic literature review research paper, ""Evaluation of Helminthic Therapy as a Treatment for Autoimmune Diseases""; which was peer-reviewed by a panel of professionals and published by 'The International Young Researchers' Conference.' (In partnership with the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons Global Health Organization)

The Group has faced many challenges in the past but it only made us more determined to expand our operations in all three countries. As a part of expansion, the Group has recently successfully acquired companies in Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and the Kingdom of Bahrain, which were merged with local operating entities, which are now one of the top companies in their respective markets.
As the global market is changing with disruptions from new entrants with the adoption of new technologies, the Group as a whole took significant strides towards bringing the DID (Differentiate, Innovate, Disrupt) strategy to fruition. Surrounded by a fast changing technological landscape where new technologies and young start-ups are upending incumbent market leaders and business models, the Group has embarked on a digital transformation journey that has the customer at its heart.
In addition to above, the Group is also engaged in constant dialogue with start-ups in the MENA region and worldwide in order to explore potential partnerships, with the latter working on innovative technologies such as robotic process automation, big data analytics and artificial intelligence. With the emergence of Solidarity Bahrain as a leading player in the Kingdome of Bahrain, supported by consistently strong performance of Solidarity Jordan and continuous strides by Solidarity Saudi to achieve critical mass in the largest MENA Insurance Market, the Group is well poised to continue its robust performance in the future.

I'm a Digital Marketer with a global perspective and with over seven years of Marketing experience in Sri Lanka and The Netherlands (combined).  My passions, experiences, and personal growth drive me to deliver impactful strategies that elevate brands and connect with audiences worldwide. 

Originally from Sri Lanka, I've been fortunate to call Dubai, Bahrain, and Sri Lanka my homes before embarking on my current adventure to The Netherlands. As a Third Culture Kid, I embrace the richness of different cultures, making every journey a colourful exploration.

In Sri Lanka, I've successfully managed diverse clients in Finance, Retail, FMCG, Education and Hospitality industries. As a team leader, I've nurtured a people-first approach, leading to award-winning projects that showcased our creativity and strategic thinking. 

In The Netherlands, my specialisation in social media led to exceptional growth, expanding the company's online community by an impressive 233% in just two years. My passion for social media strategy has driven me to deliver results and foster brand growth in diverse markets.

An avid learner, I've honed my skills through programs like the Spikes Digital Academy in Singapore and completing Digital Garage by Google. Spearheading the digital execution of a global campaign - Women of the World Festival in Sri Lanka and the What Now Project remains two of my proudest accomplishments, championing women's empowerment and gender equality.

Beyond my professional experience, I have a deep fondness for travelling and cooking. It ignites my sense of creativity, bringing joy and inspiration. Moreover, I'm a passionate advocate for animal welfare and nature conservation, finding solace in the company of animals and immersing myself in nature's beauty. 

Rooted in an empowered family of women, their support uplifts and inspires me, shaping both my personality and leadership approach.

Life's journey is a tapestry of strength and growth, where challenges become opportunities to rise. Overcoming PTSD taught me the art of healing and the power of my own will. This chapter in my life sparked a passion for uplifting others, embracing empathy and hope for those facing their own battles. It fills me with unwavering courage and a deep love for the beauty of constant growth, inspiring me to embrace each adventure with an open heart.

I'm excited to connect, collaborate, and make a positive impact in the digital landscape and beyond.

Let me break down the series of events that led to the person you are currently reading about today. From a very early age, problem solving has been a hobby and motivation that has constantly been an integral part of many decisions I’ve made in life. Starting from school, my love for math and science directed my interests to undertake a bachelor’s degree in engineering. I spent 4 years studying those areas of engineering that required problem solving though design and modeling, analytics, experiments and workshops. 

I secured my first job opportunity at Harris Pye as an instrumentation technician. The company specialized in engineering services - repairs and conversions in the marine, offshore oil and gas and associated onshore industries. Although the job profile was different and challenging from what I was specialized in, I saw it as an opportunity to diversify my knowledge in electrical engineering and operating systems. 

After a year of working at the docks in the Kingdom of Bahrain, I shifted my field of engineering once again. I secured an offer from STACK Group International, an intralogistics firm in Kuwait that hired me as the sales engineer for material handling equipment. It was from this point that my calling for Supply Chain and Logistics grew extensively. The guidance, and the experience gained there helped me build a bridge between engineering and management. In time, I started to realize that this job extruded the perfect use of my skill set and personality combined. 

However, as every sector or industry advances with technology, science and innovation, a more advanced skill set and knowledge base is required to foresee and overcome the challenges posed at the time. To achieve this, I enrolled myself at the University of Groningen and got accepted to study Industrial Engineering and Management (Specializing in Product Technology and Logistics). 

On successfully completing my Master’s Degree, I have secured a position at PVH Corp., as the Material Strategy Analyst of the Supply Value Chain Business Unit.

I feel that these shape the foundation that allow development and sophistication to flourish. The last couple of years, I have focused much on the energy industry across the width of the whole power space. Having worked in the Oil & Gas sector and later on moving on to cleantech, I understand the potential of a diversified energy mix. After this, I also took on a role of diplomat for the Govt of India, that allowed me to understand the profound connection between government and corporate and by extension entrepreneurs to sustain society’s welfare. Currently, I work at an investment fund that focuses on the sustainable energy transition – which allows me to work with entrepreneurs who share this passion. 
I always look to deliver optimal results with a slight obsession for efficiency. My broad, international orientation allows me to understand the bigger scheme of things – which strengthens my entrepreneurial nature.

As a little girl I always knew that the World in my head differed to the one that I see.

Living in predictable grey USSR conformity was the norm – I walked a long way to reach the secret door and take my dreams and release myself from this cage.
• My artistic expression emanates from every fibre of my being – inherent skills transcending into a collage of colour and emotions reflecting my soul inspired by human beauty. (Skills can be taught but if you don’t have creativity in your body then your work won’t shine. Or have soul!)
My art is born out of chaos.
Every time I'm working on a new project I worry like a pregnant woman awaiting her child.
Hundreds of layers, coloured dots, straight and curly lines in various directions. They are silent, yet tell the miracle inside. I give myself time to merge with what nature has created. While standing in front of the canvas, time reveals to me what nature has shaped.: “Tell me your story?!''
 Suddenly, dots and lines transform into objects and into organic shapes or animals, fish and people. Hands are the mere veins between Heaven and Earth, so I use my hands, fingers to transfer the living energy of mine to the surface. Chaos finds its highest order."

Because no discipline has all answers and is only a part by definition. Bringing disciplines together allows us to access a wider variety of ways to consider solutions for ongoing challenges.

I might every now and then try to persuade someone to have real feathers installed, such as crow, seagull, or brown turkey. Or maybe the more historical slant-cut dampers instead of the rather modernist square flag dampers, and so allow the lush resonance of the sympathetic resonance of the undamped choir. A restringing, when it is due, might be contemplated with Nuremberg Iron, or p-wire. which has some outstanding qualities over previously available soft-iron wire. But every instrument will receive quality time and attention, and will be regulated to a crisp and precise toucher that will stimulate eloquent articulation and flowing ornaments. Apart from harpsichords, I have a lot of expertise in repairing and optimizing string instruments from India, I make sarangi bows and rehair them, and am an experienced jivari-maker for tanpuras."

Ik begeleid mensen persoonlijk en als team om slimmer te werken met meer focus en plezier. Ook ga ik graag samenwerkingen aan waarbij ik vanuit een coördinerende rol ondersteuning en advies bied om processen te optimaliseren.
Mijn missie is om de organisatie van werk door vakgebieden heen aan te pakken (IT, processen, werkgewoontes en communicatie) op een manier die echt past bij jou of je organisatie. Slim organiseren mét aandacht voor de mens.

TEAMBEGELEIDING
Te veel werk en weinig focus en overzicht leiden binnen jouw team tot stress, gemiste deadlines en minder werkplezier. Informatie is niet altijd vindbaar, afstemming is matig en kennis wordt niet optimaal benut. Sommige teamleden hebben niet (meer) de motivatie om dit samen te doorbreken. Hoe kom je nog tot goede resultaten?
Ik kijk anders en begeleid teams om weer effectief en plezierig samen te werken en resultaten te behalen, zelfs als dat hybride of asynchroon is. Ik stimuleer creativiteit en betrokkenheid waardoor ieder zijn verantwoordelijkheid ziet voor hoe jullie als team samenwerken. Je team werkt weer vanuit een duidelijke focus: ze gebruiken systemen optimaal, nemen samen besluiten, en weten precies wie wat gaat doen. Als iemand er even niet is of vertrekt, blijft kennis geborgd en kun je samen door.

PERSOONLIJKE BEGELEIDING
Je ervaart onrust, stress, een verlaagde productiviteit of bent zelfs uitgevallen. Je wordt geleefd door de waan van de dag, kunt je niet concentreren of stelt dingen uit. Timemanagement-methodes lijken niet bij je te passen en voelen vooral als nóg meer werk.
Je wilt weer grip op je werk, controle over je planning en rust in je hoofd hebben. Zodat je weer energie hebt om te doen wat je het liefst doet, maar dan wel op een manier die past bij wie je bent. Daarom heb je maatwerk nodig: jij als persoon bent het uitgangspunt.

ONORTHODOX MAATWERK:
Ik benader jouw probleem multidisciplinair en tegendraads, vanuit mijn expertise en ervaring in diverse functies en branches. Waar jij geen oplossing ziet, ga ik 'aan': ik krijg er energie van om tóch te bereiken wat niet mogelijk leek. Ik lever maatwerk buiten de gebaande paden om, zodat jij slimmer en effectiever werkt en daar weer plezier in hebt.

DUURZAAM PRODUCTIEF WORDEN?
Plan via mijn website of DM een ‘Slimmer Werken-Gesprek’ in. Dan maken we kennis en krijg je in 30 minuten duidelijk wat je doelstelling is en welke obstakels in de weg staan om daar te komen. Ik vertel je welke eerste stap je nu direct kunt zetten om dit te veranderen."

Learning, humanitarian services, development projects and writing are my passions and I have devoted my working life to these. At 24, I found my first and recurring love working for the Red Cross. How can I not keep coming back? The intense first weeks of a disaster operation, the incredible volunteers and the way they remind you of your smallness, the way the Red Cross does so much with so little.

I have been very fortunate to enjoy a successful career across a broad range of internal and field-based Red Cross emergency operations and programmes; meeting wonderful people and doing what I love – planning, monitoring, delivering and facilitating development initiatives. 

Specialising in leadership, management and team development strategy/interventions, strategic planning retreats and performance management, I have influenced at a local, national and international level. My accomplishments have helped shape learning and development policies, process and procedure; translating strategies, corporate objectives and performance goals into comprehensive training programmes for global teams.

Myself in a nutshell: With a background in tourism studies I took on every international challenge that came my way. This allowed me to travel the world in my 20s which was absolutely fantastic. I've lived in the most amazing places such as the USA, Australia, New Zealand, Belize, and Ecuador. Over the years I’ve developed skills and insights to adapt quickly to any business environment and I often find creative ways to reach goals without making any concessions.

My expertise isn’t limited to a single area; I’m currently involved with the Dutch Union of Charted Controllers (the VRC). A non-profit organization in Finance that aims to promote the Register Controller title through research & education and bring together Executive Masters of Finance and Control (EMFC) alumni—quite a mouthful, I know. Here I'm head of the Business Development Department where our main focus is contributing to the board's strategic decision makings and translating short- & long-term vision into smaller feasible projects.

And thank you for taking the time to visit my LinkedIn profile.

What you need to know about me? I am passionate about helping people make informed decisions. I love to start up new and exciting business initiatives. Since as long as I can remember I have had a truly global perspective on work, study and life. Traveling the world as a student and gaining my first serious working experience as a Sales manager in South America, since then I had number of middle and higher management positions in which I worked either abroad (in Spain and Germany) or in which I worked from within multi-cultural and international teams in the Netherlands.

Whether it's pitching new ideas, starting up new projects and bringing results and growth, I love exploring. 

My ambitions for the future are to keep exploring and at minimum work in positions in which I can put my skills at work and make a contribution to my employer’s success on a daily basis. Moreover I would love to work for companies that really aim to make a difference, ranging from making products and services that contribute to making the world a better place to companies which combat the challenges of our time such as climate change and fair production practices.

If you would like to be in touch to exchange ideas, questions, advice or a collaboration please feel  welcome to contact me any time.

All my experiences as been acquired all over the years working in Hotels, Real Estate and Catering  companies that due to the nature of the job allowed me to travel around the world working and connecting with different  cultures in international working environments learning and exchanging experiences and knowledge.
As an independent broker and trough my network I’m able to provide the local knowledge and the resources to find the best asset. 

Present & passion

In my other day by day activity I keep running a Restaurant & Private Dining services dedicated to provide services for individuals, institutions and companies as:

She creates captivating virtual landscapes and environments that allude to alternate worlds and possible futures. She uniquely blends design research with fiction and worldbuilding to create thought-provoking narratives that explore social issues and emerging technologies.

Her unique perspective on worldbuilding and pioneering work in game world therapy have gained her recognition across prestigious platforms around the world such as Vogue, Elle Decor, and FRAME Magazine.

Bianca's recent solo exhibition, 'Gen C: Children of 2050,' demonstrated her ability to spark critical and creative thinking about the future through immersive installations and accompanying workshops, which allowed thousands of participants to build off of her work about the climate crisis. Her game-changing project, Bump Galaxy, where she created a Minecraft server for mental healthcare, showcased her ingenuity, as she provided virtual landscapes and gaming experiences for care during the challenging times of the COVID-19 pandemic. During that time, she grew it to 3,000,000+ sqm of digital biomes for various forms of therapy and proved that playing together could mean caring for each other.

She has exhibited in Dutch Design Week, London Design Biennale, Triennale di Milano, Het Nieuwe Instituut and Tetem. She has even collaborated with Vogue Philippines on a 16-page spread and cover story on Philippine identity in the metaverse.

Through her workshops across Europe and Asia, she also shares her expertise with young people to learn about Futures Literacy through art. Collaborating with esteemed institutions such as Tetem, Iceland University of the Arts, Hogeschool voor de Kunsten Utrecht (HKU) and University of San Marino, Bianca has made a significant impact in fostering creativity and futures thinking.

Bianca Carague's body of work serves as a testament to her dedication to provoke thought about the world we live in and the world we aspire to create.

Board member of BA/MA/ResMA in Latin American Studies.

Prior to joining Leiden, I taught at the University of Oxford, where I was also Senior Research Associate at the Oxford Centre for Brazilian Studies, before moving to the University of Leeds. At Leiden, I teach in the fields of Brazilian and Lusophone literature and visual cultures, but I also teach on topics of Latin American  culture,  narratives of migration and urban space, representations of the urban night. 

My research focuses mainly on Brazil, with broader research interests in the cultures of the Portuguese-speaking world, including in transnational perspective. I work on literature and film, with a particular attention to travel and migrant and diasporic narratives, postcoloniality, (de)constructions of national identity, gender, space and landscape. This has led to the completion of several projects on Brazilian modernism, Afro-Brazilian women literature,  spatial politics, the road movie in the Lusophone world, on which I have published widely.

My interest in mobility and space has more recently taken on a keener attention to the dimension of time and on experiences and cultural representations of the night. I was Project Leader of the European collaborative project Night Spaces: migration, culture and integration in Europe (NITE), funded by the Humanities in the European Research Area (HERA), 2019-22.  This project brought together the Universities of Leiden, UCL, Humboldt/Leuphana, Aarhus and Limerick, in studying public spaces at night associated with diverse migrant communities in 8 European cities – (nightspace.net).

I am founding member and co-leader of REBRAC (European Network of Brazilianists working in Cultural Analysis). Founded in 2014 with Prof. S. Dennison (Leeds) and Dr. T. Holmes (Queen’s Belfast).  https://rebrac.net/page/1/

I have held Visiting Professorships at the University of São Paulo (UNESP/Araraquara, Brazil), 2015, and at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora (Brazil, 2014). In 2021 I was Research Fellow at the Hanse-Wissenschaftskolleg Institute of Advanced Studies in Germany.

The total course takes four years; one preparatory year and three years of technical training. In the future we want to expand with courses especially for girls.

Besides pure technical training, our emphasis lies on training future entrepreneurs, because entrepreneurship is one of the best ways to develop a region or country. Education and Entrepreneurship, that’s our slogan. We focus on youngsters in rural areas, because there the need is the highest.

Who wants to have his car fixed by a garage without properly trained personnel? Would you let your computer to be serviced by somebody without the needed knowledge? Probably not! So, technical training is needed, especially in developing countries.

I could tell you about the 20 or so years of experience as learning and change process specialist; about my deep expertise in group/process design & facilitation, knowledge management, strategic communication, change management, monitoring & evaluation. About my experience and interest in working with individuals, organisations and multi-stakeholder collaboratives. About my strong footing in non-profit development work in gender, agriculture, water/sanitation/hygiene [WASH] in Africa, Latin America, Europe.

But really, what matters is this: If you care about improving this world, and want to work on this with people in an intelligent and respectful manner (for each other and for the environment); if you want your folks to connect deeply, meaningfully, in collective intelligence and heart, I’m here to help! 

My mission is to help people, networks and organisations realise, value and use the power of collaboration & learning. I want to work with you and help understand, use and develop your collaboration capacity (your’ process literacy’) so you can connect with people deeply and effectively, across functions, disciplines and cultures. And particularly to get a crack at complex problems we can't address on our own...

My work is thus social: I want to help people connect, learn and transform themselves, the communities they are part of and discover new networks and ways of being and doing. For this I work with participatory facilitation and engagement techniques, face-to-face and online. I have managed, facilitated, trained, coached people and 150 groups (of 4 up to 300 people).  

My work is also analytical: I love concepts, strategies, processes and approaches; I engage in action-research, develop proposals, strategies, concept notes, working plans, tools, training materials, thought pieces, papers, articles and particularly blog posts around knowledge management/learning and group facilitation. 
 
I love languages and speak five of them at the moment (French, English, Dutch, Spanish, German) -
with some notions of Amharic (the main language in Ethiopia). 

My vision: a world where people realise their connection to the world and each other, become and help others become leaders through empathy, personal reflection and collaboration. Love, light and learning for a better world.

Ambachtsschool

Met de steun van Amsterdamse studenten en anderen heeft Stichting M.O.E.T. in 2009 een ambachtsschool kunnen openen in Bobo Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. In juli 2012 zijn de eerste leerlingen afgestudeerd en op dit moment gaan er 152 leerlingen naar deze school! Zij worden opgeleid in een van de volgende ambachten: mechanica, automechanica, metaalbewerking of elektrotechniek. Daarnaast krijgen zijn ook computerlessen en volgen vakken als wiskunde en Frans. De nieuwe Brevet d'Etudes Professionnelles (BEP) opleiding biedt leerlingen bovendien de kans om verder te studeren na het behalen van hun basiscertificaat in hun ambacht. Met deze vaardigheden zijn de afgestudeerde leerlingen in staat om producten te bewerken en ontwikkelen, of bijvoorbeeld vrachtwagens en auto’s te onderhouden en repareren. Door het verwerven van deze vaardigheden kunnen ze in de toekomst zelfvoorzienend worden en de leefomstandigheden van hun gehele familie verbeteren. 

Landbouwschool

Het idee om een landbouwschool te bouwen is ontstaan uit het gegeven dat het overgrote deel van de economie in Burkina Faso agrarisch is. Het vergroten van de agrarische kennis kan daarom veel positieve veranderingen brengen. Met onderwijs een toekomst is en blijft de gedachte van stichting M.O.E.T. en met dit project hopen we daarom het agrarische onderwijs te steunen in Burkina Faso. In 2013 zijn wij begonnen met het bouwen van een Landbouwschool in de buurt van Toussiana, een dorp een uur rijden van Bobo Dioulasso. Afgelopen jaar was de bouw afgerond en heeft de school haar deuren geopend voor veertig leerlingen. De meeste van deze leerlingen komen van ver en verblijven hierdoor dag en nacht op het schoolterrein. Aangezien de school dit jaar nog een proefjaar draait en de officiële opening in oktober plaats zal vinden, zijn de veertig leerlingen van nu elke dag bezig om te helpen met het klaar te maken van de grond en de dierenverblijven. Hier leren deze jongeren enorm veel van."

Een pitch in het Nederlands:

Wat heeft onze watersnoodramp van ‘53 gemeenschappelijk met de wijdse zandvlaktes van de Sahara? Beiden hebben een gigantische impact op de mensen die in die omgeving wonen. Kennis van onze leefomgeving maakt ons niet minder afhankelijk van die leefomgeving, maar wel weerbaarder. Daarom werk ik, Cheryl Van Kempen, als docent geo-ICT bij Aeres hogeschool in Almere, bij de opleidingen Geo, Media & Design; Aarde & Klimaat en Duurzame bedrijfskunde. Ik begon als milieu-geocheem, maar stond al snel bekend als de wizzkid die grote hoeveelheden data tot informatieve statistieken, inzichtelijke kaarten, grafieken of bevraagbare databases kon verwerken. Online & offline en het liefst geautomatiseerd. Of het nu om gemeten data, satellietgegevens of model in-of uitvoer gaat. Uit droge getallen ontfutsel ik betekenis zodat ze bijdragen de ontwikkeling van een duurzame samenleving.

Each film has its own substantive challenge and dynamics in the team of makers. The great thing is that documentaries can be about anything: social topics, journalism, art, culture, human interest. In form they are observational, interview driven, ego documents, discourse, animation, experimentation and hybrid forms. In short, I am at home in all markets.

I am conducting research related to the development of an agroforestry project in the Sahel, as well as a Value Chain Analysis for african superfood.

I finished my Bachelors in International Business with the Specialization in Emerging Markets at Maastrich University in the summer of 2020. After high-school, I developed a strong interest in Latin America and travelled within the region for seven months whilst learning Spanish. This experience motivated me to pursue my Bachelors in Maastricht, where, thanks to the specialisation, I was able to further deepen my knowledge about the most pressuring problems of our time. The unique programme was focusing on the rising economic powers, like the BRICS countries, and teaches business and economics from a different cultural, political and economic perspective. I was lucky enough to have had the opportunity to conduct an internship at the German Embassy in Managua, Nicaragua, whilst writing my Bachelor Thesis about the ""Socio-economic and environmental impact of sustainability certification on small-holder cocoa farmers in Nicaragua"".

Having graduated, I decided to follow my passion for French language and volunteered on an organic farm in the mountains of ""Les Cévennes"" in the south of France for 2 months. The place and the people inspired me and I reconnected with nature and especially forests whilst helping with daily farmwork, such as repairing fences and doing firewood.
Wanting to work within the agricultural and rural development sector in the future, this experience ultimately pushed me to start following my dream of working within the Sahel region.

Some more facts about me: 
In my freetime I love doing sports (I'm a passionate tennis player and recently discovered different yoga styles), expand my handcrafting skills, read, and enjoy time outside in nature with friends."

I also taught journalism courses, mostly on narrative journalism. And I coordinated the first Dutch conference on Narrative Journalism.

My focus is mainly on in-depth stories in The Netherlands and (West) Africa. I have worked on topics such as social aspects of climate change, migration, poverty, conflict and reconciliation, land rights, and natural resource management. More recently my focus is on media in west Africa.

Besides the topic matter as such, the question of how to tell a story in the most compelling way is driving my work and stimulating my creativity. The challenge is to find out what works best. And that might be different for every new story.

I still do feel connected to my academic roots  - anthropology and human geography. This comes to the fore in my journalism - I feel at home in the documentary kind of reporting based on thorough research. 
As an anthropologist I studied indigenous soil and water conservation in particular and natural resource management more in general in Burkina Faso. Thereafter I delved into the concept of 'time' among a group of farmers in northern Benin. 
Methodological questions have my special interest. Besides research, I taught introductory courses on African development issues at the university. 
I participated in the Resilience Academy, a kind of think tank on climate change consisting of academics and practitioners, initiated by the UN University in Bonn and financed by the Munich Re: Foundation. Currently, I am working part-time for Voice4Thought, a foundation focused on media, research and artistic expression in West Africa.

Tengo experiencia en la construcción de equipos para innovar soluciones para nuestros clientes, ya que cada uno de ellos presenta una casuística distinta, y a afrontar todo tipo de situaciones y eventualidades en la gestión de proyectos, las cuales me ayudaron a desarrollar algunas de las habilidades que hoy en día son un activo real para mí. 

Soy una persona muy responsable y organizada, y me gusta estar orientada a resultados, ser minuciosa en los detalles y alcanzar los objetivos propuestos.

Me siento cómoda trabajando como parte de un equipo (valoro la comunicación abierta y el respeto), aunque tampoco tengo ningún inconveniente en desempeñar mi trabajo de manera individual. 

Estoy acostumbrado a trabajar bajo presión y con deadlines, por lo que este ambiente dinámico me no me provoca ningún tipo de problema o descenso en mi productividad.

Me siento motivada y tengo una actitud positiva hacia aquello que emprendo y siempre busco la productividad y sinergias.

Actualmente, la situación económica actual no es fácil pero también la hace más interesante y supone un reto que debe motivarnos para conseguir que las empresas sean una herramienta de desarrollo personal y profesional, que cumplan mejor que nunca las expectativas de los clientes. Y por otro lado, esta situación debería hacernos reflexionar sobre qué se hizo mal para corregir y mejorar, especialmente, los que escogimos esta profesión."
