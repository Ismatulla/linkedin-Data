Skilled in Petroleum geology and geophysics through seismic interpretation, with a special interest in Seismic Attributes and AvO and a passion -and track record- for coaching our new generation of subsurface specialists. Strong consulting professional with a Mr science in geophysics, physics and computer sciences from University of Utrecht. 

Established the 'SeismicO' company in 2018 as a vehicle for short term consult & assurance on critical elements of the seismic interpretation workflow.

After drilling, seismic data is often the single biggest operational investment. Do you monetise all of that intrinsic value in your seismic data? In order to extract maximum value, is the data in shape? Have your staff looked into it’s AvO potential? Is your local earth response in the seismic data adequately calibrated and understood through well ties? 

My 35 years of experience in the energy industry as subsurface specialist, trainer and coach, might just help lift your staff and project to the next higher level!

This work includes vectorisation, cache blocking,  better (MPI and OpenMP) scalable algorithms, optimisation of data throughput and IO, and porting to the latest architectures (e.g. Slingshot, GPU, ARM). 

My research in Geophysics (0.2) is focused on novel seismic imaging and processing techniques. Implementing, testing and verifying new methods is part of my work at TU Delft. The work I enjoy most is working together with PhD's and staff on challenging problems. My weekly working day in Delft is always too short. Back home I'm still full of ideas I could continue working on. 

My ambition lies in deepening my knowledge by learning new techniques and apply them to solve and implement complicated problems in an efficient way on modern compute hardware. I'm an expert in meta-programming to write lean, efficient and excellent performing code.  I would love to gain more knowledge about AI and combine it with various (deterministic) numerical techniques. 

Working in HPC with multi disciplinary teams on technical challenging problems is my favourite kind of work.  For me teamwork is key to solve scientific problems. 

In my function at HPE-Cray I have presented courses about HPC and MPI,  organised HPC workshops at international conferences (EAGE) and contributed to many scientific codes as pre-sales analyst. In 20 years I gained experience in weather and climate codes (HARMONIE/AROME, (Nor)CESM, FESOM, WRF), CFD (OpenFOAM), material science, quantum mechanics.

Playing a large part in design, equipping and managing the build of the highly successful PGS S-class Ramform. My role was in overall  management of the project: cost control and evaluation of technology improvements as well as managing design changes.

Improving fleet-wide vessel performance at PGS to a very high level; mostly achieved without major capex through a consistent improvement plan, interaction with sales, fostering best practice and diligent selection of equipment. A significant component of the succes was also due to the cooperation with streamer and electronics manufacturers, whereby very strict pre-delivery testing was introduced.

During this time, I was also a student assistant at the Mathematical Institute of this University.

In 2019, I completed my bachelor’s in industrial and Applied Mathematics at the Delft University of Technology. As part of the bachelor’s I completed a minor at the University of Nebraska, Omaha in Mathematics and Physics. Among others, I followed the course Modern Geometry, which discussed axiomatic Euclidean and elliptic geometry. This greatly increased my interest in the field of geometry. As such, I decided to do my bachelor thesis on axiomatic projective geometry.

Because of its expertise in geometry, I decided to pursue a master’s degree at Leiden University, which is a two-year program. Since I had to catch up some of the necessary background knowledge, I spent extra time in catching up on subjects such as ring and field theory, which are part of the bachelor’s program at Leiden University.

Photography. It is my way. Every picture is a story and a reality on its own. Photographing is my way to tell my stories and to create and express my reality. Personal, pure and human, that is how I like my photography. It is my love as well as my profession.

I was a kid, only six years old, and I was given an enticing present by my grandfather ~ Cornelis Wairata ~ . This present, which would stay with me forever, was my first camera. Ever since, I have been making photographs. A passion for life…..
At the age of 21 I started to be a professional photographer. For 10 years I was making my photographs for a living and then decided to do a study: Creative Photography at the Academy of Photography in Amsterdam. And why? Ha, I do invite you to ask me….

Always looking for new challenges, but drawn in particular towards making portraits and photo reports. The main reason? I am just in love with art and theatre….

Besides, I have a pronounced interest in symbolism and geometry; natural shapes you can find all throughout nature.
 
I love to play….. like a child….as pure as it gets…
 
I love to play with the ideas people come up with. Especially when there is room to experiment. Room to create a new reality together.

I obtained the degree of “Ingeniero Civil” from the UNSJ (Argentina) in 2001. I then worked as a structural engineer for two years before I was awarded the prestigious Fulbright Scholarship to pursue further studies in USA. I received my MSc in 2006 and my PhD in 2010 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). My PhD dissertation focused on the design of microvascular biomimetic materials. During my Ph.D. program, I received the Mavis Memorial Scholarship Award for academic excellence and research accomplishments. After my Ph.D., I held two postdoc appointments, where I studied the modeling of heterogeneous materials (UIUC) and computational contact mechanics (EPFL, Switzerland).

My Ph.D. program and postdoctorate positions shaped my research profile strongly on numerical methods. My research focuses on the creation of new enriched finite element technology and its application for solving complex engineering problems. I have worked on the design of novel materials and structures, the damage response of complex microstructures, the analysis and design of metamaterials—and phononic crystals in particular. My latest research efforts revolve on the creation of new enriched finite element methods for decoupling problem topology from finite element meshes when resolving discontinuities (e.g., material interfaces, cracks, and boundaries). My knowledge on enriched FEM is also taught in my own courses ""Advanced Finite Element Methods (ME46050),"" and ""Enriched Finite Element Methods (ME46080)"" at TU Delft. I am also collaborating on a book entitled ""Fundamentals of Enriched Finite Element Methods.""

Research interests:
1. Development of numerical methods for solving PDEs in solid mechanics, including • linear/nonlinear elasticity • contact mechanics • fracture mechanics • multiscale mechanics • immersed boundary (fictitious domain) problems • fluid-structure interaction. Methods include enriched finite element, virtual element, and spectral element methods • single and multi-objective optimization • topology optimization • genetic algorithms • machine (deep) learning.

2. Application of these methods to the computational analysis or design of novel(meta)materials and structures, including biomimetic materials • composites • acoustic metamaterials • origami."

I quickly understood that to approach these complex issues, History and Philosophy’s knowledge would be necessary, as both provide the ubiquitous and diachronic analytical tools to analyze the Political process. Thus, within my high-school, bachelor, and master’s years, I have studied Politics from a historical and philosophical perspective.

My PhD dissertation was about the Web and history education, a subject that allowed me to explore ways in which pupils come to, and use, online historical information. My research has mostly covered (alternative forms of) journalism, ethics of journalism, cultural memory (and its political implications), among others. At this moment I am busy thinking about writing Vol 3 of Memory Traps (www.memorytraps.com), the series that serves as a framework for me to reflect upon cultural memory, ethnicity, and politics in Rwanda from various perspectives. 

My professional background is in online journalism and radio reporting. I have worked for international media outlets, but I decided to also explore citizen journalism starting from 2007, as a trainer and coach. I believe that we can be better informed as citizens if local communities were involved in the journalistic process as news producers. Between 2007 and 2014 I trained more than 100 citizen journalists in 9 African countries in mobile reporting. With the mobile phone and some training, they have most of what they need to be part of the media landscape."

My motto is ""Pride in the Past, Ownership of the Future""

I am particularly interested in combining history of science with STEM/STEAM education.

I have a great passion for science and history of science communication and popularization. I have considerable experience in ""hands-on"" teaching of history of science by means of ""hands-on"" workshops. I have given workshops on Arabic science such as astrolabe workshop or workshop on geometric patterns in Islamic art in many countries.


I have also considerable experience with curatorial work. 

As one of my latest projects, for the Turkish Presidential Nation's Library, i have developed a exhibition with the title ""History of Islamic Science in 100 objects"" . The exhibition, which  consists of 100 objects of which are 87 replicas and 13 authentic medieval scientific manuscripts. The exhibition which opened it doors in April, 2021 has since been travelling. 

As the curator of the exhibition, I also wrote a 220+ page exhibition catalog for the exhibition, which is available both in Turkish and English. 

I also do consultancy work for auction houses where I am regularly asked to analyze, describe and evaluate medieval Arabic/Islamic scientific instruments & manuscripts."

I continued my activities as the focal point of a newly set up daugther company, which led to the essential knowledge of a multinational environment. The complexity of this challenge allowed me to coordinate several fields of activities in the same time, providing a general overview about the basic procedures of a multinational. The main focus was commercial management and daily communication with customers. With evoving the company’s size, I also got the chance to contribute to redistribution of the tasks on management level.

Due to changes in my location and professional career, I started widening my field of activities with learning psychology and practising art and dance therapy. Being a freelance interpreter at this period allowed me to harmonize the old and new fields of activities.

For me, history springs from the perennial human concern with self-discovery. While historical research and writing can never be completely shorn of its political nature, I believe that this work can also be considered an anthropological science which adds many layers of understanding to present-day problems.

My intention to study management of cultural heritage was driven mostly by my will to acquire a thorough understanding of the managerial practices and a wide array of instruments to critically evaluate them as well as knowledge of the artistic development through centuries. Over the past years, I had the opportunity to lay solid foundations in terms of both quantitative skills and economic theory revolving around cultural enterprises, deepening my knowledge of curatorial practices and legal institutes in addition to strengthening the study of the cultural heritage in its many manifestations. This has directed my enthusiasm to the role of institutions, international organizations, and NGOs in managing this relationship and in creating meaningful interchange between the territory, the cultural expression, and visitors.

At the moment my research interest covers three areas: the relationship between the education provided to young art professionals and the work market, opportunities for artists to find new forms to exhibit and share their artworks, and sustainable management of cultural heritage. 

Given my fond, long-term interest in the management of cultural heritage, sustainability, and accessibility of the arts which go beyond my more recent yet strong drive towards institutional responsibilities in these fields, I am committed and interested in all experiences that enhance my capabilities and push my boundaries both as a student and as a cultural leader through a balance between quantitative, qualitative research, and practice."

(2015). African Hairitage in Late Modern Europe: Exploring Individual and Social Factors in Hair Evaluations of Women with Afro-textured Hairstyles. [Master’s thesis, Tilburg University].

Contemporary Dutch society has diversified both ethnically and culturally as a result of globalization. Nowadays ethnic minorities make up more than half of the residents in the country’s four largest cities changing them into so‐called majority‐minority cities. The super‐diversity characteristic for these cities is clearly visible in street scenes flattering people with different identity markers such as ethnicity, attire, religion, hairstyle and so on. More than skin colour, hair has always been an important factor in defining one’s status and identity and although black hairstyles and identity have had extensive scholarly attention from mainly American scholars, little is known about the identity constructions related to afro‐textured hairstyles from a European perspective. Drawing on the novel Culturometrics methodology this research therefore aims to acquire both descriptive and analytic insight in the meaning of hair in the cultural identity constructions of women with afro‐textured hairstyles in the super‐diverse urban spaces of Late Modern Europe."

Andrew DJ Shield is Assistant Professor of Migration History at Leiden University, where he specializes in the sexuality, migration, and diversity in Europe since 1945.

BOOKS:
Dr. Shield's first book, Immigrants in the Sexual Revolution: Perceptions and Participation in Northwest Europe (Palgrave Macmillan, 2017), historicizes European debates about the sexual politics of immigrants from Muslim-majority regions, and challenges dominant theories linking immigration to sexual conservatism and misogynistic behaviour. 

His second book -- Immigrants on Grindr: Race, Sexuality and Belonging Online (Palgrave Macmillan, 2019) -- explores the importance of hook-up apps in the lives of gay and queer immigrants in Scandinavia, and how the online culture of these platforms promotes belonging or exclusion.

EDUCATION:
He holds one PhD in History from the Graduate Center of the City University of New York (2015), supervised by Dr. Dagmar Herzog, and a second PhD in Communication from Roskilde University in Denmark (2018) within Dr. Rikke Andreassen's ""New Media, New Intimacies"" research group.

As a natural thinker and creative person I have a broad range of interests ranging from news, politics and history, to art, science and biology. Writing and creative work are perhaps my most defining skillsets. In both these areas, I like to imagine that my original, but approachable style is what sets me apart. When it comes to writing I can be quite versatile: I am interested in academic style writing, but also commercial work, news articles, opinion pieces or anything else with a creative edge. The same is true for illustration and design; as long as there is originality involved, I am up for the job!

In day to day life, I am a sociable person who likes to surround himself with friends and family, but I can also very much enjoy spending time on my own. When applied to my professional life, this means that I can thrive inside a team, as well as work on projects individually for extended periods of time. Always in search of new inspiration, I am open to other ways of thinking and like to discuss all kinds of topics and ideas.

When it comes to my intellectual endeavours, the large, all-encompassing stories have often captured my imagination the most. And so, when conducting historiography, my focus regularly lies with the big questions and broad, sweeping histories. When studying a historic theme, I look at the large structures of imeaning and nterconnectedness and try to unravel how they developed over time. My preferred approach may thus be described as ""total history"", while the subject matter often falls into the category of cultural history or the history of mentalities, as exemplified by the Annales school.

Creatively, I have practiced many branches of art, both traditional and digital. Drawing pencil work of historical subjects, fantasy and science fiction has always been a favoured pass-time for me. I also have a lot of experience in pixel art, digital illustration and logo design and I am well acquainted with Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop and Premiere.

Hoping to have provided you with a sensible overview of who I am and what I do. 

If you'd like to connect feel free to hit me up with a message! I am always open to exchange ideas, even in the most casual way!"

My experience & expertise:
Oral history ~Qualitative methods ~field based research ~lecturing bachelor students ~developing and coordinating curricula ~individual student supervision ~interviewing & collecting life stories ~conducting and coordinating oral history projects ~organizing story telling workshops ~ providing oral history training and workshops ~writing ~blogging

My activities: 
As an oral historian, I collect life stories of migrant families and their offspring in books, blogs, websites, and exhibitions. Being born into a family that was diverse in terms of gender, race, class, and sexuality, I know by experience what it means to be silenced and marginalized. By collecting the life stories of migrant families, I encourage them to speak up and become the owner of their own (hi)stories, thus countering dominant narratives around migrants and the or offspring. 
My latest oral history projects are the storytelling project Antara Nusa based on my latest book Antara Nusa that reveals the lives and experiences of elderly Amsterdammers who have roots in the former Dutch East Indies/Indonesia. Check https://lmpublishers.nl/catalogus/antara-nusa/.  
With our curriculum Ancestors Unknown Nederland, we encourage school kids in diverse classrooms to discover their ancestors and family histories through genealogy lessons (oral history interviewing and archival search) and history lessons on colonial and migration histories. Our recent program 'Tracing Your Roots' invites young adults in the former Dutch East Indies to pursuit the same search for their roots and their ancestors, thus encouraging them to envision their own identity and relation to our colonial past. 
Next to my work as an oral historian, I have 10 years of experience in lecturing in qualitative research methods and supervising bachelor students in their thesis. 
Next to these projects, I'm currently working on finalizing my PhD on migration, family, and identity in the life stories of Javanese-Surinamese women in the Netherlands

I indulge in every honest conversation as FAMILY COUNSELOR at our school and in my supporting role caring for vulnerable mothers at Leger des Heils, Kleur Cafe Den Haag and Het Rachamhuis.

Besides voluntary work and studying I make time for counseling sessions during a walk in The Hague.

Mothers face stressful times in every new phase in life, where they lose contact with their maternal instinct and are unable to see the full picture to reclaim and delegate responsibilities as mature leaders.

""KIND WALKS COUNSELING""
https://www.instagram.com/p/CnkiI4ItvgQ/?igshid=NjZiM2M3MzIxNA==

“HOLDING SPACE” provides a moment free of judgement, solutions or a plan that allows women to gain back ownership, vitality, resilience and hope simply by freely expressing their struggles preventing feelings of shame, guilt, confusion and isolation that often result in physical and mental health issues.

""AUTHENTICITY is the fruit of the courage that arises when we fully embrace our personality and history"".

Working out your GENOGRAM combined with the right questions, we unravel patterns, convictions and the effects passed on through GENERATIONS. 
Your physical struggles will also lead us to a full understanding, freedom and relief. 

Reflecting about our generational history produces Kindness and Gratitude for our life and Curiosity for our purpose. We will develop empathy, understanding and compassion for ourselves and others. 

I overcame irritable bowl syndroom, frozen shoulders, several allergies, people pleasing, burnouts and depression without the need of medication or therapy. As a living example of our body's SELF-HEALING ability based on the POLYVAGAL THEORY I am happy to help you out.  

Kind Walks offers company to CHRONICALLY SICK WOMEN that have understood the benefits of a daily walk but are in need of discipline, a new routine and accountability.
Depending on your condition we will meet during 2-3 months to walk together building up condition and a routine so that you will experience all the benefits and get used to walking on your own or inviting otters.

Choosing for solitude and self reflection during MINDFUL WALKING also heals, then you can count on my accountability. 

Everything Kind Walks offers is based on a free contribution and 25% of the profit is donated to Stichting Groundwork."

She works on European political and social history from the nineteenth century onwards, with a special interest in both the institutional as well as the popular experience of war and conflict, and the Second World War in particular. This translates to a focus on issues such as restorative justice, expropriation and confiscation of enemy property and Jewish assets. Core themes in her research are citizenship as mechanism of inclusion and exclusion, state- and nationhood, policy-making and governance in times of (post-) conflict and crisis, transitional justice and human rights.

Marieke Oprel has published on the classification and categorization of German nationals and Jewish German refugees in the aftermath of the Second World War. In 2020, she successfully defended her dissertation called ‘The Burden of Nationality. Dutch citizenship policies towards German nationals in the aftermath of the Second World War’, a project which was funded by NWO (Dutch Research Council). Her dissertation was published as a monograph by VU University Press. In 2021, she published a Dutch-language monograph for a larger audience, called ‘Afrekenen met de vijand’.

Recent publications include contributions to the volumes Property Rights in Wartime
Sequestration, Confiscation and Restitution in Twentieth-Century Europe (Routledge, 2023), Narratives of War (Routledge, 2019), Information and Power in History (Routledge, 2020) and a special issue of the European Review of History on property rights in wartime (2021). She is also co-editor of a volume on the Dutch political party PPR (Boom, 2022) 

Marieke Oprel is passionate about bringing history to a larger public, of which the project ‘Expropriation of Jewish property in WWII and the restoration of rights’ is a telling example. She is PI of this Radboud University project commissioned by several municipalities in the Netherlands reconstructing the expropriation of Jews during the Second World War.

Currently, Marieke Oprel is conducting research on the key players in Dutch post-war property expropriation in collaboration with the Tax & Customs Museum in Rotterdam and Tilburg University. 

Marieke Oprel is the coordinator of the MA track of Political History, ‘Politics and Parliament’. She has extensive teaching experience and has supervised multiple BA- and MA-theses on a large variety of topics."

I studied English at university in the Faculty of Foreign Languages though, I started my career in sales for an advertising production company because, the beauty and impact of advertising fascinated me so much.And then,I studied graphic design while working as a sales representative and became a graphic designer.

From my actual career, I know that advertising is about beauty and a way of communicating with customers. I also know that times are changing and that we use different tools such as websites, emails and social networks to express our brand and communicate with our customers.

I started fasting to lose weight almost seven years ago.
Fasting was an excellent opportunity to awaken my senses, reset my taste buds and reflect on my diet. There, I was reintroduced to dashi, which is at the heart of Japanese food culture.
I started a webmedia called Oishiidashi to promote the excellence of dashi.

I then embarked on an experimental journey to Europe to spread the wonders of dashi throughout the world.
It is difficult to promote dashi in Europe because the food culture and water are different from those in Japan, but I was convinced that umami could be spread worldwide.

Umami is a flavour with health benefits, but unlike salt and sugar, it is difficult to detect.
However, umami has a cultural and historical background and is closely linked to industry.

And umami is not unique to Japan; people worldwide can taste it in local foods. Umami makes people healthier and happier. And it changes lives.

I want to do everything we can to spread the goodness of umami."

As a researcher I was working together with officials from the Dutch Repatriation and Departure Service to research various theories regarding the motivations for accepting the return decisions that irregular migrants receive to depart back to their countries of origin. 

My master’s thesis focused on the institutionalist theories of political change related to the changing national policies in the Netherlands and Belgium with regard to their immigration and deportation laws between 1990 -1996. 

(Inter)national issues have been front and center of most of my working, academic and personal life. Growing up in the Netherlands, Ukraine and Syria adds a broad, intercultural perspective to my work and research, one that can also be applied to both private and public institutions.

I first came in contact with GIS while doing archaeological fieldwork and was immediately hooked. In 2009 and 2010 I did GIS work for several archaeological campaigns where I learned the basics of mapping, data management and collecting data in the field. This spurred me on to get some proper qualifications and I graduated with my MSc in GIS from Edinburgh University in 2012. 

While working for the Forestry Commission I learned what a bespoke GIS system can do for a big organisation and what it entails to manage and progress a massive software project. Here I was part of a GIS team who together had more than 80 years of GIS experience! From the FC I moved on to a small charity, again a major change of scenery where GIS played a very different but equally important role. I was the only GIS professional within CSGNT which means I managed and performed all GIS-related tasks. In the last few years I have therefore been able to develop the technical skills that I was taught in my MSc and I used ArcGIS Desktop, ArcGIS Online, QGIS, PostGIS, FME and Geoserver on a daily basis. 

In 2016 this experience meant that I was able to move back to my home country, the Netherlands, where I started working at Esri Nederland in the position of Content Engineer. Here I continued to develop my technical and data-related skills. Within the team I mainly focused on spatial analysis, the maintenance of our content within our ArcGIS Online portal and sharing knowledge through blogs and presentations.

Currently I work at BeoBOM, who have offered me a joined position, combining my degrees in history and GIS. Here I perform historical research for possible sites of WWII explosives and I analyse field data using GIS. 

The thing that my experience so far has taught me is also the thing I love most about working with GIS: it can be used in so many different fields for so many different things in so many different ways. I am up for any challenge presented to me and am very much looking forward to them!"

The focus of my current research is on late Nineteenth and Twentieth Century developments in mathematics and physics education at the secondary school level in the Netherlands, most notably involving the rise of new technology in educational practice (which involves history of AI, new media and computing most notably). I enjoy projects which take original source material into account and emphasise the broad cultural implications of science (education). Most noteworthy, I like using cartoons, novels, film footage, diary or college notes as (additional) source material, to illustrate the impact of certain developments in society. Currently, I'm writing a textbook on the ""where and why"" of mathematics during the past 2500 years.

In a former life I also worked as a consultant in special educational needs, in which role I advised both individuals and institutions. Students with special educational needs still are one of my soft spots. Thereby I follow this general guideline. Pupils and students with special educational needs are confronted with heavier tasks than other pupils and students. Acknowledging this fact does NOT imply that these students are best served by lightening their task. If they are capable of achieving the same goals as their fellow pupils and students, they should be allowed to develop themselves to their full potential; if not, teachers and educators should have the decency of showing these pupils and students a respectable alternative. It would be very helpful if educational institutions would pay more attention to the careers (ie: do these fit the certificates they obtained) of their former students, instead of focussing on the graduation of their present student population."

André Nijsen is the founding father of the SCM. From 1992 onwards he started developing methodologies for measuring the compliance costs of regulation. In 1994 the first product was Mistral®, the forerunner of the SCM. In January 2003 he obtained his PhD at the Erasmus University Rotterdam. The title of his thesis is: ""Dancing with the Octopus; Information obligations of enterprises in the social constitutional state from a public administration point of view."" Mistral® is one of the corner stones of this thesis. In 2005/6 he developed a new module of the SCM to measure the compliance costs of substantive obligations for enterprises, called SIROCCO, Scanning Instrument on Regulations for Other Compliance Costs. 

Besides this theoretical work, André Nijsen has a lot of practical experience in implementing the SCM in so-called base line measurements in all policy areas. He was involved in all Dutch base line measurements (2002 and 2007). He did countless SCM projects on separate laws and regulations in the Netherlands and in other countries.

André Nijsen has a lot of (inter)national experience as an adviser in the field of regulatory reform. He advised national governments in e.g. the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, South-Africa, Belgium, Slovenia, Dubai, Luxemburg, Germany, Austria, Romania and Kazakhstan. He also advised the European Commission, EUROSTAT, the OECD and the World Bank Group. André Nijsen also has experience in training officials in the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, South Africa, Slovenia, Luxemburg, Germany, Austria, Montenegro, Albania and Serbia with the application of impact assessments in the field of administrative burdens (compliance costs assessments).
